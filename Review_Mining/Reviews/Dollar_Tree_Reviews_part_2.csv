good,"Dollar Tree is a very fast paced facility. You have plenty to do and there’s never a dull moment. Coworkers are very helpful, so is management. It was a pleasure."
good,I'm a manager a typical day at work stocking it's always hard working with people who don't want to corroborateyou're always going to get someone like that but there's always ways around it working together is the best key I enjoy working there I love to push out freight and I'm just happy to have a job.
good,The dm is amazing also helping where she can. Other store managers will help as well if needed. Being apart of a team there is amazing always something different
good,"The shifts are very short.  The days of the week were very few.  I had just relocated, and wanted to work more, but the manager had many people on staff, and always talked about not going over on her payroll."
good,dollar tree is a wonderful place to help you get by with working while in school. I didn't have good days or bad days I went to work got my job done and went home. the job was easy and I made sure my customers were always happy and satisfied.
good,What I loved about working at Dollar Tree is working with the friendly people an the pay was great an I really enjoyed stocking and unloading the fright off the truck
good,"The interview process was pretty simple. The work itself was simple, tedious at times. Holidays were crazy hectic but the coworkers and customers made it worth it. Barely hired for full-time unless hiring managers. So as part time you do not get any benefits. Pay wasn't too bad."
good,Not a bad place. Just needed better management pay was low but co workers where great an friendly the job itself was easy an not hard was easy to do an fun
good,They have a great staff. The hours were to my liking and around my schedule. I would advise anyone looking for a job go to dollar tree. I would work at dollar tree if i had to
good,I enjoyed the job and everything I was able to learn from working in there. Would recommend this job to anyone trying to get on their feet or fresh out of high school.
good,None to tell it was great to work there I had an emergency had to quit.close to home enjoyed the co.worker worked in the evening it was part time which I enjoyed
good,Worked there for almost 3 years and never had a major problem. Hours were good for a part time job and never had a problem with taking off whatever days I needed. They always kept you busy when on the job which made the shifts fly by.
good,"working at dollar tree was very helpful for mt retail work experience ,and the employees were realy helpfull and nice . "
good,The people I worked with were all nice and willing to help each other out for the most part. The only thing that got really annoying is that customers would often not tip resulting in not making as much money which sucked.
good,"A typical work day consist of being at the cash register. Talking to customers about their purchase merchandise. I learn a lot about how to operate the cash register, and how nice people really are when it comes to donations for children. Management was good, didn't have any problems at all. Workplace culture was friendly and fair. Hardest part was go back and stocking products. Most enjoyable part was, being relaxed and not so fast paced, every work day was as the last cool, calm, and collective."
good,"I enjoy my job at Dollar Tree thoroughly, however I don’t believe I am paid a fair wage. I will be the only employee on register, while also stocking shelves and drinks, and still expected to clean the store and put returns back. It is a fast paced job and not for anyone unwilling to work hard. However, all of the management is nice, and so are fellow employees."
good,I enjoyed being in a work environment. Wherever it may have been at the time I take my job seriously. I have gained a lot of experience. Best part about the job was being able to engage with a lot of people.
good,"i loved my job at the dollar it was one of my first jobs outside of the food industry. my co-workers were helpful and fun, my managers were great never really had any trouble there. they worked with my hours and made life easy with my kids."
good,I really enjoy working at dollar tree. They had a good environment and all the employees were really nice and helpful. I thought at first being cashier was going to be hard but it was really easy I got the hang of it right away.
good,"Is not a difficult job, you learn a lot about working with people. You build great relationships and learn to work as a team. You can also move up in this job fairly quickly based on your work performance."
good,"Prior to working at Dollar Tree i had other sales associate jobs. but for those that have never ran a register, this is a great entry level job to learn the ropes of greeting customers, handling cash and credit card transactions, and also how to up sell with the item of the week."
good,Just go do what you got to do.... the work isn't  hard at all... nice place to shop at and you would want to recommend it to everyone.... overall it's a decent place...
good,"At dollar tree I learned how to deal with customers who are being very rude, I learned more about working in retail. The most enjoyable part  of job was meeting different people every day."
good,"The work environment overall is good. The store managers are very nice and work with staff for when you need off. They don't allow overtime, plus most stores don't have hours to give."
good,"I really liked my job there and I wud absolutely go back. I liked that my boss worked with me if I had any issues wit my child, or a family issue. Great experience."
good,"fast paced environment, they gave me incentives bonus if i were to go over 100% production rate and a nice and friendly work environment. We would have our own ping pong tournaments with the coworkers."
good,While the job isn’t very hard it can be physically demanding and the pay just isn’t high enough for the amount of work done. A good leader goes a long way
good,would recommend to any one with good customer service skills.  fun fast paced work environment. 'needs to be well organized and work well with the public.
good,Dollar Tree from Superiority to subordinates we’re all organized and will to work together with problems arises. Well managed team equaled a well managed market place.
good,"greet customers, help them with their findings of items they are searching for. I feel the most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers.  The hardest part of the job is recovery. putting items back into the aisle they belong."
good,A great learning experience and requires you to perform tasks outside of your job description. Tasks performed are not very demanding and the environment is typically easy going and a is good first job for teens.
good,"Great place to work "
good,i liked the customers so much they were so respectful they loved me too i never get any complaints they always have converstations  with me  they never really had a problem
good,Good for getting cashier experience.. but a high turn over for managers and cashiers. Low pay. High - pace fun job. Part -time is only limited to 16 hrs.
good,Great work place nice people friendly envirorment nice workplace peacable place great deals great supervisors an co workers supervisors will work with you .
good,"Communication issues, management had safety discrepancies. Alot of different situations that could of handled more professional. It was much better my first nine months than the later time I was employed"
good,"There's workplace drama, schedules are unstable, a lot of stocking/ organisation. Tends to get busy every holiday& graduation time. Not horrible to work there, but it can get very stressful"
good,It was a very fun place to work. It was a temporary job to redo the store and we worked overnight . The team we had were very nice and managment worked for dollar tree and were very nice and made it a fun experience.  If they ever do another redo at a store by me I would do it again.
good,Dollar tree gave me a chance when no one else did. Definitely think they made me the best manager I could be right now. Of course there's room for improvement
good,Fun and easy going place to work. Most managers and employees are friendly and helpful. Cashier and stocking pisitions available. Almost everyone is a cashier at one point or another so customer service is a must. As well as helping customers on the sales floor.
good,"I started as a store manager trainee.  They have a great training program to set you up for success when you are assigned to a store.  Plus, the district managers are very helpful."
good,"Great place to work, but not much hours given to associate. 5 hours with 3-4 days wasn't enough with over staffing especially with living in New York."
good,I worked the evening shift as a cashier. My job for me was good but the store otherwise needed plenty of help. It was always 2 or 3 people closing the store at night. We always had lines because we didn't have the help or people called out. But I didn't worry about that. I loved cashiering and I always kept my line down. I would still be working if they would have worked with me about the schedule.
good,My typical day at work I would go in punch in go count my til or start on isle one with recovery.There wasn't any hard part about this job.My most enjoyable part of the job is when we were closing I would clean up the store and it would look nice
good,"good place to work ….I am the manager"
good,I had a good experience with the dollar tree distribution center I left because of scheduling conflicts but over all a great place to work competitive pay and employee recognition
good,Dollar Tree was a decent place to work.  The hours required as manager can be horrible.  If you live in a town that has a good workforce then it isn't as bad.
good,I would come to clock in and get my drawer and go to my register. I would scan items and handle transaction with the customers. When there are no customers at check out I would make sure my station is clean and stocked.
good,the dollar store is a pretty busy store. each cashier averages 80+ customers per shift which is five hours. Each cashier is also assigned side jobs to do *if* there is down time
good,"This place is a good start and great atmosphere... at first. As long as you stick to yourself, you should do fine. But beware, any property damage (such as to your vehicle in their parking lot with working cameras) will be on you."
good,"dollar tree was my first retail job. at first, I didn't know what to expect from a job like that but I went in with a good attitude and a willingness to work and it did me well. Over the 4 plus years that I have worked for the company, the management has been great and are willing to work with my school schedule and other jobs that I have taken on as well."
good,"Great work for college students. That have to go to school and work part time.Also for people that have alot of time in their hands and whats to go in a part time and love to be in the retail,customer service industry."
good,"-My Typical day at work would consist of keeping the stores nice and clean by picking up any products off the floor and placing them back on the shelves, attending to any customer who had questions or concerns about products in the store, I'd work the cash register, and restocking any products that were low in inventory."
good,The job doesn't have enough hours or pay. It would be a good job to people if they didn't pay so little.. People have family and 9.00 an hour is not enough  pay for familys. I have three girls so I need to make at least 11 dollars an hour
good,"very pleasant place to work and improve communication skills."
good,I usually spend most of my time on the register. I deal with customers and their purchases. I also work on stocking and cleaning up ailses to give customers a great experience.
good,"Its ok to make a little money till something more prof comes along, just to pay the bills.  "
good,"Listen it's a warehouse job it's tough hot dirty and not fun, but it's pay is better than most warehouse. You get free insurance, you get PTO and they are always in need of people for overtime. The down fall is management the gm agm and HR manager are terrible. If they took those three people and replaced them it would be a great place."
good,"If you need low prices for items most everyone uses its a great place to work for while looking to up-build your resume, skills, and dream, education."
good,Dollar tree was my first job and it really helped with gaining customer service experience. Fast paced environment that challenged day to day skills and encouraged an outgoing personality when interacting with customers.
good,"At work, I would usually work the register. Occasionally I would help with fixing up the front of the store and putting items out on the registers if no one was buying anything. If I was a back up cashier, I would work on returning items to the correct aisles or just reorganizing the items already out."
good,It works. They hire a lot of people then the people leave it was a never ending cycle of having hours then no hours. The customers were shoddy though.
good,"Long hours, learned how to be more social, clean environment, and the most enjoyable part of working there was being social and working together as a team."
good,Loved the work that I did their got alone with all my co works and stocking and running the register was a good experience got to know how to deal with rude customers at dollar tree
good,Dollar Tree is a good work environment with consistent work. At times there were employees that had problems with each other that I was able to solve. Other than that Dollar Tree is a great environment to work in.
good,"I learned the basics of managing a store. Overall I had a pretty good experience, but it did definitely had it's rough moments. Example being that we had our air conditioners break down and no matter how many times we informed the mangers and technicians, they did nothing to help us until a month later. The head management was the biggest issue. The store managers were great though, we worked entirely as a team and it was due to our teamwork we were one of the most successful stores in the region."
good,"I've learned how to work with a cash register, "
good,"good place to work, management needs to care for their employees .they need to give equal hours to each employee no favorites "
good,"The days are always hectic and most of the upper management do not know what it actually takes to run the store on a daily basis. District managers do not know the proper terminology for the reports that are done on a daily basis. They don't even know how to properly file an accident report. Some lack the interpersonal skills to actually have conversations that give the employee constructive criticism and the confidence that they can do the job. "
good,"There is always something to do. Someone always needs help. Something always needs to be stocked. Something always needz to be cleaned. The job is repetitive, but fast. Easy if you know it"
good,"Stocks shelves "
good,"Management is great, you learn a lot of things working with the store manager."
good,"I worked at Dollar Tree for a couple of months in order to earn some extra money. It was a good place to work as a cashier for the first time, and I enjoyed my time there."
good,it was some kind of work life I got used for more then what I got paid for it was as if then didn't care bout the fact of over working there employees
good,My typical day at work has me as the main cashier and nine times out of ten I never have time to get anything else done except being on the register and helping customers. I learned a lot in my time working for Dollar Tree as it has been my first job. Management is nice but at times the managers do not communicate with each other.
good,"So a typical day at Dollar Tree is pretty slow, it normally gets busy within the last 2 hours of the work day. On my first few days a manager stood by me while on the register until they were certain I understood the basics of the register. I'd say the hardest part of the job was when its just you and the manager on duty and they go to lunch so you have to handle the store all on your own for 30  minutes."
good,"A typical day at work consists of almost entirely being stuck at the register helping customers cash out. I have learned what it was like to be behind the counter and having to handle the pressure of multiple people with multiple items at any given time. The management is one of the best, they are always ready to help, however, they too often get swamped with people or outside business issues general employees don't get to know about. The hardest part of the job happens to be cashing people out and making sure everybody gets the correct change or has enough to purchase their items while also having to finish the tasks requested by the store manager at the same time. The most fun is when people bring in their kids and the kids ask questions or bring light into the room."
good,Management could be better/worse depending on the manager in duty. The most stressful thing about this place is that some coworkers don’t clean up after themselves and the managers don’t say anything to them.
good,Very Good Spot Quick And Easy Alot Of Standing Some Dollar Trees Are Very Nasty Dirty The Management Could Be Better You Also Stock The Shelves Open Boxes And Put The Item Up
good,"It was fun working here. Customers were always so nice and understanding. Management was really nice as well and really responsible. Hours could be given more but other than that, it was a nice experience"
good,The store has great items for great prices is Stila is in a good area and have great customers the store have name brand items for a dollar and that's a great thing
good,"I started working at Dollar Tree after I had just moved to CO a few months after I graduated from high school. I enjoyed working there for the most part, the shifts were never very long, and I always got a 10 minute break whenever I worked. I got called in pretty often, and I almost never missed the opportunity to work extra hours. I also used my good customer service skills to help people find whatever they needed, and to chat with the customers that came through my line. I really enjoyed working for Dollar Tree, the managers treated me very well, and they were very nice to me, and they were flexible when I started going to school and I got a full time job, and I could not work as much as I had previously, or when I was a little late because of the traffic in that area, and going straight from my full time job to the Dollar Tree store, which usually took about a half hour, but one time it took almost 2 hours because the traffic was really bad."
good,It’s been a good experience to be in. The workers I’ve met are easy to get along with. The manager’s strict but she’s always working including days of
good,I liked everything about Dollar Tree except the distance of the paychecks. You are already at minimum wage you should at least get payed every week. It makes it to where you have no money for a whole week and people need that money for food gas and other essential stuff like that. Other than that my experience was a good one.
good,"Every day is different, I am always busy with something such as stocking shelves, resetting displays, answering customer's questions, helping customers find items. "
good,"Dollar tree was a good fair company, I work there while caregiving for my passing father, I would had loved it though my production manager job was given away after been told it was for me, but during my absence w my father funeral, my DM  gave my job away my store manager told was waiting for me so my DM costed me a full-time position which I would still be at however I enjoyed my time there other than that."
good,wish I could go back to work but they have no hours. I loved working there. The staff was great. Manager great. Just wish I could go back soon even just to stock. Can do it all even be in management.
good,"I didn't working at this job but I couldn't stay working at retail forever. The management was great, I didn't have a problem with them. The hours were horrible but it's retail so can't expect much."
good,the atmosphere in this work place is amazing. everyone got along even in the most hectic of times during the holidays. amazing staff and exceptional customer service from everyone
good,The hours are crazy and people walk out the store taling things unpaid for with them due to their not being enough staff. It was crazy only given out the schedule every Sunday for the upcoming week makes it hard when you have a family to run...
good,Customers were very friendly and patient. Other employees were great communicators and very alert and proficient with any complaints a customer may have. Company was good ty o work for just didnt provide enough hours for an individual to completely provide for themselves.
good,It was a good job but not enough hours provided. It was a part time job & they were serious about having days off. The people & manager that i use to work with were good employees.
good,"Dollar Tree is store where you can find pretty much most of the things that are need it for home like napkins, brooms, mops, bathroom utilities and much more like party supplies and toys for the children house decorations and cleaning supplies. There is a lot of regular customers and employees work like in family, friendly workers and customers too."
good,"It was fun fast pace you learn a lot from stocking to cashier to unloading the truck , you learn something different every day , fun environment always in a great happy mood"
good,"the store to shop where every thing is a dollar.The customers are very satisfied to know they  can find groceries  as well. the location is surrounded by schools, churches and courts."
good,"I loved my job there...  There is always work to do, fun people I worked with.  We always had a variety of different and new items that came in.  You were able to learn to get to know your customers personally.."
good,My experience at Dollar Tree was not bad however I do feel like they let me go because of a disability and some customer complaints about that disability which too bad. Overall a good working experience.
good,typical day started with counting down safe and register then getting game plan ready for team. Workplace culture was good. Hardest part of job was unloading truck. Very time consuming. Most enjoyable part was the people in the environment.
good,"In the management role, there was extremely high expectations, and low appreciation.  Many things are unable to be delegated to others, making the management role a bit difficult.  Due to company policies, there are many things that will only be put on the management, and during busier shifts, they would have to be put off to the next day or shift, making you feel like you were not able to complete your personal responsibilities for that day.  On other days, when there was not such a high demand for the management to be active in the cashier shifts, you were able to complete all required tasks, and you would leave the job feeling like you had a great day.  It was just inconsistent, and I personally don't like to feel unproductive at work and like my day is never known as to what it will be like."
good,"Working at the Dollar Tree was one of my most hectic work experiences. While it's a great place for your buck as a customer, it's a roller coaster as an employee. It's a very fast paced job when you must cover cashier, stocking and cleaning while answering customers questions all at once while other employees aren't putting in the same amount of energy that you are, it's overwhelming. While working in a place like the Dollar Tree you must remember your main goal it's very easy to get frustrated at a place like this. Although i enjoyed myself most of the time i have to say there were days that i just wanted to scream to the top of my lungs and just leave. Management was awful. It was a crazy house. Would I work there again? Yes i would. For i feel that i have grown in a way not to let others steal my joy."
good,"It was a great place to work with great people, but sometimes the customers made you want to go crazy with questions like ""How much is this?"" ""Its a dollar, you're at the Dollar Tree"""
good,Great people to work with but very hard to keep up with the job. Always having to improve and be fast making it stressful all the time to me it was hard but for someone else it could be what they like
good,I was promoted twice. The compensation is very poor and is not enough to pay for my living expenses. Nice people but not worth it. No benefits for asm managers.
good,I've been working at dollar tree for almost two year now and I've had a great experience with this job. learning many different skill sets and enjoying the environment that is provided by this company.
good,"I Loved my job at dollar tree. It was fast paced and the time flew by really fast because we were always so busy. I wouldn't mind going back to work there as a second job,"
good,I am literally only writing this because apparently I can't get my other job applications submitted without giving a review on my place of work. Look. It's a dollar store. You get what you get. Easy enough job. Butt pay. Is what it is baby.
good,"a typical work day is usually busy, lots of people shop there so the lines are long. "
good,"Dollar Tree was a good, friendly environment to work in.  Good Management and coworkers.  I got a long well with the manager and coworkers.  They were very accommodating to my personal life."
good,"I worked as a cashier and as a stock associate at dollar tree. Cashiering was a simple process, as was counting and dropping the till before and after shift. Stocking was a bit more difficult because the merchandise is always changing from the company purchaseing whole sale shipment containers with who knows what inside, aside from their permanent brand contracts. The truck hours would change and vary each week but there i always between 1500-2500 items of freight to be unloaded and categorized to specific u-boats per aisle and section. The truck is unloaded by hand unless it is already on a pallet like the frozen food section. After separating freight, we would begin stocking the aisles with it and then break down the boxes for recycling. It can be incredibly and physically taxing, especially when one or two stock associates don't show up for their shift and the truck needs to be unloaded either way within 2 hours maximum. The store manager was a great guy so I will certainly give credit where its due."
good,While management did a great job the company overall failed with lacked of advancement being as you could only apply as part time unless it was for a management position. The coworkers were friendly and helpful and if you lacked in one area they helped you build it up. The atmosphere was lovely and inviting while still having a serious tone to it.
good,"I enjoyed working there the manager and asst. Manager""s were great to work for they were very easy going and very helpful. The stocking part of the job is very easy and the unloading of the supply trucks is not bad either,"
good,Dollar tree was a place of good setting when i worked there. my co- workers were fun and very outgoing. i did not like unloading the truck so much but it was do-able.
good,Working at the Dollar Tree enhances my customer service experience. I am calm under stressful situations. The environment is fast paced and very demanding from the customers but I am able to face and conquer them.
good,dollar something Bieber Summer The People The Weather For what can be friendly and can be mean besides that There is a wonderful Place to Shop free prices
good,it was a great job in the beginning then things got rocky after my injury and i feel at that point i lost the support of both the store manager and the district manager as if i caused this injury purposely or something
good,Dollar Tree was actually not a bad place to work if you don't have children. The management didn't really pay attention to issues at the stores which resulted in not enough workers and working women on the hottest days unloading trucks. Management also never showed up for work.
good,Very welcoming and understanding to new employees. I was scheduled to work but was never informed about it. I am hoping that isn’t an ongoing problem.
good,"It seems like Dollar tree doesn't like to hire enough workers. Sometimes there be overloads of work and not enough time. If I have to work hard for only 1500 a month which after taxes I really only get 1200, then I need to be compensated more."
good,I enjoyed my employees and customers!  I started out as a stocker but within a few short months became a part time manager.  After about two months became full time freight management.
good,"Working at dollar tree is a great start for your first job. I started as cashier, which was fun but I wanted to do more around the store so I became a stocker for the early morning. I love stocking up new merchandise and being able to keep up with my aisles, making sure everything is in it's rightful place. The hardest part is not being able to finish the task due to many customers needing assistance, which is fine cause I'm still working and moving around. Overall it's a fun experience at dollar tree."
good,"I really enjoyed my time at dollar tree. For the most part, the days went by quickly as there was enough work to do, but not so much that it was overwhelming. My managers and coworkers, in general, were awesome, and most of the customers at my location were very pleasant. I would have probably stayed there longer if it weren't for how little you are paid, and lack of opportunity to change that."
good,I learned a lot the time I was there I got to do price changes and go backs and stocking and keeping the floor cleaning and clear at all times be nice to the customer and try to make every one happy and assist any customer that needs help
good,"Dollar tree was always packed, specially Saturdays when the news paper was delivered. the a/c a the place i was working dint work all that much, the mangers were really cool and flexible with my hours."
good,"They did not really do anything for employees, had to make deposit on my dime, my gas, my vehicle wear. It was a fun Job for me because it waa totally different than what I do during day, more laid back."
good,It was a nice job that I would have been willing to stay on full time. However it was only a temporary position for the holidays during the Christmas season.
good,"With tasks as simple as stocking and cleaning, Dollar Tree was a great first real job. There are no real skills required besides customer service. The customers can really make your day much more difficult, but it's nothing that can't be handled. If you have great math fundamentals, the job just gets that much more simple in terms of being a cashier and working with money. Even if you don't, the registers do most of the work for you anyway. Highly recommended as a first job for teenagers or young adults."
good,Great place to go for a first time job in retail if that is the field you like fairly easy to do for the pay given to employees. Simple work loads holidays can be hectic.
good,"A typical day at work would be your on your register with another employee who is on the sales floor and they are your backup just in case things get busy. Sometimes you switch positions. There were four managers and they were all great managers who made sure you never lose sight on what your task is for the day. The hardest part of the job would be midday and the weekends, also when it becomes close to the holidays. The most enjoyable part of the job was all the friends you make."
good,"Start of work day would consist of opening the store, counting the tills, and working freight. Once store was open, attention was given to customer service as well as freight."
good,"Management needs some improvement."
good,"Fun and fast paced. "
good,Headcount is at a minimum.  They do as much with as few as possible.  Be prepared to work long hours.  Decent benefits but compensation is behind other industries in the area.
good,I did nothing special just was a chasier and stock sometimes. It was pretty fast paced with so many customers but was a good job. Sometimes was a little to packed but a job is a job.
good,"A day at work is long or short on some days, but it's not hard work, and sometimes past by quickly. It's a fast pace job, and I learned you have to be patience with your customers."
good,"When I use to work there as a cashier, the working environment was relaxing because the work there was easy although their pay wasn't by paying me $7.25/hr."
good,"With a few exceptions, my time at Dollar Tree was a very positive experience. I was given a schedule that med my needs, for the most part management was very approachable, and everyone was treated equally."
good,"Cashier in charge of stocking shelves, scanning products for purchase, helping customers with item location. Relaxed job. and enjoy helping costomers."
good,If the store isnt to busy it is ok but once you get really busy there is usually only one register open. You have to call the manager to help.  Not everyone is pleasant to you.
good,"Dollar Tree offers a family like work environment. Co workers were  very helpful in training me as well as patient.The work hours offered to me were few however and at a pay rate under $10 an hour,doing the math I discovered that I spent most of my pay getting to work."
good,"I enjoyed working here. I met so many good people. My work crew was the best and management was the best as well.  Treated well. Treated fair.  It was fast-paced. Set-up seasonal displays, constantly moving. Opened. Worked mid-shift. Closing. Trained new employees."
good,I love working for Dollar tree but the head man just keep cutting hours. For what I don't know. I think the head manager needs to cone to the store more often and stop cutting hours because the employees who does part time we need work.
good,Great store manager and co-workers for the most part. But they do not pay there employees enough at all. There is a lot required to get done in a short amount of time with little pay.
good,"On a typical day at work i usually clocked in and started on an aisle that my manager told me to do. I learned patience with customers and with myself. The hardest part of the job was truck day, because it was fast pace with heavy boxes. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people at Dollar Tree, they're very nice and very funny."
good,"A typical day at work includes unloading boxes off of trucks , stacking product on its appropriate aisle ,cashier ,and greeter"
good,The management for Dollar Tree was very welcoming and kind to me during my first few weeks of being employed. It was a simple job that wasn't too stressful and allowed me to work at my own pace.
good,"Managers were treated like stockers for this company.  Most stores were understaffed and over worked,  I do not believe the  sales goals were realistic."
good,"Shifts are typically 4 1/2 hours, with 3-5 shifts per week. The work is fairly low-intensity, and doesn't have the soul-sucking quality that so many minimum wage jobs do. The in-store management was pretty good at my location, though regional and above seemed to be quite lacking."
good,Rewarding job as long as you put effort forward and are willing to over come situation.Not every store is the same but when you find one you flow with you can go along way.
good,Everyone is part time you have to work the shift they give you. Personally im tired of working nights can't have days till someone quits I don't see myself going any where
good,Overall being a cashier at dollar tree is fairly simple. It's a rather relaxed atmosphere with its few busy times. Although there isn't much room for advancement nor is there quality benefits involved its a decent starter job for anyone needing to gain experience in the field.
good,"Good company to work for. Long hours, you are more of a stocker and back up cashier than a manager. You can potentially bonus, if you have a good crew than store can be managed by itself."
good,it was ok i did like working there and the pay was pretty decent. I would definitely go back to work for the company if asked too. The manager is actually really sweet.
good,This company overall is not bad to work for. It can be very stressful. The only downfall to this store is that they expect every employee to run a cash register as well as stock the shelves at the same time which can be nearly impossible.
good,"It's A Good Place To Be.  This Was My First Job In The Rochester, Mn Area.  Manager Is Motivated & Inspiring,  Co-Workers Are Respectful & Helpful On The Job."
good,This is a great place to work if your looking for part time and flexibility. They work well with family and things that happen to come into play with life.
good,Overall solid company.  Would recommend to others.  Advancement opportunities available to someone who applies themselves. Good training programs in place.
good,"Dollar tree was stressful during holidays and was very hard to deal with customers that got angry over only one line being open. I enjoyed the workplace, it was very fast paced and always had customers"
good,I have worked at 4 Dollar tree they are all unique. Every store has been different. At every dollar tree it is a mission.l to make customers happy. We put out our stock and clean the store to almost looking new.
good,I enjoyed working at dollar tree in a sense it was extremely easy.  The staff i worked with was very respectful. The manager was also very flexible. However was a life career for me.
good,I've never had a problem with the store they've always been fairly kind and fair to me and I do recommend it to anyone wanting to apply and possibly further their career in the company.
good,"My honest review for my preview job, Dollar Tree, would have to be that there should be more questions involved before you end the summary because you need to know more on why workers are into the job positions."
good,I like working for them just was hard sometime to have a chid at home and work 40 hours and felt i was missing out on to much of that being up there all the time.
good,"From controlling payroll,taking care of all the paper work in the office taking care of cash outs for each employee at the end of there shifts and taking deposits to the bank. Stocking all the shelves unloading trucks making sure all change over are done correctly and on time."
good,"In all dollar tree is not a bad place.  Very busy during the holidays., Could keep the cooler for drinks stocked better.  Also new things for the older generation should be purchased."
good,I enjoyed working at the dollar tree cause the management was very sure of what they were doing and everyone would help if you needed help. While the job itself was pretty hard when we got busy I never felt like I was all alone.
good,So the hours were good. But I did leave to relocate stores . The manager's we're very helpful. They chose easy steps for me to learn the shortly cashiering.
good,.Cashier position was easy and fast paced busy till shift is over. Having customer service skills a positive thing to have in sales.  Team members at my location  worked together as a team to get this accomplished
good,"Dollar Tree is a decent place to work, nothing special. Though I may be biased because my location does not have the budget to give me more hours, so I wouldn't be able to give an accurate description."
good,This is a good job for someone who is just starting out and needs experience. Retail is difficult but the challenge was good. I enjoyed the more laborous parts of this job over the retail aspect.
good,Decent place to work no benefits is the downside and not enough hours pay could be better but it's a decent entry level job for someone just starting out
good,Great job for a 18 year old high school student not if you're older than 30. Pay sucks.Dollar tree as a store in general is a great idea but working there sucks.
good,This is a job for people to get up on there feet and get some money. I liked it for the time of being there got along with every coworker there and it went well.
good,"Dollar Tree has many loyal employees who have been with the company for a long time. Compensation is fair. The workplace culture is amicable. Management structures are a bit awkward, but they try to run a very lean, process-driven operation."
good,it was a wonderful place to work as long as Communication was consistant. I started working at a new location and Management was wonderful. Store manager cared about her employees and always went down to their level to assist and teach the. Unfortunately  things happened and management changed and the location fell apart. Tried to work at the Nashua location and management was inconstant Agreed to one schedule and continuously tried to force something i was unable to do from the beginning. Lower management spoke behind peoples back and made fun of employees with disability. Depending on the location you work in really depends on the environment.
good,Over all good place to work. I learned working in the trailer  there being an asthmatic I need more clothing. Management there I founded their open to suggestion.
good,Dealing with customers not knowing the policy of returns. Deal with them the best you can. Management is a hit and miss. It can be a pain to try nad get days off if no one is willing to work for you. Telling people you are out of a product and they don't believe you.
good,"The job is very easy to pick-up. As a cashier, the basic responsibilities was to be at the cash register. When they are no customers, you have to clean up your work space."
good,"It was a decent place to work, there was always something to do, around the Holidays it was hard to keep up, everything was out of place and you had to work holidays, it was very stressful during those times"
good,"great place to work"
good,"Would have loved to return to the Dollar Tree after graduation part-time until I could find a better career job. Dollar Tree is a great slow-paced working environment and an easy to learn the job that required little effort. I recommend this job to homeless folk, high schoolers, and anyone who needs a quick easy job that pays little but just enough to feed one person on."
good,My experience with dollar tree wasn't bad. If I gotten more hours and it wasn't bi-weekly I would've stood. It gets really busy and packed but its a great customer service job.
good,I enjoyed working at the Dollar Tree. There were fast and slow days. this. Management communicated well and was understanding. I enjoyed meeting new people.
good,"This was a place to get my feet planted in the working world so I could advance somewhere else. I didn't mind working there except the pay was very low and I rarely got any hours. (At the most, I received 12 hours a week.)"
good,I enjoyed my crew and coworkers. i feel we shared a great chemistry with one another and i also admired my regulars. They also enjoyed my service towards them.
good,"I was a cashier in a very busy work environment, with lines of waiting customers.  I was responsible for balancing my till at the end of each shift, as well as counting monies correctly to each customer, using a touch screen register, and a credit card machine."
good,"This job would be a great first job for someone to gain experience. You get to know your coworkers, and learn different skills. Some days, especially near holidays, the store would become very crowded and fast pace. On a normal day, you could get your work done and just have fun with it. You get to meet regulars in the store and it helps with keeping positive and attracting new people to come in."
good,"Dollar tree was actually a really good place to work can be hard on some people because of the pace of work, can make decent money here if you actually stick it out and work things out with the store manager/district manager"
good,"as a former employee, I enjoyed working here. this is actually one of the only places ive worked that I wouldn't mind going back to. it was fast paced active but at the same time very organized. if the manager called me for a job I would show up to work with a smile on my face."
good,wasnt a bad place to work at it is retail so remember that when getting a job at a retail place. if you need a job and willing to work they will hire you
good,"Fun place , great co-workers "
good,Working with the staff is a great experience and as well as some of the people I've met from head office. It was a great experience to be able to be promoted within the company twice.
good,Is a friendly work place.it was very helpful as a part time job with 4 hours shifts and great managment.Also the customers and atmosphere  are very easy to work in.
good,working hard in a hot truck supervisors are somewhat strict on you especially if you miss one day of work unloading trucks and then wrapping the pallets and then lining up and labeling your work
good,"stock is everything, get about 1600 boxes a week and wants to try to get everything out asap. hours are good for managers but associates get upto 20 hours a week so keeping a good staff is hard"
good,My position is as a Cashier but I also help stock shelves and unload the delivery truck when necessary. I enjoy my work and the people I work with. Our customers are great and I see many of the same faces so I get to know them.
good,"Not a horrible job, just no room for advancement."
good,I love to work at Dollar Tree just bad management from The district manager but other than that its a great job and very fun to work at and is a stable job and can move up
good,I would recommend this job to people just starting out in the work feikd because it is easy to catch on to and pretty relaxed.i think this job helped me understand more about the retail business and I learned how to be a better employee
good,"Dont mind the work, cant pay a single bill at 7.35 unloading 18wheelers. I have no complaints about working inside of dollar tree. I would like a better pay due to my ability to work with my team through all obstacles... I Complete my task in an orderly manner, make my store look good, my dollar tree team looks good...( GREAT TEAM)"
good,"a day at dollar tree is always full with something to do to make the store look better, stay stocked and even make the day fly by before you know it. This job is not that mentally demanding and you know your job when you first start here"
good,Working at dollar tree is fun and your always busy. The good thing about management is that they are so willing to help in whatever you need help in . Their goal is for you to keep growing and moving up in positions
good,"a typical day at work is Clean floor, assist customers with questions  and stock items.  I never assist customers before I learn something new. This is all I do there."
good,"The pay is low and they aren't very flexible with work hours, I was only employed there for a short amount of time, no career advancement which is what I need."
good,As far as a learning cashier job its not too difficult. Employees and management are helpful and will to help you learn. Pace varies by day and time. Work schedule is 2 to 3 days only unless full time then its near 32 hours.
good,Pretty good for a starter job. Easy to learn and fast days .management is great and works aroynd your school schedule. Hours are good depending in your position.
good,Friendly environment Customer Service  are use all the time Flexible in hours but Associates hours are limited to certain amount I enjoy my new manager Shes fair.I still new a better paying job I have acquired a new skill and that would be cashiering The store requires restocking  products back to the shelves I met the General Manager and she was nice and knowledgeable  The store I work at carry alot of material
good,"I did a part time."
good,"Everything comes in freight boxes, Unloading truck and stocking shelves and making end caps for the end display of the isle. Was a good part time job."
good,Dollar Tree can be an fun place to work depending on upper management. I really do not have muc to say  I worked for Dollar Tree for 15 years and have been both a Store Manager and an assistant manager. I have both enjoyed it and hated it..
good,Working at dollar tree was great at first but I honestly felt things could of been better like giving me more hours and less gossip about people or other employers
good,There was no personal growth for the company for where I could achieve my goals in the current location. The company should give rewards and personal gains for the employees.
good,"As a cashier you are not only responsible for checking out customers, but also stocking, merchandising, providing customer service and assistance.  They would like to hire people at minimum wage and part time which is impossible to live on.  I will say that management is friendly, helpful, and understanding sometimes to a fault that they allow people to call in all the time, no call/no show yet still have a job.  There is a high turn over rate.  It is a great place to work as far as co-workers are friendly and the customers for the most part are very nice.  I enjoy being busy so cashiering, stocking, as well as any miscellaneous jobs.  Pay should be better, they should hire the good people and allow incentives to advance as well as provide incentive to stay."
good,"It's a regular retail job, I have no complaints. There are very few rude people that come in to the store. There are no benefits for part time workers but if you want to be a manager you will get them."
good,"Me as a cashier that's been working with the company for almost a year is such a wonderful thing that ever happened, it's very simple and enjoyable to anyone who wants to work for the company."
good,the staff was basically my work family
good,"Slow paced, enjoyed working with customers and learning new things to improve customer satisfaction with shopping experience.  Hardest part was unloading truck on delivery days that is the main time it was more fast paced."
good,i get there check in then call for a manger. we then get my drawer ready and i go to my assigned till and log in and then turn my light on and start to help costumers. after about 2 hours I get a 10 minute break. plus between costumers i clean around the till area. then when its time for me to get off. i sign off and the me and a manger go to the office to count till and put money away. i then go and check out for the day and leave.
good,Center Street Dollar Tree in Auburn provides a good work environment. The stroe manager is great to work with. Work can be fast paced at times. Depending on your availability to work only in their block scheduling will determine the hours you receive.
good,"Lots of customers, always at registers, or putting away inventory. They definatley dont pay the cashiers enough. Also, they should offer everyone full time, benefits, and full time hours."
good,"the night went fast, management she was ok I did make the best of it. there was a lot. of standing on your feet but was part of the job. When the night was over you chould take a look at your work and say I did good, that was the best part."
good,They need to care more for the employees at the store level. Give out more than up to .25 a year. Health insurance is super high for family plans. Reduce the amount of freight shipped to stores.
good,My coworkers made my job enjoyable. Everyone was very hard working and did everything with a smile. Not saying we didn't have rough days but for the most part we was one big happy family.
good,"My job at dollar tree was as a cashier but i also had the oportunity to do some other things like learn how to stock and to help customer "
good,Typical day consisted of receiving merchandise of the delivery truck and stocking merchandise.  Hardest part of the job was the manager not always clear on what they wanted as far as stocking merchandise.  Most enjoyable was the customers that we were able to meet.
good,fast paced busy environment with large turn over. Long hours at times but with the right people youu can have fun and get the store to the point of profit
good,The Dollar Tree is a fun place to work. There is always something to do and the managers are very easy to work with. The work pace is dependent on the time of year and time of day. The hardest part of the job is being on your feet.The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with the customers and helping make their day better.
good,"I either opened the store or closed the store doing cash in and cash out. I worked in the back with the freight deliveries and stocking the shelves. I was able to work in a comfortable environment with a great team until new management came in and made unreasonable demands. I was very good at my job and enjoyed it."
good,"Dollar tree was a overall decent place to work. they had mandatory breaks that you had to take, hours were very flexible. I would recommend dollar tree as a good place for a first job in retail."
good,"There was lack of positive direction, lack of training on time, protocols not always follow.  Most of all lack or NO communication with staff."
good,Fun to work with and help customers. Everything is a dollar! Gives you new things to do for job tasks. Can level up to manager if you do well as a cashier and willing to learn new things and show up to work. Must follow rules to go up on the toteum pole!
good,open the store for the daily functions of the store. checked in vendors and trucks. unloaded trucks and stocked shelves. Assisted customers with their needs. maintained a clean atmosphere for the employees and workers.
good,"I was hired as a stocker. did not get the position until the end of my employment. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping the customer and stocking the shelves, I knew where everything was in the store"
good,I spent 4 years with Dollar Tree and it fulfilled my career goal of managing a big box store. The management was fantastic and my coworkers were awesome.
good,"Worked place is relaxed normally calm enviorment alot of traffic.work fast to get shipments in, then unload shipments and get all shelves stocked because things sell pretty quick"
good,"It is an okay place to work. emloyees need to be a little more dependable, however, its a nice place to work. I would recommend it to anyone as long as they can handle sometimes strict stocking goals."
good,This was my first retail job. Everything was very simple and straightforward. A typical day included cashiering and store recovery. Management was always a pleasure to deal with.
good,This was a very interesting place to work.  This is when I first took an interest in stocking shelves.  This was a very productive store.  The store as had a lot of customers.
good,"A typical day at work consists of me greeting customers and getting things done around the store along with cashiering. I have learned how to better pace myself. The store manager is great. The overall workplace is decent. I wouldn't say there is a hard part to the job. Whatever needs to get done, I make sure it does, if I have concerns I make sure to address them with management. Most enjoyable part is talking with the customers."
good,I personally absolutely love Dollar Tree. Lots of new items coming out and a lot of the old one still there. Staffing is awesome and helpful. Always going there spending more than I should
good,Every shift starts with a clear written goal sheet of what job I will be performing that day and goals that should be met for that day.  It is a relaxed environment that moved at a very shift pace.  The job stresses the importance of customer service and thriving to achieve the best possible outcomes.
good,Good work place i liked working here although its fast paced management has always been great to me. In a job like this you have to be able to keep up but also have fun
good,Can be a bit stressful but a relaxed workplace. Manager was nice and hard working. Staff was always short but it provided us with more hours. Pleasant experience.
good,In this Fallon store it was a nice atmosphere to work in. The coworkers work well with each other. The management is willing to work with you on your schedule.
good,began as a wonderful place to work. I started as a seasonal worker and I proved my self dependable enough to be chosen to stay on after the season. The first few years were good then I had been passed over for two promotions that went to two females which I had more seniority and experience than. Every time I inquired as to why I didn't get the promotion I would get excuse after excuse none of them valid
good,"A typical day at work consisted of being prepared to make sales by promoting the store and keeping the store clean. Presenting yourself well in front of others shows great customer service and help assist anyone who needs help. Though, sometimes the hardest part of the job is maintaining cleanliness and keeping the cashier lines short. But having a great team to help out and finish the job at the end of the day."
good,the job is extremely fast paced and can seem very overwhelming at times. You must be quick on your feet and a fast thinker. I would have continued to work at dollar tree if it wasn't for lack of leadership from the store manager.
good,dollar tree deal was one of the most chill jobs i ever had there not much bad things to say about dollar tree as long you doing your job you will be good
good,"Great place to work, very friendly staff."
good,"Dollar tree is a good place to work, the management is nice they work with u if u need more hours and if u need to change your schedule they work with you. when the holiday come up they will do something or let u wear a shirt or the color for that day."
good,The managers were all very helpful and willing to teach me what I didn't know. Most of the time I either worked at the cashier or did recovery of the store (cleaned up). The hours are inconsistent and are not decided by the individual but rather a computer program. Makes it a bit difficult to have more than one job.
good,Most times it's a great day. Sometimes it's not so good when you are busy and have a shoplifter. Most of the time customers are patient and kind. During the holidays they need to have several more people working every evening especially a couple in the morn not counting management or stockers
good,"I have not had any problems working at the Dollar Tree .I would love to go back, because it was in my area and I miss working.I looking for a job now."
good,"Easy place to work, need to pay more, give more hours, provide benefits and pay weekly, nice employees, somewhat organized could be a little more, just need more hours to have available to do jobs that need done"
good,Co-workers are friendly but do not want anything to change.  Top management is out of touch with what is going on around them.  They want goals met but don't want to try new things to make it more efficient.
good,It was a fun quiet relaxed place to work.it was stressful at times.the hours weren't enough to continue to work there.Over all it was ok management good
good,"I straightened the store.  I had fun interacting with the customers."
good,I'd work there again...I loved the management...very flexible hours...very relaxed environment...can get hectic during holidays but I found it very interesting...
good,Dollar tree is a nice place to work but employees need more hours. managers have the most hours and they is not much over time provided. 10 minute breaks could be 15.
good,It's a good place to work but I'm at night the homeless come in a mess with you a lot and it's just stressful and scary at times if your alone in the front at night.
good,Hard work if you make it. Gets easy over the years. great employees to work with. Very open to build and gain and learn from there experience. Over all its a good job. You get a raise every year until you retire.
good,This gave me great customer service experience. I loved working here. Managers were very nice and gave me a very flexible schedule. I had a very pleasant experience.
good,"fast place to work at. good people to work with,an everybody is a team player. the help is rite there at the door. they treat people with respect an kindness"
good,"Fast paced and at times stressful. Customers can be bad but most are very nice. Management was ok. Always telling you what to DO and making sure you weren't standing around. Job was casherring,collecting payment,refunds or returns,stocking shelves,breaking down cardboard,filling bags, put carts or baskets away,wipe up spills, use intercom,answer phones, help customers find things,clean doors and Windows,sweep,count drawer at end of shift."
good,"I like working here. It's a fun environment to be around, the people are nice to work with. But I need more hours than are actually given to me. It has a good atmosphere and is normal or average. The pay is also okay for working thee, but not enough hours are given for the hours I need. It's a place that is calming to work but can be a stress job."
good,Ran cash register and stocked shelves. The people were great. Too slow paced. There is just not enough to do to keep busy. I watched the mangers and thought they ran it very smoothly.
good,Very well managed and relaxed work environment. I highly recommend this as a job seeing it is simple and/or if you have a hard time working in heat. Very understanding if you're sick also.
good,Good dependable employment work is easy yet satisfying with many advancement possibility within the company hours are not the best of you are supporting a family. More hours and overtime would help.
good,"I love my job at the Dollar Tree. Always something different. Customers are awesome and challenging too. I love the products we sell. If youre looking for part time, this is the place."
good,"stocking shelves, checking out customers, customer service, cash handling, Hardest part of the job was the language barrier, and the theft, having to kick kids out of the store for stealing"
good,"I swear, a trained chimp, could do this job. It was just ringing customers and that's it. Ring, make change, greet & occasional cleaning of front end."
good,"I was glad I worked there to gain experience.   I gained alot of stock and cash handling,  and customer service experience. I enjoyed working with different people."
good,Very busy cashier position. I had never worked in the retail industry before working with Dollar Tree. It was a very busy job and always kept you busy.
good,"The job was okay, didn't make much money and the management was kind of mean. I always had something to do though. I worked close to every position that there was to work within that building."
good,"I enjoyed working with my fellow employees. I wish the benefits were better. This job was very physical. .. and i enjoyed that. Most of the stocking I did was at night, so the only time I had to deal with customers, was when I ran the cash register during business hours."
good,Typical work day consist of stocking shelves and greeting customers as well assisting them around the store. The hardest part of job was shipment day getting all the shipment off the truck in a timely manner.
good,Very friendly place to obtain money and get to know people. Fun place to work especially around Christmas . Learned a lot of people skills working here how to interact with people . Hardest part of the job was dealing with customers that were not friendly and just letting them get the upper hand because the customer is always right .
good,"no hours no employees "
good,"I enjoyed the different and diverse customers that I had the pleasure of meeting. I learned the different aspects of the company as far as stocking, cashiering."
good,"Cashing out customers, stocking shelves, greeting customers....management is wonderful at local store. Would recommend to anyone!! Just don't pay enough and not enough hours."
good,A typical day consists of stocking and maintaining a fast pace work schedule. Customer service in helping customers with their shopping needs. Cashier and front end assistance.
good,I liked the people i worked with. The job wasn't very physical unless it was truck day. Management were very helpful whenever you had a question about anything. They were pretty easy going. But I wished they let me become a manager.
good,"I did advance quickly from cashier to second assistant manager. I enjoyed this position. The only problem would be the store manager and 1st assistant would call off with very short notice and I would have to get in there to cover their shifts, especially since I lived the closest. But the extra money was always nice in the end."
good,loved this place so much its a place that has it all an i love it because everyone works as one at lease in that store they did it was time taking work but i enjoyed it
good,the place of business is always busy and helps pass the time in your work day. the costumers are pleasant and you get familiar with the regulars who visit.
good,"Dollar Tree is a great place to learn experience in management.There was nothing hard about the job. Just have to be good with people, check quests out quickly, and keep a clean store. Inventory was not hard and hours are pretty regular."
good,"Although there were good opportunities for growth, it was mostly because the management team at the time was so bad. Management would go days without showing up so as an employee I had to advance rather quickly in duties without compensation."
good,Everyone worked together as a team. The shifts were short there fore not leaving enough time to get everything done. It was messy and unorganized but everyone worked together to keep it clesn.
good,I was hired during seasonal. Did not work to long with all extra help that was hired in. Using the register for first time was a challenge for me. Customers were ongoing.
good,I had been with deals for 3 years before they changed to Dollar tree.. fun work place get to work with good co-workers and managers.. always had plenty work to do.
good,"The management compassionately enough hired me on, but I was only able to work one day because he had already hired thirty five other people for the seasonal retail work."
good,"ot can sneak up on you at any moment working here, the managers are all great and on tasked with keeping everyone on the same level of thinking to ensure that the work is done on time"
good,I enjoyed working for Dollar Tree.  It is also a favorite place of mine to shop.  The atmosepher is pleasing and the time flies by when there are a lot of people coming to your register.
good,"Even though it was only seasonal,  the management was very nice and obliging.  Enjoyed working there. The other employees and managers were great to work with."
good,"A typical day at work is relaxing depending on what customers show up that day. It is easy to learn your job. I learned to work cashier, stock, and recovery. Workplace culture is good; I get along with all co-workers and managers. The hardest part of the job is recovery because I have difficulty finding where some items go and sometimes the customers can make the job unpleasant. The most enjoyable part is when a customer is happy after I have checked them out."
good,"Working at Dollar Tree was a great start for finding work. The manager was thorough when teaching me how to do my job, and it was a great experiance to learn how to interact wit customers."
good,"if i wouldnt of just been seasonal help i might of stayed longer it gets pretty crazy there during the holidays and its very annoying that every customer ask ""how much is this"" its a dollar just like everything else in the store there is a sign outside that says ""everythings a dollar"""
good,"A typical work day would be stocking shelves, greeting customers, cleaning the store and running the cash register. I learned how to organize and deal with customers in a fast pace experience. Management was kind, understanding, and helped you through anything you were struggling with. Customers were always kind and talkative. The worst part of the job was the hot building with no air conditioning. Overall the job was great."
good,I learned a lot about being a leader with Dollar Tree. I enjoyed my time there and I will take all my experiences with me throughout my career life. It was truly a great work environment.
good,I have learned alot over my many years of jobs very nice people to work with. loved interacting with customers. be a mangers was very interesting to learn about the company.
good,"Typical day at work includes basic duties. Cleaning, straightening and taking care of customers. Management was a complete joke. Clearly they weren't trained. Needs to be better team lead and family like environment. Easy job, and enjoyable for the most part."
good,"great staff to work with, great environment to work in. Fast pace work days with only working 4 to 5 hour shifts. with being a cashier you also are not aloud to just stand behind register, so there are a lot of things to do through out the day to keep you busy."
good,It was long and boring  poor management. bad communication. Was a very very boring job. the pay was very low. the rules were senseless. we were paid every two weeks
good,"On a daily basis, Cashiers receive payment by cash, check, credit cards, vouchers, or automatic debits. They issue receipts, refunds, credits, or change due to customers."
good,"I enjoyed my job greatly. However, I felt the very-new management put in place (it was a brand new store), were childish; competitive, bickered a lot, and back-bit each other."
good,I feel the hardest part about the job was to make sure that everything was in the correct place even if you didnt know. It wasnt a good trainer/manager she was just plain GHETTO.
good,working at dollar tree was a nice job i had enjoyed . the job was not fast paced but to a minimum pace . the store had to be nice and nest before customers coming in .i enjoyed helping and talking to customers with any items
good,Its ok its an ok working experience. busy work good for college students. good pay good money getting made no problem for spring breaks young people should work here
good,"dollar tree was a fun place to work at, plus you had a chance to meet all types of people , the work it self was just fun i would work there again needed"
good,I enjoy working here  the people are great and i enjoy learning new things. The hours are short 5 hours a day normally 20 to 25 a week get paid 9.00 hour and 10 minute breaks
good,I love The Dollar Tree and all that it has to offer! Such a wide variety of levels to succeed! So much room for advancement and so many wonderful people to call a second family1
good,"Fast learning job, great for a first job if you have no experience. Will always work with your schedule if you can't work one day. Really liked the environment here"
good,Manager was awesome and is still a great friend. I loved cleaning and organizing the store and stocking all the new merchandise.  I just am tired of the swing shifts.
good,"Nice place to start and continue work history, everyone was very polite and made it a great environment to be part of and also learn from. I'm very happy that I can add this to my experience in life."
good,It was great. Didn't like the low hours. Loved the it was a dollar store that everything was a dollar or less. I was able to do my late shopping either on my break or when I got off work.
good,It is a fast paced job. I would recommend it to the younger people in theirs 20s. You either stock the store. Greet the customer. Ring people on the register. There is really no hard part of the job. The management was fine. You do your job and you are fine.
good,"great place to work as a beginner. Short hours unless you prove yourself to be worthy of more, usually only part time great for teenagers or summer break place to work"
good,"A store manager must be able to multitask and function in a fast paced environment."
good,The store was overall nice but the people that worked there were not. And it was just boring work around people who don't like excitement while at work.
good,"Just your average part time job making minimum wage. Great people, learned customer service skills that I will take with my in the future. Boss was friendly and provides references."
good,For a part time job this company is a ever good place to work. I average 25-30 hours a week. I started as a cashier at another location and when I moved I asked to transfer to the closer store.  Without hesitation I was granted the transfer.  My hours are a little different then most because I am in charge of merchandising all the seasonal items so I work mostly in the mornings but when needed and to get extra hours my boss schedules me as a cashier which I appreciate.
good,"Loved my manager. She was a tough lady, but got her job done and was dedicated. Breaks in the back were too short, but you always got a nice christmas card thanking you for your hard work."
good,Worked there for quite a few years throughout school and now in the summer when I am home. I have learned a lot about retail and customer service through working here and it's fun seeing all the new product that comes in every week.
good,"As a first time worker, Dollar Tree was a great way to learn about customer service and money management. Not only is it a great way to meet people, you also learn skills that you can take with you for everyday use and new job opportunities. Being able to communicate well with staff and customers is an important attribute to any success in a workplace environment and provides you the opportunity to learn about compliance and responsibilities on a job."
good,"Dollar Tree is a nice place to work. The enviorment is healthy for their employers. You learn a lot about customer service, how to organize in a timely manor,and how to remain calm in stressful situations. The prices are great!"
good,Working for dollar tree was my first job. I enjoyed working there as a cashier. The staff was very friendly and warm. The management could have been better but overall it was a great experience for my first job
good,I have been with Dollar Tree for over four years and I love my job. There is plenty to learn at Dollar Tree and room for advancement when possible. The work is not too routine and you could do many things with Dollar Tree.
good,I love working with the managers and other staff members. I work as a cashier and stocking shelves. I help people look for items in the store. Holiday times are hard sometimes because of all the people that come in and we stay open later.
good,"I meet a lot of interesting people as a cashier and I think that's my favorite part of the job.  I don't get very many hours as of right now, however, so I don't get paid much.  it's killing my bank account - my paycheck goes to filling my gas tank up.  And before long it's going to go towards paying off school, which I can't afford right now because of how little I make."
good,"Job was very boring, same thing day in and day out. Managers could have been a little more helpful when it came to older workers lifting heavy product. Pay could have been more. Their 100 percent production rate was easier to reach in some departments versus others."
good,"When i applied for this job i was without work for a while. The work was not the difficult, but to get up at 4am was not something i enjoyed. I appreciate the work experience."
good,"First job, so I learned how to interact with customers as well as management. A typical day at work was great due to it being busy all the time. The hardest part of the job was most of the people that came in didn't speak English, so very hard to communicate at times."
good,Opening the store and getting my work done in a timely manner. I have learned computer work handling a work crew under me. Handling money properly and deposits. It is a fun place to work. The hardest part of the job is getting the people under you to do their job! The most enjoyable part of the job working with the customers to make their visit enjoyable!
good,"Dollar Tree Distribution offers great benefits to full-time and long-term employees. This job would best fit you, if you're no stranger to long hours of manual work."
good,"I do love working for this company, but I get no benefits and only get 15-25 hours a week, and that is for a part-time assistant manager. Ive been with the company for little over 4 years now, starting as a cashier and working my way up to management.  i just wish that their was more that they would offer. I always wanted to go back to school and if they had some kind for program that would allow me to go to school with out leaving my job I would."
good,"Nice company to work for.  Not much room for growth within the company. Fast pace at times, customers are kind most come in several times a day easy to build relationships with them."
good,I haven't been there long enough to really have a opinion of there company.Sorry no comment at this time.Good people.Only a good part time job if you need a little extra money.
good,"It is in between fun and stressful. The customers are great and management is awesome. A typical day at work included running a register, cleaning, stocking and putting away go backs."
good,I went from a cashier to an assistant very quickly. It was a fun place to work with the employees and the customers! I learned how to manage time and job duties to make the store run effectively and efficiently. The store has had busy hours and the employees worked together to quickly serve the customers.
good,"Cash handling, cashiering, stocking. Assisting customers with finding items in the store. Easy going workplace culture. Customers are always nice because everything in the store is a dollar - what a bargain!"
good,"Very busy, high volume location. The present team is knowledgeable and hardworking. The store manager tries to take into consideration everyone's needs."
good,Dollar Tree works as a team. Whenever i go help out at another store i realize that Dollar tree members come together from all places to help out and make things happen!
good,"In a typical work day at the dollar tree as a cashier i ring up sales, balance my till, assist with customer needs, fill balloons, answer incoming calls, and assist customers.  As a stocker, i restock shelves, create various merchandise displays, and assist customers.  I have awesome team members and a supportive supervisor."
good,It was wonderful working there until it was under new management. I was only there for 9 months but I can say I will not miss working there. It did give me working experience though so that's a plus.
good,Work your team and be fair with your Team members try n hire from within . Have a stable work environment and lead from example or your team will not follow you . Lots of work to be done on the floor .
good,"When you will start work, the store will be already clean from the night before, thanks to a good night shift team. So there no need the worry. All you have to do is smile and do your job great the customers and help them when needed. There is alwasy work to be done so you can stay active. The Management will teach you what you need to know, and how to save time while getting the job done right and on time or even faster. The hadest part if the job was to stay on task, will helping customers find what they need."
good,Dollar Tree is a nice friendly place to work in. Only Con is that they give very little hours. A typical day at work includes either unboxing or working on the cashier. I Also encounter a lot of costumers.
good,"Cashiering for Dollar Tree is an easy task to learn thanks to the managers and coworkers. Whenever a problem is present, another employee or the manager always comes to help. The hardest part is definitely being left as the only cashier when others are busy."
good,Dollar tree was my first job I was a cashier and first it was hard but I got the hang of it. The co-workers sacked a little time to time but work always got done
good,"Overall,i enjoyed my job"
good,Learned stocking duties and loved the one on one interaction with customers. Also learned new technical skills and training on computers. I had a wonderful and considerate boss who gave as many hours as possible.
good,I have great coworkers that are team players. I help customers with any of their problems and questions. Typically all systems must be up and running to assure that all customer are being taking care of with efficient time.
good,A typical day of work is being & doing your job duties that comes with your position. You not only perform your managerial duties but you work along side your employees doing the same as they do. The most enjoyable part of job was working along side others performing task in your job title & others.
good,I like working for dollar tree but i dont feel like there is much of an advancement for me within the company. Dollar tree in my opinion is for high school kids or people just starting in the workforce..
good,"I worked at the dollar tree for about 7 months, they had some upper management issues in my location but other that than we had a good crew. We all worked together to achieve the goals needed"
good,"Day goes by fast because there is always work tot be done. Whether its cashier, putting freight out, cleaning up the store, recovering product and doing reshops. There is definitely always something to keep you busy."
good,"They pay good , but the money isn't worth the stress . The holiday time stinks . There want from a manager is too much and they expect so much in so little time"
good,Everyday at work all the co-workers got along. We all made jobs easier by helping each other throughout are shifts. I learned how to communicate with customers. The hardest part of my day was when we got busy.
good,dollar tree is a good store and takes care of its customers but I do not see a future in my life with dollar tree... Its a good starting job I just dont see myself here for the rest of my life.
good,"Many opportunities to move up within the company, once your foot is in the door, there are a lot of possibilities to improve yourself."
good,"I currently work at DollarTree and it is a great place, I am currently working a part-time job and looking for full time. The people I work with are great. They are very understanding and fun to be around. I love meeting new people and being a cashier is a great way to be able to give people the service they need. I can provide them with information that they need regarding anything in the store. The hardest part of the job is dealing with thieves. You need to approach them in a very professional manner. The best part of my job being able to meet new people daily."
good,typical day at dollar tree entailed arriving early to work and counting the cash register drawers to ensure they had the correct amounts in accordance to company policies and then reviewing the store merchandising layouts and bring the correct items from the back storage area on to the min store to be shelved . then put the cash drawers into the registers and assigning the cashiers areas and items to be shelved throughout the day.
good,A day at work would be going between checking people out and putting back merchandise. There is where I first learned to work a register and count money for the till. The management was a bit strict but was always busy on the floors. My co-workers were laid back but we rarely talked. Hardest part was when I had to call a hire up in management just to check a 50 or 100 dollar bill. Most enjoyable was it was slow and not many people and it was super close to home.
good,It's really a calm and relaxing place to work as a part time only. The only problem is that you can not choose your days off and brakes are 7mins long. Low on employees.
good,"This dollar tree has it all, friendly staff and never an empty shelf. The managers are very nice but work always comes first. There is always a person stocking shelves so there will always be what you are looking for and more."
good,"I was pregnant when I started, the staff and management were helpful. I worked as hard as any employee with out the lifting. My return, after a leave of absence, was a little different. Early morning shifts unloading and stocking shelves became my preference."
good,"Show up, get on the register if its busy, straighten the shelves that you can see from your register. I learned the basic stuff about having a retail job since it was my first job. Managers are fun to talk to and hang out with but they arent truly managers. Coworkers are very unique people all with different stories.Hardest part of the job was unloading the truck every week, 1 box at a time in the hot sun. 2000 boxes at a time. Most enjoyable part of the job was closing and driving to the bank with the manager. Just a nice relaxing drive at the end of a hard day"
good,"It was hard work, but being part time my manager was always fair of distributing hours as evenly as possible. I lost weight because of the constant movement."
good,Good job. Easy to learn. Comfortable atmosphere. Not enough hours for regular employees so a 2nd job is a must. Other employees pulled me in and made me one of their own. We exist as one happy family which makes the time we work together easy going and flowing easily.
good,"High Volume. Fast Paced. Ever Changing Priorities. Great, Hard Working People. Hardest part is keeping employees motivated throughout the day long days."
good,Typical work day is loading uboat to fill. I learned to better my merchandising skill. Up management not much communication. Co workers are great. Hardest part of job work-life balance and communication.  I enjoy most is my staff and dealing with the public.
good,I enjoy working for Dollar Tree. I have been working with the company for a year and 3 months and haven't had any problems.
good,"typical day ring up customers, stock inventory, clean store. the things i learned was team work makes a difference in the work place, the management was very professional and flexible. staff were easy going and fun, hardest part of the day would probably be closing due to short time window. the most enjoying part of the job were the different types of customer that came through the store."
good,very good place to work hope to work there in Florida hours good and relaxing atmosphere coworkers nice managers nice .most important part of job was  you looked forward to working there
good,"Busy store with plenty of opportunities for advancement. Merchandising is key, working with district manager to ensure store is running smoothly. Customer service is key at dollar tree"
good,"Very hardworking environment. Management shows lots of appreciation towards employees. Nice breakroom, and compensations towards employees, who work hard"
good,"Typical day depended on what I was scheduled to do.  Some days i was a cashier and worked the register, stocking and helping and greeting customers.  "
good,It was good working there. the other employees were nice and made working there fun. it was a very enjoyable experience.
good,"Dollar Tree offers great product, at unbelievable prices, however, the management selection process needs serious work. The company as a whole offers little to no health insurance and even thought there is a background check to be accepted as a management candidate, I witnessed a degree of favoritism which allowed this step to be placed aside resulting in dishonest management behavior."
good,"dollar tree was a great experience an also the first job i had , I started off as a stocker an moved up to assistant manager in a year."
good,"I really enjoyed this job. It was my first job and it was just a comfortable environment. It was always busy, you always had something to do. Many people that came in taught me life lessons. My favorite was always smile. All employees seemed to work well together. The hardest part were the rude customers. Overall i just loved meeting all of the different people."
good,Love working as stocker. Helping stocked shelves for customers.  Assisted customers and keeping shelves straight.  Would be good for part time work if benefits were not cut.  The lack of hours for part time work is also a downside.
good,"Every day that I go into work my co-workers are happy to see me but inform me of the days work to come to be taken seriously. The management is great, they motivate me and my co-workers to perform at our most efficient. The hardest part of the job is keeping the store well kept but each day I have kept improving this by finding ways to efficiently keep tack of where products are placed and I can quickly recover said products. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing every happy customer showing how my help made their day just a little bit easier. I can say I learned a lot of new skills and behaviors as well as a new language."
good,everything is one dollar how could you not love it. most people love the price and the employees are great really care for one another
good,"In the morning I'm getting the store ready for customers to experience a awesome day at Dollar Tree cleaning work area, cleaning windows. I have learned patients working for Dollar Tree. Management could be a little better My co workers are a little more driven then past co workers. The Hardest part of my job is the hard work but little pay because the job is part time, I enjoy seeing the customer I relate too."
good,it was a very fast paste job but i loved the people i worked arround and it was a very hot work place i was cooking 200 or more bisquits in just 4 or 5 hours
good,"Receive freight from truck utilizing reach lifts, pallets jacks, etc."
good,I loved working there and getting to know all the people from the apartments next door. I loved it but I need something new.
good,"The shifts i had were releatively short. I'd either have stocking shifts or cash shifts. I learned how to stock, front face, reline isles and unload truck shipments. Management was good and nice and the co workers were fun to work with. Hardest part of the job as having an all day cash shift. Best part was stocking shelves."
good,the job was very calm a little stressful at times but i kept a clear and positive outlook on it.. the night schedule overnight had my sleeping schedule a bit off but other than that i enjoyed it.. im looking to help out in any way for work.
good,always understaffed. most of my co-workers would call in sick or show up late and come to work smelling of alcohol. The management was terrible the managers didnt really do their jobs. they would always take unscheduled breaks and stay in the office most of the time. the most enjoyable part of work was when i first started
good,i worked for this company for almost 5 years and enjoyed the work. everyone worked together as a team and that is what made the nights go by fast. I would recommend anyone that is starting their career to start here first
good,"Dealing with customers all day. Handle customer inquiries, complaints, billing questions, payments, and resolve problems. I like to provide my customers with the best customer service I can give them. I believe that I've always been able to learn new things from all of my jobs. Not the safest place to work due to the neighborhood. Not a job that has lots of advancement opportunities, but the  managers and co-workers are great."
good,"like i said i loved this job and it was a great place to work and i love my co workers and i have made friends for life, Its a great place to be"
good,My day was usually good. I would make sure the area was clean that I had enough bag. That the garbage can were clean and if the manager left a note. I made sure that I did everything in the list.
good,"Unloading trucks, the customer is always right, was in management, telling everybody things were $1.00, Enjoyed making customers feel good about the purchases"
good,OK for those who can only work short hours a few days a week. a recommended job for full or part time students. busy shifts with a lot of cleaning and dealing with customers of all kinds. the hardest part of the job is the deadline for your short shift and all u have to do. the best part is talking with costumes and the fact that management as well as the employs are all equals and they treat you as you treat them. out of all the retail jobs I've had this is by far the least dramatic with other employees.
good,"Management at the Dollar Tree is awesome, really a good place to work and shifts are fun and productive. The people at Dollar Tree are very good at what they do."
good,Dollar tree always has work for you to do if not they provide work for you and they always to try and get that task done before there shift is done
good,Great place to work but low paying job and not enough hours.. I wish the company would not hire so many Part Time people and give more hours to the employee's already working there.. also paid them more than minimum wage
good,"It was okay, needed more hours. The people were were great to work with. I got there on time every time I worked, I was treated with respect and I treated everyone and body with respect."
good,"A typical day at the Dollar Tree consisted of restocking the shelves, cleaning around the register and handling cash and handing back proper change when needed to. I learned how to be more patient with hard to handle customers. The management and co-workers were amazing to deal with. It was a super fun place to work."
good,Friendly environment with hard working co-workers. Flexible with employees work schedule due to school or other work.
good,Good store to work for co workers easy to get along with but was forced into accepting a promotion I was not trained properly for and did not want which led to my being let go and unable to go back to my old job
good,"On arriving at work I would check my work station to be sure it was well stocked with the things I would need, ink pen, a full bag rack, dividers, and register tape.  We normally had customers waiting when we opened the doors.  Our customers range in age from very young to very old, buying household goods, party supplies, greeting cards, toys, and seasonal decorations.  When there is a break in my check-out line, I stock the candy and impulse racks.  On the occasions when I was not needed to check I recovered the front of the store and stocked shelves.  At all times I assist customers in finding things that they may not be able to locate."
good,This place will work you to death. But overall its a place that can be your last job. excellent benefits. THe supervisors are all good and thoughtful.
good,"really did like working for dollar tree, the staff is what made it great. also love the flexibility of hours. but sometimes when you need the hours, they cannot afford to schedule you for more."
good,"Dollar Tree was a great place to work, everyone understood they essential of working hard and effectively. Everyone was always happy and great to work around."
good,"great work place, friendly workers, fast past but just enough to make it not a slow day, helped me learn how to hold a job, and help me learn the responsibilitys of being in a store"
good,Overall Dollar Tree/ Deals is a very busy place still working on their management and execution. It is a fun place to work though and I have no problem with my co workers.
good,This is a pretty nice company to work for. Not sure much about the work environment seeing how it was over 16 years ago that I worked there. However at the time I worked there it was a pretty decent place to work and being it was one of my first jobs and they were pretty flexible with my school schedule being a high school kid at the time.
good,"This is a great job for people who enjoy socializing with customers and can handle a hectic work environment. Great for college students and those continuing their education, but the pay isn't that great."
good,a typical day at work stocking stuff on self unloading the items off truck.  I learnt how to communicate with people more. the management at this job is great. co-workers are great they all assist in helping others. the hardest part when it was Christmas time and store be pack. the most enjoyable part of job is see different faces and meeting new people
good,"Obtained good relationships with co-workers and managers. Learned to work well under pressure during rushes, especially around the holidays. Gained customer service experience."
good,"The management here was always very flexible with me about my school schedule. I enjoyed getting to know my coworkers, as well as the regular customers. The only downside is that this is a lower pay rate than what I was used to, along with the the fact that I was also working fewer hours."
good,"the typical day starts out unloading freight off of the trailer."
good,"I worked mostly on register, stocked shelves,and cleaned the store.I learned how to handle money well, got over my fear of using a register. Management was alright, nothing great could've been a bit more organized. My co- workers were the best, would help me when I needed it, gave me direction. The hardest part of the job was dealing with customers who were rude or impatient. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping people in making decisions, helping them find certain things etc."
good,Great work environment with excellent managers aimed to satisfy our customers experience at Dollar Tree.  The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with the customers and assisting in finding their needs.  The hardest part is probably the upkeep of the front store area and the toy area.  Time scheduling is very inconsistent and hours are so random.
good,"Working at Dollar Tree was a little bit new for me. It was my first job and I learned how to use the register, count change, giving back the correct change and making a lot of mistakes. The manager was very nice and understood it was my first job and worked with me through it. The co workers were nice and they helped me whenever I needed help. The hardest part of the job was announcing the specials over the intercom throughout the day with the phone next to the register, I didn't like talking throughout the store in front of people. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers. I didn't see many people come back every time of my shift so it was neat to meet new people."
good,"I worked as cashier and stocker. I enjoyed the customers and the co-workers that I had worked with. My manager was great to work for. There was no hard part to this job. I would check out customers,  unload the merchandise trucks, unpack and display merchandise, clean the store."
good,"I enjoy coming to work, a smile on my face, lots of different things to learn. I'm still really new, But I like my coworkers. love dealing with the customers, and having a good time!"
good,"I'm apart of the management staff and, I deal with counting the safe/tills, making sure the sales floor is clean and neat for each opening/closing, and take in deliveries from multiple companies to keep the store stocked every day. I deal with customers consistently asking me where items are and I have almost completely memorized where everything is located. I always show each customer the utmost respect, and help them to the best of my abilities to find what they need when they need it. I work well with all of the other employees, I love them and we all treat each other as though we are family. The hardest part of my current job is the abundance of tasks that need to be complete in the short time we have to complete it all in. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with my co-workers, and the public. I like customer service, and I enjoy talking to people and learning new things."
good,"Huge company that has over 6,000 stores, which gave me the ability to learn how to mange money as well as coworkers. The most enjoyable part of my job was the attention I gave my costumers."
good,"It was okay, but scheduling was often a mess, was often hiring people that never wanted to work and always having to cover their shifts at the last minute, and the pay for the amount of our unreasonable workload was nowhere near comperable"
good,"I enjoyed working at The Dollar Tree, especially around the holidays. The holidays challenged my customer service skills and increased my speed at the cash register. I enjoyed working with our customers, and the staff was great, too."
good,Dollar Tree was My First Job. I Didn't Get To stay long But it Was Fast Paced And A Learning experience. My Co-workers Was Caring And taught me necessary things i need to know.
good,I was a cashier for about 3 weeks at  holiday time.  I worked the cash register.  I returned items to the shelves and learned to use a cash register.  I didn't have many hours per week.
good,"My typical day was go in around 5am, go to the back and set up U-boats in correct location . When truck arrives place over 1000 pcs onto U-boats and distribute them to the right isles. After the turck is finished i would go to my assigned isle and stock and front shelves"
good,Every day was a new day with its challenges. I helped re organize the store and to see the customers attitudes change with the store was amazing. The store was a great store to work for the store manager did what he could do for employees. I think the only hard part of the job was that I couldn't please every customer.
good,"Over all a great place to work, would tell anyone this would be a good place to work and play...full time is 8 hours a day, good training, co-worker are nice and management is fair and good"
good,"Some what fast paced, nice work environment, employees were not that bad. Management could have been a lot better, overall a nice experience."
good,was a ok place to work before this company took over they got to big for there britches and were overwhelmed quickly not like it and when girlfriend had high risk pregneance they let her go
good,"stocking is fast and keeps me busy. I start with getting my float with freight  on it and normally do 2-3 in 5 hours. how ever I do not the hours, I need more.  I started with around 35-40 a week and we were all cut to 15-20 a week. I also wish the higher management would listen to some of the stockers ideas."
good,"I thoroughly enjoy working at Dollar Tree. I am currently laid off from there, but hope to go back in a few months when our remodel is done. I've worked there for 10yrs, and I love the job. I enjoy the employees, and the customers. The best part is the customer base, You get to know your customers on a more intimate level, since it is a small town. I learned people skills, money handling, some management skills, paperwork, computers, and opening and closing of a store."
good,I enjoyed my short time at Dollar Tree. I wish I could has stayed beyond seasonal employment. The hardest part of my job was dealing with training management.
good,"Working at the Dollar Tree is very enjoyable. As a cashier I am responsible for ringing out purchases as well as providing customer service. Additionally, I am in charge of stocking the shelves and maintaining the appearance of the store. My favorite part of my job has to be the pleasant interactions and conversations I share with my fellow employees as we work together throughout the day."
good,"Dollar Tree is all right for part-time workers who have more than just work on their schedule, like school for example. Dedication to the job and customers are highly valued by their crew."
good,"Boring, Stressful, too many attitudes, too much complaining, people not doing work, people walking around eating, people stealing, it was horrible and management sucked that is why so many people quit or got fired because didn't nobody know how to run the place."
good,"I worked as a Sales Associate, Its very good place to gain experience. I worked one year and I gain good experience for customer service."
good,"This is a place where you can joke when you work, but when it was time to work things got done. I learned how to properly stock the shelves, and how to prioritize my time between my management position and the stocking position. The co workers were friendly and sweet. I think the hardest part of this job was needing to be firm about the duties. Not all of the employees wanted to do the work that was required.The most enjoyable part of my day was when there was no down time between interacting with the customers, to dealing with the employees, and even the paper work."
good,Nice Place to work just very low pay scale and not many hours. Always have to be patient when dealing with the public. For the most part everyone is nice to work with.
good,"A typical work day would and does include counting of your drawer before and after your shift, making small talk with customers as they come to cash out thanking them for their business along with inviting them back. Making small talk with co-workers and having a few laughs as the day goes by."
good,"This is a great place to work at. Fun work enviornment and pleasant people. My days at work consists of clocking in, getting my drawer, getting to my register, tuning on my light, checking customers out, working on the u boat and repairing damages in between, clearing my register, putting go backs away and then taking down my drawer and clocking out. "

good,"A typical day consist of either working the register or creating displays for the merchandise. I learned that the way you set things up is appealing to the eye, which will make people want to buy it. My manager was laid back for the most part, but serious about the rules. The rules were simple and easy to follow so he rarely said anything about breaking or bending them. My co-workers had an understanding of their roles, and everyone did what they were told. The hardest part was finding something to do even if everything was done already. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers. They made the hours go by faster and my day a little more interesting."
good,"Very Friendly atmosphere. I was here for a short period of time in between jobs, and greatly appreciated the light hearted nature and easy going attitude of all employees and management"
good,"Everyday at work I would assist customers, work the cash register, clean the bathroom, fill the pop machines, stock products, and help out the managers.  I have learned how to multitask, communicate better with people, and also know when someone needs assistance.  My managers were very helpful, kind, and grew on me very quick.  The hardest part of the job was trying to stock and work the cash register, but I learned how to maneuver them together in know time. My managers were the best part of the job because they were very encouraging while I also went to school."
good,"Everything at Dollar Tree is truly a dollar, so this means customers are constantly entering the store seeking a variety of products. This also means the store can become busy quickly. This taught me to be quick and efficient with customers and their merchandise and to be greet every customer with a smile. "
good,"Working for this company for 3 years, I have seen it all. My co-workers were a pleasure to work with and management was excellent. "
good,I felt they needed to give workers more hours. What I learned from this job was that just because they hire you doesn't mean they have to give you a lot of hours. Management was very stressed out. The co-workers was team players. The most enjoyable part of the job was when we would get things done on time. Plus when id get some hours to work.
good,"From the managers to the associates were easy to work with. We created a great system to provide the best customer service to every customer,"
good,A typical day of work was clock in and wait for a customer. If you had no one to help then stock the shelves or blow some balloons and keep the store clean. My manager and co-workers weren't really around unless called that was the hard part figuring everything out alone but it was a job so I enjoyed that.
good,"A typical day for me would vary depending on the time i worked because there was a high school next to me. Usually i'd get busy days cashiering becuase of all the kids coming from school or i'd get the slow mornings cashiering with minimal people coming. Overall it was a great job, especially because it was my first job. The manager there was really awesome, i still go by and talk to him to this very day, he was a very helpful and fun guy to be around. I only had a hard time with my first week on the job as a chasier but it all came to be fairly easy as i got the hang of it."
good,a great place to work for  need more leaders that care about the needs in to be organization but the pay is great and time off as well
good,"A typical day at dollar tree is busy,fun and friendly interacting with the customers was my favorite part.I stayed busy and loved the atmosphere and my co-workers."
good,"I left because I had a better opportunity for what I wanted to do with my life, but it's not a bad place to be, at all. I would work there again! Some of the clientele can leave something to be desired, but that's the same way everywhere."
good,"typical work day goes by really smooth everyone has their own section to work on chemical, toys, etc. Everyone gets along well with one another. Hardest part about my job would be keeping count off all the boxes I go thru while at work."
good,"- Recieves shipment from trucks. "
good,"Only get anywhere from 9 to 15 hrs per week, so its okay for a second job. Managers are very friendly and helpful. Great staff!"
good,During my first time with Dollar Tree I worked with a different store manager and staff. While I enjoyed some of the staff most were unmotivated and lacked in drive often times leaving their work behind for others to make up.

I worked mainly as a Forklift Operator and my jobs was to move freight with the forklift, color coordinate pallets, load truck with pallets, operator the bale machine whether using cardboard or plastic."
good,"A typical day is mostly about being able to balance when to be at the register to ring up customers and when to be doing other tasks such as putting returned items back on the shelves, refilling soda coolers, bringing misplaced items to their correct shelves, and helping customers find items within the store."
good,"This was a nice company to work for. There was a lot to do to keep busy. Everything in the store was a dollar, so there was no need to price things, and customers weren't confused as to how much anything was. freight was important. As it came in it needed to go out. with things only being a dollar there was a lot of merchandise bought daily, and it constantly need replenished. We had huge semi's full of merchandise sometimes daily to deal with. because dollar tree was one of my first management retail jobs, it made me very productive with stocking and purging the stock rooms. I learned a lot from them and that was my stepping stone to moving up into a full time management position to further my career."
good,My job as an assistant manager at the Dollar Tree has taught me a variety of skills that are valuable to other places of employment. Being an assistant manager has taught me how to effectively lead a diverse team of associates in order to have a business that runs in an productive and profitable manner. During a typical shift at the Dollar Tree I am tasked with opening or closing the store. I also am required to make a judgement call and divide up the work among the associates that are working in order to maximize their skills in order to get the most productivity out of them.
good,"It was a good place to work with a great employer. My co-workers"
good,Fun environment but not enough employees to get the work done thats needed. Have to deal with a lot of different personalities and strange events that take place.
good,"Good pay.  Hard work.  They work you like a slave, but there is plenty of opportunity for advancement if you have half a brain."

good,Dollar Tree was a good experience. You cashiered and stocked freight. You also recovered the store.
good,"Stock shelves, organize stock room, rotate product, set aisle per plan-a-grams."
good,"a typical day at work: Go in, get set up for what you have to do, and do it."
good,"The Job is OK My Co workers are good Its retail work Unloading freight, stocking and taking care of customers"
good,i can honestly say i love the management and other employees. its your typical retail job but the customers and the people you work with can make your day. very friendly people.the hardest part of the job is heavy lifting at times and standing on your feet all day.
good,Productive and engaging place to work with opportunity to grow with company.

good,"Busy place. Customers mostly enjoyable,due to the interesting things we offer to buy. I learned about retail, and management. The management were helpful whenever there was a problem. I had a good rapport with my co-workers. The hardest part of my job was mopping the store. The experience I received and helping customers was my most enjoyable part."
good,Well I would come in to work on truck day unload the truck stock what we had left over from the day before. Continue doing the same thing the following day
good,it was a temporary position i took when i was hired but i loved it there. the time i was there when by too fast. everyone got along and had a good time while we worked to get things done on time and we learned alot of new things. it was  to see the store go from what it did to looking so different and knowing i had a part in doing that it made me feel really good about myself and that well all worked together as a team to get it done.
good,"Good starting job you learn how to help customers, work with interestingly fun people and its a flexible schedule."
good,Work was usually a long ten hour day. You get two 15min breaks and one 30min break. The management was fairly new and from different states so it was very unorganized. They were trying to get this building on its feet. Co workers were very friendly and helpful even though it was a competitive job. The hardest part of the job was not knowing what part of the warehouse you would be working in that day. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning new things in a warehouse everyday because i worked in every section but shipping and recieving.
good,Seasonal job only for holidays not enough hours nor pay I would only work like three times out of the week
good,"Fun from beginning to end "
good,"very good company to work for. pay scale could have been better,the reason i left the company was there was very little room for advancement at the time and Family Dollar came in to the store and recruited me be put into the district mgr. training program.turns out Dollar tree bought out Family Dollar in july and they let us go.But in looking back i should have stayed with this company."
good,I enjoyed managing the employees and speaking with customers on a daily basis. I loved helping others find what they needed.
good,I like working with the public so working at the Dollar Tree was a fun job to me. I always tried my best to make sure all customers were checked out in a timely manner. And always greet customers with a smile and welcome them to the store.
good,it was always slow so i had lots of time to stock and make sure my area was cleaned and organized
good,It was a great opportunity to have as a first job.While iI worked there I learned alot.
good,"Dollar Tree is a small store, there's alot of customers but they are in and out through the day instead of in the store all at once. Management was usually in the back handling paperwork or something so I was left to run the front desk unless I needed help. I always worked with about 3 co-workers every day unless a truck came. Everything about this job was easy, no hard days at work!"
good,The people that work their are very friendly. The managers there are super nice. The only thing I do not like is dealing with customers. I do recovery and there are just certain customers that do not care that your cleaning. A mess will always be there even if I just cleaned there is a mess 5 minutes later and especially if the kids have no discipline its worse. Other than that its a great place to work at.
good,"Loved the employees, advanced quick, pay was not that great, worked full time hours but was kept at part time so i was unable to get benefits"
good,"I cash customers out and help them find what they are looking for clean and re-stock the store. "
good,customers are great people who come in daily and just make the day for me
good,I like that fact tha Dollar Tree keeps me busy throughout a work day.

good,"Working at Dollar Tree Canada is great. In a typical day there is usually always plenty work to do, which is great. The co-workers are great people and easy to get along with. Because the store is located within a plaza, there is a large traffic flow of customer's which is great because it is nice to get to interact with different people. Management is great within my specific store. The job is not very difficult so long as the employee understands their role."
good,Another hardworking job early in my life that helped teach me values and morals.
good,A very busy environment with little down time. Ran cash register as well as stocked shelves and helped customers.

good,always challenge if you work at the right store. great company if you into manager.
good,"Fast pace, high volume distribution setting.  Opportunity for growth in certain regions.  Off peak hours offer a great work/life balance.  More focus needs to be spent on upgrading WMS/YMS/LMS."
good,"Going into Dollar Tree every employee was happy even though we got there at 5 in the morning some days to unload boxes, but i learned how the job-life works and how hard yet rewarding it is. The hardest part of the job was the crowds we get but it was all worth it when the customers were happy."
good,"All in all the job is simple. Cashiering, stocking and loading/unloading the truck. Simple and time consuming. But the corporation as a whole needs a total revamping. Trucks barely come on time and on the same day. There's room to move up but not sure how long you need to be with the company to do so. It's a dollar store so no discounts, no benefits being part time."
good,"I dont like being stuck in one place in a job, and this company gave me an opportunity to move ahead and prove myself.good job."
good,"productive, great learning experience, great co-workers. management  "
good,"In the nine months I have been with this company I have gotten to learn numerous skills. A typical day as a cashier is scanning items for a customer and handling money. When I was free of customers I was facing my sections of the store and restocking if needed. On days I recover, that consists of facing and gathering items that don't belong and putting them back."
good,"My typical day at work includes stocking out as much merchandise as I can while still being there to assist customers frequently."
good,"Great store, wonderful customers, and easy to work with co-workers."
good,"A fun place to work. Co-workers are great. Higher management can't seem to make up their mind on what they want to happen in the store ( hours for employees, set up of displays, etc.)"
good,nice place to work while i was in school and got good hours for a high schooler
good,Made dairy and freezer announcements and greeted customers.

Opened and closed the store, did deposits, counted the safe, did cashier audits, put cashiers on tills and took them off at the beginning and end of shifts, did returns, did write offs ( markup/mark downs), managed the cashiers on duty,"
good,Its nothing more than you would expect from a seasonal job. Was pretty average all around. Great customers and location!
good,Its a very good job. The days consist of working really hard to get the work done.
good,"A typical night at Dollar Tree consists of fast paced freight processing, recovery and clean up. Depending on what section your working in determines the quota that needs to be met by the end of the night. On Tuesdays and Fridays we get our trucks, and those days consist of unloading the truck, putting boxes in the their proper departments. Once finished with that our day continues as usual with processing frieght to the floor. The management was okay. Assistant Managers are alot more appreciative of the work done around store. Coworker are all cool, everyone stays busy so not much time for socialization. The most enjoyable part of the job is the team, we all work and get the job done."
good,"management was horrible, not a very good place to work. That's why I decided to go to school."
good,"If I worked the opening shift a typical day would be to turn on the registers and fix any of the merchandise that is out of place. After, you go into the office to count the money or "" till"". Now it's time to open the doors and greet the customers. I learned what it's like to experience a first job, also the feeling of earning a paycheck. My management was firm but fair. From my first day to my last my co-workers helped me get comfortable with working a cash register and communicating with people. The hardest part of the job was dealing with non-friendly customers. The most enjoyable thing was actually have my first job and a way to show how much iv'e grown by working and earning money."
good,I worked in the HR department under one of the best supervisors I have ever worked for.  I enjoyed all of my co-workers we became family.  A typical day at work could be hectic but because of the team I worked with we always managed to have fun while working and being productive
good,The hickory dollar tree is a very tough and very stressful environment and very fast paced
good,"some days i opened the store and some days i closed the store, stocked the shelves and ran register when customer volume required it my co workers were pleasant to work with management was wonderful. I enjoyed my job although it was only for a short period of time my family necessaties required more then 26 hrs. a week so i moved on for more financial stability."

good,"everyday i have a smile on faces"
good,At dollar tree i was responsible for numerous things;such as ordering supplies for the store and also ordering product for the store. I greeted each customer that came into the store and provided them with outstanding customer service.

good,"i start at 8a.m washing windows, as the store opens i start the register and contiune as a cashier.."
good,"I was a key holder."
good,"My time at the Dollar Tree was about 2 years. I was passed over for advancement 3 times, got one personal raise and one time from the company that everyone can recieve. I felt that I was a valuable asset to the company and my pay, benefits and hours did not reflect that. My store manager was great, but the assistant managers were all lazy. "

good,i like to work hard so this is a good job. get into work get a trailer assighned to me. i get my truck unloaded and merchandise seperated on individual palets. this job requires you to work at 100% productivity. i run a 180- 250% in production.
good,I traveled to a few other stores and realized that the same district manager has different rules for every store. In my main store we couldnt be doing one thing but in the other store they could. Something Dollar tree needs to regulate
good,I worked in the morning and stocked merchandise and gave associates jobs to do. then I ordered merchandise and made deposits. 
good,A very fast paced workplace. You learn a lot of the do's and don'ts in retail to survive. You get a lot of experience in budgeting money and people. There are good benefits for the management staff. You need to have good communication skills with your co-workers to make everything run smoothly. The hardest part of the job was trying to juggle everything that was expected of you with very limited hours and employees. I enjoyed my customers and working with my co-workers.

When I worked there I learned how to run a register, count the till, stock shelfs and run boats. The management in my opinion was favortisum. I personally thought the management favored some of there employee's a lot more then others. The co-workers were very fun to work with and some became friends. The hardest part of my job really was nothing, I enjoyed the fact I got to interact with other people."
good,"I moved through several Dollar Trees in my five years there, but the store I started at was my favorite. It was my home store, and literally the best maintained store in our district. The store manager works his butt off to make sure everything is as great as it can be, and everybody loves him. That's what really makes the difference. If your managerial team sucks, then you probably won't have a good time working at a Dollar Tree anywhere. Also, they don't pay nearly enough to have to deal with the awful customers you get. Minimum wage is NOT enough at all, especially while trying to handle the freight trucks, which can sometimes be more dangerous than it should be."
good,"While we were setting up the store to open we would each grab a few boxes at a time and unload all the merchandise out from the boxes so that they could be placed on the proper shelves. I loved stocking merchandise, I enjoyed putting all the items where they belonged. I learned how to read that sheet of paper that has a list of all the items per shelf. Our boss was real easy going, she made us feel appreciated for the hard work we contributed as well as she had done. I enjoyed working in a team, we would sometimes work in groups and help each other stock the proper items."

good,"Dollar Tree was my first job after high school and I enjoyed working there. The staff was friendly yet they still made sure you were doing your job. I was hired as temporary seasonal help with the chance to stay on permanently if they liked my work. However, I had to quit due to my grandfather getting sick. I was able to be myself while working there and the job was fast-paced and fun. I got along with all of my coworkers and the employees. I ran the register, cleaned the store, and stocked products. I also helped customers and counted down my drawer after my shift."
good,if you enjoy working with people and have good customer service skills then u will enjoy working in a place like this
good,I'ts a nice place to work . Manger worked with me when my mom was sick and was so understanding. the ones i work with some days feel like family.mangers some time s will bring in food to let us know we are doing a good job and they will tell us nice job

good,really fast paced and fun. as long as u come to work and do your job you will be ok.

good,"it is a fast paced place always moving, opening the store closing store. I learned how to merchandised the product for best sales. It was a good place to work"
good,overall great work experience. great first job or a part time after school job
good,"Working for Dollar Tree is a challenging and rewarding environment that keeps me busy from start to finish. As a Store Manager, it is my responsibility to find the best talent and train them to work at the productivity levels Dollar Tree demands. Failure to run a highly productive teams at all times will result in a quick build up of back stock and poor conditions on the salesfloor. The hardest part of the job is developing and maintaining this team. The management at Dollar Tree is clear and consistent in their expectations. Dollar Tree allows me to make the decisions in my store and likewise, hold me accountable for the results. Working for Dollar Tree has greatly improved my time management skills."
good,"While I have the experience, in working in a much more Professional Office Setting, I do provide the same amount, and ability for this position as I would any. Good Customer Service skills are key to any job position, and I give 100% of my ability to ensure the best quality service I can provide."
good,I enjoyed the customers and was great at my job but I was paid very little money for the job I did.
good,"This was a fun place to work to learn the retail industry. The day was very busy with helping customers, stocking shelves and learning how to stock properly. Meeting new people on a daily basis was the best part."
good,"Typical day at dollar tree was stocking, cashiering, making daily and nightly deposit, planning out daily activities for employees, customer service"
good,it was alright place to work if your just looking for something to do.
good,"There are good and bads, i quickly advanced to management but once you there your kind of stalled. long hours rarely a weekend off and alot of manual labor. not to mention waiting on customers and cleaning up after people who trash the store"
good,"This was my first job, and a great stepping stone for jobs to come. This job taught me how to handle myself in the workplace, and good people skills working in customer service."
good,"This was a very fun place to work , and you were able to meet many people,from many different places, city's etc.. The work was not too hard to do and the hours were great. The co-workers were a good bunch of people who like to come to work ,get the day done and go home ( i had a great team). the hardest part was the late night bank deposits."
good,Co-Workers were great to work with. Management was OK. Hardest part of the job was warranties.
good,Typical Shift is around 4.5 hours. Cashiers are responsible for the front of the store. As well as go backs and merchandising.
good,IT was not a fast paced job but i just didnt get much hours the truck days was my longest day
good,My typical work day lasts for five hours. during this time I would work on the register while doing other things during a slow period. This includes restocking shelves and recovering the store.
good,its really fun meeting new people. i learn how get better at speaking to people an answering there questions about the the store.the management was great.My co-workers where great to there were fun to get along with they though me how to work around there. My hardest part of the job was how fast it was when i barely started to work there.The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to help people and answering there questions.
good,"Day started y begin on time, but i was always early. I dont like to be late. Then we get stuff ready to open store. I would help customers to find what they were looking for and stock shelfs and cashier. I really enjoyed the management and we always had a good time same as co-workers. The most enjoyable part was getting to greet and meet all different people. Theres really any hard part to this job."
good,gettring personnel to do what is expected of them is the hardest part of the job. dealing with customers can be the most enjoyable part of the job
good,great workplace to work at.
good,"fun,friendly upbeat atmosphere.clean and fast paced as well."
good,Dollar Tree gave me the skills to work with several different people and to have better people skills. I have been able to take this experience with me to new jobs.
good,They were always stealing at the location I was at . It was frustrating snd I wasn’t about to chase after anyone . I mean come on now it was only for a dollar .
good,"Pretty good. Fast paced, but good if you're not super lazy. Nice management, and simple customer service. Training is easy, and just takes a bit of getting used to. Daily tasks are written."
good,The one thing you have look out for are some shoplifters but over all the place is not all bad. Don't forget to wear green and black or tan pants then you wiil be good
good,"Management did not care about employees, breaks were not giving in a reasonable time frame . Random schedule changes . Not flexible with hours. Just basically felt like the company could care less"
good,I loved working here it was the number one job i would consider in going back to with the same workers and manager the work environment was like a second home to me
good,"Good company. Bad management. Would recommend for students looking for part time or seasonal work. Hours are flexible. Pay could be much better. Not bad, not great."
good,Happy and good place to meet new people. Learning new things and new things about people and what does on in a day's work. Working at the dollar is a good place to start.
good,"It is very simple, extremely easy. The managers were pretty helpful in teaching and assisting in different task. This company is a good place to start working at if you have minimal experience. It's a good balance of some stress and some smoothness."
good,"I enjoyed working for Dollar Tree over all. A typical day would be building safe, and ship-able pallets, for various regional retail store orders. I learned the art of order selection. The third shift management was great, I found them to be professional, considerate, and appropriately involved in the shift teams overall success. The D.T. culture shifts quite a bit because there is a general high turn over (However, the core management, and long term crew seem to offer a consistent moral that is satisfactory)."
good,"It's an easy job alot of the task are very simple, but it's alot of work to do. The customers are very nice and, very understanding. If you like to stay active this is the job for you."
good,"It's l"
good,"I only worked there 9 days. It was a one-time employment to assist in setting up the store for a grand opening. Responsible for setting up shelving, and stocking in preparation for grand opening."
good,Hands down my favorite job. Very friendly work environment. Management knows how to get things done and is very helpful with new employees. Everyone works as a great team to get things done.
good,"Fast-paced"
good,I loved the kind of work it was they expected way to much but I just did my best it was stress reliever for me to throw the cases I loved it and I want to go back
good,I would love too clean up in there and stocked stuff and pick up thing all the time ??i would like for all to get me another job somewhere else so I can clean up
good,"Although I only worked a part time at Dollar Tree the few hours I would spend at work were fun, Seeing people happy with all their cool dollar items, Greeting them as they walked in and as they would leave the store. At dollar tree I learned how to work the register and manage cash and credit card transactions."
good,It’s a good job. I can’t complain it’s just hours. I have a life and can’t work one or two days a week. I also love my customers there. The management part wasn’t to bad either.
good,It was pretty fun working there. Although at times rough due to certain assignments piling over you one after another because of corporate visits and/or employee's not showing up for their assigned shifts.
good,"the biggest complaint I heard was that the hours were too few. the biggest complaint I had was that they wanted a quota that I consistently had trouble meeting even when I pushed myself. My managers were very nice, co-workers change every couple of months. If you want 20 hours or more this isnt the job for you, I almost never got 20+ hours a week"
good,when I first started working for them I was excited but like most jobs after a while a lot of things changed and became different. i think now that I am not to happy with a lot of things that happen there.
good,"I enjoyed the work and the people.   The majority of the staff were not serious and irresponsible about their work ethic.  The employees felt and were mostly disposable,"
good,It was great experience and loved the employees there..!!! It’s was mostly training in there for me..I learned how to deal with employees that don’t do their jobs..Management was GREAT!!!
good,It was a pretty good job. It was fun to be honest but I didn’t like the requirements for overnight work. They expected the same from everyone but not everyone works the same and progresses the same.
good,I would greet the customers scan items on my cash register with checks cash or discount using coupons I would’ve assist Them in fighting items if they needed help that was out of my reach I would contact management
good,"I would have liked to stayed working at Dollar Tree, but I wasn't getting many hours and I wasn't getting paid a lot. If my wages were increased and I was able to work more hours I would have stay working there."
good,Good place to work benefits are ok not what they used to be.  Get overtime when needed and yearly evaluation.  Management is ok too not much room to advance as I would think there would be.
good,At the end I did not like not being present when my drawer was checked at the end of the night. Appatantely two people did not have to be in there. Fomm what I understand and for the assistant manager it is policy to have two people when counting down the drawer.
good,"A typical day of work at Dollar Tree is easy, shipments of new merchandise every week so there is always something new to stock and sell.  They taught me a lot about retail, the general manager I worked for was the best boss, the managers below the general manager were so-so, but that will vary from store to store. Advancement to Assistant Manager/stock manager, etc are fairly quick and easy to obtain if you want the role (pay is above min wage for these positions).  The pay for cashier/stocker is min wage and I worked there for almost a year with no raise, I left for a better paying job."
good,"I love my coworkers but the pay is extremely low and I have no interest in being a manager. My manager does her job well and is really nice, and understands my need for a flexible schedule. So this only works for me as a temporary job"
good,I enjoyed the other employees as well as the work. It can at times be a little stressful as with any job. However they are great about working with your schedule to help meet employee needs.
good,"Great team work everyone works together and gets things done. Management was always there to help you in anything you needed."
good,"Working at the Dollar tree was a good experience ,I learned a lot more about retail ,it was a very peaceful environment, co workers were very friendly."
good,"Working with the staff and customers was great. It was nice to know that some customers remembered me. "
good,Worked there and loved it until managers started not doing things right. Lost respect and motivation to work here. Really too bad because I really did enjoy it when it was good.
good,it was a very rewarding experience but i feel like i wasn’t allowed to live up to my full potential and it was very mismanaged and i should have kept my book open to other jobs !
good,My experience working there  gave me more experience in retail marketing such as  pulling and stocking from backroom to sales floor. It also give me the ability to show that i could do production at time giving and at steady pace.
good,I enjoyed working at dollar tree. All of the employees were kind and helped each other out. The only thing I didn’t like was that I didn’t work very much. I mostly worked 1 to 3 times a week for about 5 or 6 hours.
good,It was a good job.They give opportunity.You just have to be willing to go for it .I like the job.It was fun .I learned skills.some management have personal issues but if u stay to yourself u have no issues. I only worry about the hours
good,Dollar tree paid minimum wage it’s not something you can live off but just part time it’s okay. Part time there’s not too many hours but the good thing is that the store doesn’t get too busy and it’s relaxed for the most part.
good,Worked with the company for over 10 years. Its a place where you can grow. Came in as seasonal help and finished as a Store Manager. The company is big on hiring internally. Great benefits and good people.
good,"I liked working there and learning different things each day, my coworkers were nice and respectful and my managers were great people and treated all of us with respect and took care of us."
good,"It can be busy at times but in the slow times you have plenty to do from reorganizing the balloons to sweeping, cleaning the registers area, etc. the management was always chill and it was always a silly environment"
good,"Hello I enjoyed working at the Dollar Tree ,I became an asst manager when I transferred to another store ,and the only thing I didn't like was that they stuck me to nights and I wasn't told I was doing that ,I would have love to open sometimes and not close every night ,I was a good closer I made sure the store was clean and ready to open for business ,now I go in the store where I work and its a mess ,the store is not taking care of her store ,there are go backs all over the store ,and the store not clean right and also there is boxes in front of the store that should be put away and ect… ,im sorry I wish I could help them but she said there was no hours ,so they don't want to work they just there to get a check and the store manager too and this is in las vegas the store is located on lake mead and simmons ,wish I was the store manager the store wouldn't look like that . only a ex concern employee"
good,I would probably still be with them but i had back surgery which cause me to have a stroke 4 days later. I truely enjoyed working there and the staff was friendly. We had the best management staff in the company in my opinion
good,"parttimers worked from 4 hours to five, four no lunch , five have to have lunch, silly its half hour, so 4.5. our people got along fine, young people come and go, here today gone tomorrow. I was offered manager job for nites, to much stress, I would really like to get back into store."
good,"I have enjoyed my job for the most part, any disagreeable parts are not usually directed at my dept. I love the work and like my co- workers.  Most management issues have been resolved it has changed a lot in the last year and is more employee friendly now.  Dollar Tree the company is easy to work for and an awesome company with great stuff and variety. Wonderful place to shop and save the name brand items amaze me."
good,Need to inform employees about the daily lifting required.  Found it excessive.  The management and human resources were lacking information to improve your work experience.  Didn't feel there was anyone in charge to help you with your questions.  Felt like a  number..
good,"Fast pace. A typical day at work is running the register, bagging items, helping customers with questions about items, cleaning the front area and stocking items.Management is tough but once they get to know you they are pretty cool. I learned how to stock items. I am a single person with no benefits and no welfare assistance. The Head Manager and Co-manager throw me extra hours when they have them. The hardest part of the job is you stand for 4.5 - 5.5 hours a day with just a 10 minute break. The most enjoyable part of my job is: I have met a lot of interesting people (customers) and some of my co-workers are funny and treat me fairly."
good,Good place to work nice people to work with work place friendly clean.  We love our customers the stores are stocked nice ever day it a safe environment
good,it’s a bit disorganized but overall relaxed and easy. Great deals good people good discounts good good good. This description is a bit overkill so I’m just writing at this point.
good,"was a decent place to work, I enjoyed blowing up balloons, cashiering was easy and during slow time would clean up and stock around registers. Responsible for counting til before and after shift"
good,"Enjoyed co-workers and job.  Hours flexible and varying. Able to get hours off with advanced request.  Temperature in building usually too hot,   Stand for long periods without break."
good,"Overall the job was fairly good. It’s a good balance between work and life, I would recommend this job for anyone who’s looking to get their first job."
good,This job is a great position to have for a good company. The management a majority helpful and a joy to work for.  The most enjoyable part are my coworkers
good,"a typical day includes dealing with customers possessing great customer service skills, stocking and housekeeping, such as sweeping, mopping, wiping down shelves, cleaning restrooms. running a register, having shift audits, shift reports."
good,"It’s a great place to work if your in high school or if your looking something more slow paced but around the holidays it speeds up, it’s a great environment an good people."
good,I love being the only cashier on duty. My manager is very nice and easy to work with. I would love it if I could receive more than 15 hours a week but all in all its a great place to work.
good,"If you people person and such,then you will like this job and plus it has it slow days and busy days. Even in busy days,out still cool and smooth. Plus wiil help you focus more and multi task better. Only thing is which it gave at least little more hours."
good,Had flexible hours great store to work for. Fun environment great customers at times. Was always busy made time go a little faster. Luv working with the public
good,There is always something to do at work. It is very productive and you learn something everyday. Management is always on top of everything that happens in the business.
good,all in all a good place to work except you do your job and everyone elses. if you didn't have to do that then you could get your job done. I really liked my job.
good,I ran the main cash register.  When not on the register I was stocking shelves.  I very much enjoyed both the people I worked with as well as the customers.  It was a fun job as the atmosphere was positive.  The only negative would be that the hours and pay would never be enough to support a family.
good,"YOU have to have a strong mind, completely focused and have an eye on the finish. Discount retail at the lowest price point. Stores do well, profit margins are outstanding. Theft is a constant struggle both from the hire anyone and always hiring mentality to the lack of respect that sometimes accompanies the average shopper. I am in high volume store with its own unique demographic challenges but the things are also what makes it so successful. I bonus monthly with reasonable expectations of growth and there is always some little contest to win ""stuff"". If you are tough as nails, communicate well and want to stay busy , this might be job for you. You must move with a sense of urgency in everything, you will constantly be moving, great cardio ! 5 day work week except christmas which is 6 for a short sprint.Vacations and sick time are generous , but there are black out dates. Weekly sales meeting, monthly DM visits, yearly inventory revue and count. Retail is retail, you either have a mind for it or you dont."
good,"Dollar tree is a laid back atmosphere. But I wish we had more benefits, hours, and I wish we didn't get written up so much for voids. But other than that I honestly have no complaints, it's an awesome company, idea, and extremely popular with all kinds of people."
good,"It was great, but there were a lot of cons vs pros. Definitely a wonderful job for SAHM that want to get out a few times a week! Management was great!! I learned a lot of things about customer service. It’s a good beginner job. Doesn’t pay bills. But good for play money!"
good,walking in and clocking in was the most boring part but after ringing up a few people you will know if you have a easy day or a stressful day. everyone there was fun and exciting and helpful.
good,Loved working there.... managers were awesome. Love working with the public learned how to stock fast the hardest part was tge truck .... it was interesting and fun to see all the new items each week ....
good,"If you are a student looking for a great part time job while in school or a working professional that may need money on the side, this is the job for you. I worked there in 2014 and the hours were not consistent but that was mainly because we acquired a new supervisor. I enjoyed meeting new people and working in an environment that I could be around people constantly."
good,"Dollar Tree is a decent place to work at. Schedules are posted for the currents and following week. Co-workers eventually become like family. Everyone communicates so things run smoothly."
good,"log into the system in the morning to make sure my equipment works.I learned the computer system putting things away,working well with others and to be a leader.  Getting items to send out.management is okay we work as a team to get the job done employees work together some times the system down we can not work"
good,"Job was pretty simple, work days were never really too long. On some days it was pretty slow and others were busy but not too hectic. I really enjoyed the employees there they were really nice people. Overall i enjoyed the job."
good,"Not a hard job at all. Stock the shelves, run the till, and unload the trucks. Pay is a little above minimum wage. The stores get chaotic after holidays, but it’s usually pretty relaxed."
good,"Great place but terrible management. Pay is not good unless ur a manager. Easy work but some days are stressful. Overall enjoyed my time there."
good,"I like the idea that our manager encourages us to get an education or  if you don't have any  education or your GED he tries to find resources that will assist you with paying for school. He is also a Pastor of a church, but he doesn't talk about it a whole lot and he allows you to be you if you believe in God or not. He doesn't treat you different. This is a job and that is what we get paid to do is work."
good,"I really enjoyed my time at this sore, with the exception of management. my co workers and customers were always warm and friendly. great experience despite the minimum pay."
good,"Must have patience to work there. It is an interesting work experience, different faces, people, energy. Lots of different viewpoints and things to learn."
good,It’s a fun but dedicated work area. Its fun working there cause you real only have like 3 or 4 tasks you have to complete before you get to leave and go home but I really enjoyed working there since my school was right across the street.
good,"Average day begin at 6 or 7 am. A basic layout of the weeks events should have been written out the previous week on Friday. A brief walk of the store to ensure that their are not any pressing issues that were not already noted on the work sheets. If there is then add it to the workload.Check emails to ensure their are no pressing issues that need to be assigned. Assign out the projects to all it pertains to. Write out sheets and hand out to associates and my management staff. Follow up throughout the day.  Collect work sheets. plan next days workload."
good,I have no comment on the dollar tree or its policy they gave me a chance but the pay was not enough to support me or my family or bills and there wasn't enough hours
good,"I worked for this company for eight years, opportunity for advancement was rare to none. Yearly raises were only ten cents, which didn't satisfy my worth with the company. "
good,"I loved working at dollar tree, but my manager started not giving me any hours in an attempt to get me to quit. When I put in my two week notice, she took my scheduled next day away from me and told me not to tell anyone I was quitting so that she could tell an assistant manager that she fired me...."
good,Good side job people were polite for the most part.I had a great experience.we all helped eachother out but the hours decreased throughout time.i enjoyed working there.
good,A typical day at Dollar Tree is pretty fast- paced for a cashier.  There are many things to learn about customer service almost everyday.  A 4 to 5 hour shift is what I would work.  Sometimes flexibility is required. Overall a good work experience.
good,"It is a good working pace and environment "
good,Dollar tree wearhouse was a very fast pace and long hours. Good for someone who doesn’t like to work with people. You’re on a head set for 10+ hours a day.
good,"After you are hired you are required to finish a tedious assessment to learn the policies and procedures at Dollar Tree. Then after that you would be led to the front to begin your cashiering training, and what other duties you had to perform."
good,"worked hard to maintain the store, unstable hours. I enjoyed working with my coworkers. In addition, enjoyed building rapport with the regular customers."
good,"It has easy job requirements. Cashier, stocking, unloading truck. However they do not pay their employees enough AT ALL! My advice would be to increase your employments pay."
good,"If it was not for the customers being so rude and trashing the store this would be a good place to work but each night the store is a mess and there is so much to do in so little time and the customers will treat the employees like dirt. It is the customers who make the employees want to leave. The management and other staff are awesome, even the district manager is awesome.  But definitely also have water on you because with all the work needing to be done you will need to stay hydrated."
good,I find it to be a job as any other. There are people who work with you as friends and as workers. If you need to work and be paid then this would be a good place to start. I do not dislike it but as in any other line of work there are some flaws that occur.
good,"Enjoyed the variety of activities. Interaction with customers and employees. Had the opportunity to make more if sales goals were achieved!"
good,"Dollar Tree is an easy job for those who are looking for a easy side job. The only problem with dollar tree is that the stock room at times can get unorganized or to pack with boxes. Also they rarely give out 20 hours or more for one week, unless your a manager."
good,great place to work at if your a student or a student fresh out of school or coming back to work after retirement not many hours to live off or take care of household
good,"Dollartree is a fun & productive environment, I very much so enjoy assisting customers & helping them find what they need. Staff is always on their A game."
good,"Good atmosphere, amazing manager and leads, good work moral all around for all the employees. Optional ot if offered. Easy place to work as long as you werent lazy. Hardest was cleaning an area and someone go through it like a tornado hit."
good,The store was a great place to go shop with everything being a dollor . They sold a great amount of different items from food to bathing and health products .
good,"The management is easy to deal with, the tasks are easy to complete, and it an enjoyable workplace. The hardest part of the job is the customers. Usually there are only two people working during the evening shift which is what I usually did, and because the manager is often busying doing things on the sales floor, he/she can't help you easily when you have a long line of customers. I didn't like that."
good,Great place to work. Manager is easy to work for and does not put too many tasks on you. Customers are easy to please. Wished they paid more and had full time positions with benefits.
good,"The management made the job worthwhile, and the environment made coming into work fun. Management has changed since I left, and therefore my review is no longer accurate, but reviews on Indeed seem to be compulsory and shouldn't be."
good,"Would Run the front end, place cashiers on registers, count in and out the drawers, do morning and afternoon money deposits, unload trucks, stock product, assign stockers to departments.check in vendors."
good,The employees are fantastic. Always have a smile and very attentive to other staff and customers. Willing to go above and beyond. They work hard for very little compensation.
good,Great job they do not provide enough hours for employees and the pay is not great. But it’s a great place to work and a growing company . I would work there agin
good,It was okay because I was going to school at that time and it fit with my schedule. I was always excited to go to work because my shift manager was always fun and relaxed.
good,it was a quick pace work environment with a lot of things to get done in a short amount of time but had a lot of friendly people and coworkers which made the day go by quickly
good,typical day help customers stock merchandise and overall just keep the store clean. Is a relaxed work place learned great customer service skills. Great store
good,"The work is fast paced, with short work hours. The pay is minimum wage but you do more work that what you're getting paid for. The managers are very nice and helpful."
good,A  great place to work and it is all because of the people that work there.  The hours allowed me to have quality of life and there was a lot of employee reward and recognition.  The HR department was all about the associates and the open door policy really existed
good,A typical day working at Dollar Tree is running the register and making sure all customers are satisfied with their visit. I learned valuable cash handling experience as well as customer-employee relations and co-worker and manager relations.
good,It was a great place to work. Nice people to work with. Easy to learn cash register. Great management. Got along with all the employees. Clean store. I had a great time working there when I was pregnant.
good,"I really like the Dollar tree it was very convenient for me, I worked there part time and they were very flexible whenever I needed a day off. In the work area, I had a good time, I always did what I had to do so the time flew by."
good,Really great store to work for close to home always shopping here great things for only $1 ...great co-workers love to greet all customers .. there is always something to do.
good,The company cares more about the sales over anything else. Managers are over worked and have to overcome obstacles almost every day that shouldn’t happen in the first place.
good,ive worked at dollar tree for 9 months. it is busy and slow in the same day but the staff is amazing. i woud recomend working here to anyone who needs a job fast
good,Overall during my time holding this position it was most helpful to me in so many as including building up my speed and focus as a cashier as well as boosting my customer service skills.
good,"It was fine coworkers were nice, costumers where a different story. Didn't give many hours unless understaffed. Its more of a second job type if you are looking for a second one."
good,"Overall, dollar tree was a great place to work and everyone worked together as a team. The customers were our main goal to please and introducing the new items was the highlight of the day to our customers. We had fun but made sure our work was done professionally and within a timely manner,"
good,"Slow paced job,nice to work there mangement is bad but everyone is friendly for the most part the same people would stop by every day and it was a bit to easy to stock shelves and clean up there was alot of dull times."
good,laid back place to work and the regulars are great.  Unable to work full time though and you only get minimum wage.  The managers are great  and the co workers can be quite quirky.
good,"very laid back work area, not the cleanest but clean enough . staff is very friendly and helpful upon new employees. somewhat unorganized and not many workers."
good,"It is a fun and easy place to work. It doesn't require much in the way of needed skill, and everything you can learn will help in you next job. Overall a nice place."
good,Not a bad workplace. Good manager and decent hours. The customers are not too bad and the store itself is pretty neat. No benefits for part time. Pay was minimum.
good,It's a great starter job or for people who aren't willing to work a whole lot of days. Great environment for the most part.Everyone is pretty accepting and I have made friends in parts to having this job.
good,"Friendly environment, Customer satisfaction, Learning new things, Ability to advance, Created safety environment. Adapting to different cultures, reasonable prices and product."
good,"A typical day at work was pretty easy. As a cashier, you make sure everyone gets through the lines quickly and if you need help you can always call someone for backup. Every worker here was so nice and it was the greatest working environment I had ever worked in teamwise."
good,It was a great learning experience .  I was promoted early and was given leeway to be in charge of the entire store in a non-official-store-manager-training when our store manager left.  I was supervised but was running the store and learned many things.
good,Our team at the Parkville store look out for each other and consider each other as family. There are things we don't like from the upper district/ corporate team but as long as we have support from each other it helps us get through the work day.
good,Busy almost all day. some days there was nothing to do during slow periods. If you were good at register you had to stay on register and it was very seldom you were allowed elsewhere in the store.
good,This was a pretty fun place to work for. The hardest part was unloading trucks. The best part was the people. The workplace was always upbeat. The people that worked with were friendly.
good,It was fun working at Dollar Tree. Everyone I worked with were great and friendly and I got along with most of them. It was always fun watching people come in and find the things that they would need and they would leave with a smile because of the affordable prices of their purchases. It's amazing what you find in a dollar store like Dollar Tree.
good,The pay is low and thers no benefits..I believe they ask a lot from their employees with no rewards in return . It’s also crazy rule for employees when purchasing items on or after their shifts
good,"You clean up your work area and get ready to start working , For my first job I learned a lot at Dollar Tree, The management was good. Some of the Workers were Rude but the other workers were very sweet and polite. The hardest part about dollar tree was when customers were using check because at that time I was not familiar with Checks, but being where I am now, I know how checks work. I loved to check people stuff out , it was so fun."
good,Management was willing to work with you on advancement. As long as you did not miss any work. Enjoyed working with the public. Fellow co-workers were friendly. As long as you made the effort to get along with them.
good,I loved this job i ran my own overnight stock crew I had an awesome team we worked hard had fun and got the job done. We took pride in the job we did and the store showed as well as our sales.
good,"I went to work at Dollar Tree when I had been unemployed for several months.  It was the perfect opportunity to work when no one else was hiring. I felt very confident in my position & did a very good job.  With the exception of one Asst Manager, I got along with everyone."
good,"The job was slow paced and relaxed, and the managers were great for the most part, My only issue is that I was not able to afford my own place of living with the pay there"
good,the managers I had at the time were awesome and they worked as hard as I worked. we had a great atmosphere. the people were friendly and I really enjoyed the job.
good,"I do think if I had been under a different store manager I would have had a better experience.  The agenda at the store I was at was not a true agenda,  I feel I would have a better opinion if I would have had a good store manager."
good,"Managers were understanding and accommodating. Simple work. Shifts were all very short; only 5 hours each, which might be a downfall for some."
good,"I worked there for a couple of months as a summer job and although it didn't pay too well, it was a very fun place to work for.  Management knew what they were doing and the store practically ran itself."
good,"It was a job. It paid the bills.I had several managers over the years, who would always come in and make different changes. It was never consistent and the hours would always be different,"
good,The staff at the store was great and management even better.  The customers were the worst and almost make the job unbearable.  It is a great place to start.
good,Dollar Tree was a very fast pace environment. I learned how to use my time wisely. Sometimes dealing with difficult customers could be the hardest part of the job. Being able to work with other cashiers as well as stocker's helped make the job more manageable.
good,good place to work temporarily while attending school. Low pay and only a few hours a week unless management. They expect perfection from employees. Too many people steal from here
good,"I was an assistant manager and you did a lot of stocking the shelves, cash handling, customer service etc. My only complaint was the manager. She was horrible. But everything else was ok."
good,Working for Dollar Tree was interesting. It is a fast paced and productive environment and there is room for growth and advancement. The worksite is clean and for the most part pretty organized. Working at dollar Tree i am able to work as a team with my coworkers or focus on my work by myself.
good,Not enough steady hours.  Great staff to work with. Fun work place. Loved all my managers and co workers. Would love to stay but i need more hours to work. And more set schedule.
good,"Good place to work. Hours are fairly consistent. Quiet atmosphere. Taught me a lot about communication skills, & teamwork. The hardest part of the job is adjusting to the truck schedule. The most enjoyable part of job is the customers. Helping them makes me smile."
good,A typical day at work is always a hard day at work of course because of the business we get each and everyday. I learned the basic for working at a retail store but the management is pretty professional because of the store manger and how he mange the store overall. The hardest part for working for the Dollar Tree is that we normally don't have a full staff working all the time and the store normally gets busy all the time because of the pricing of every item in the store.
good,"a good place to work, opportunity for advancement, a clear representation of what is expected. A very good experience of the retail business. Great people to work with."
good,"The environment was fun, slow paced, and easy to work in. The only reason I had to leave was because they cut my hours really bad. They were family oriented and friendly."
good,The people and the work environment are excellent i learned how to stock in a fast past and timely fashion. Everyone is nice and we all learn to work as a team.
good,"Job is pretty easy, follow direction, use common sense, and be prepare to actually work and advancement is pretty quick.  I see alot of negative reviews and unless you know the situation.Dont be quick to judge. Dollar tree sells everything for a dollar. Of course wages are not going to be 10+ unless you are in management.  Again..Easy job. Key points..be prepare to work hard, follow directions,  ask questions and give awesome customer service"
good,This is a typical retail job with minimum wage pay. I am a people person and I enjoyed that. The schedule was not as flexible as I would have liked but I appreciated the experience.
good,the only thing i dont like about working at dollar treee is bthe pay. some employees should make more such as the stockers and truck unloaders. other than that the job is okay for a jb.
good,"With good work history and a good head on your shoulders you should be fine! I was interviewed and hired on the same day and was working within 3 days! Its a good first job, however for pay I wouldn't recommend this job if you are trying to make a living as a cashier and not as Store Management."
good,"A typical day at work I would clean the front door windows, cashier, run go backs and clean the counters. I learned how to deal with customers. The management was good. The workplace was friendly. The hardest part about the job was doing go backs. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with friendly people."
good,"My day either started in the morning or the afternoon and would continue into the evening around 10-11pm at the latest. I have learned more cashiering responsibilities and stocking protocols. Within the last few weeks, I even learned a little about inventory and display organization.I loved working there and wish I could go back to work there again but now I need more money than they, unfortunately, cannot give me."
good,"Pre work warm up stretching, learn the skills necessary to do your job. Managers are lay back. Everyone gets along but rumors spread easily. Hardest pat is staying to your self and privacy. Most enjoyable get to meet new people and the pay is wonderful."
good,"I would say Dollar Tree was interesting job. a lot to do in a very fast pace, Also its very interesting getting seeing the new merchandise you receive"
good,Working here was always fun and interesting. As with most retail work places there were occasional customers that were not cooperative. If need be I would return for work.
good,A very good work environment just got injured on the job received a pay cut and was forced to quit lack of money for bills and couldn't afford to stay employed at this location
good,Go in and get a cash drawer. If there are customers you will ring up their items and send them on their way with great customer service experience. Then continue to complete any set tasks asked by the manager. Dollar tree has great management. One of the hardest parts is knowing how to deal with and/or conduct yourself with an angry customer. The best part is meeting new people and gaining more knowledge.
good,"Dollar Tree was a great experience for me.  I only planned on working there for a short time, but ended up working there for almost four years.  I loved my co-workers, we were like family.  The customers were great my boss often said I know 90% of my customers because I got to know them, especially the regulars.  Management was great."
good,"Very good job, kind of stressful when there is a lot of customers but other than that I love the job. Very low pay, and get paid bi-weekly but they do give you more hours which that is good."
good,Very hard trying to get stocking done while being main cashier also. The Hardest & least favorite part of the job is unloading the truck in ALL TYPES OF WEATHER. Best part is the Regular Customers and some New ones....Also my Manager & Assistant Manager are like FAMILY !
good,"The management is very friendly. They work with my needs, they let me take an extra break if I need it. The pay isn't that great though so that for sure needs to change."
good,"A typical day at dollar tree was always busy always had something to do everyday no matter what. I learned how to run the register put things back in place to where they belong,learned how to do some manager duties when i became a seasonal manager. The workplace culture was always different, different cultures coming in to shop and always different cultures working there as well. The hardest part about working at dollar tree was dealing with rude customers here and there. The most enjoyable part about working at dollar tree was the customers that come in on the daily with positive attitudes."
good,"Days go fast, you are always busy helping customers, stocking shelves or cleaning store.  Staff are friendly and fun to work with and managers are good and fun to work for."
good,"Being a cashier was okay, but it was a part time job  paid minimum wage and not enough hours, I did like to help assists costumers, handling the cash was fun until at the end of the shift you counting the money and your short or over it does make me feel  good when it's right in the money"
good,I enjoyed people and talking to everyone as they came in.  I believe management did an excellent job of training all who came to work for them.  Their storeroom was a mess. Overall all of the employee's seemed happy.
good,"Sometimes stressful ,always having to try to get freight out as soon ad possible with no hours to work with. Our team tries to do their best to help out"
good,"A typical day of work involves cashiering/stocking registers. Also, stocking aisles and having to help customers as well. Work hard every single minute!"
good,Helping customers and getting to know so much and keeping the store clean. It can be fast paced when we are busy and when you not busy there is something always to do.
good,"This job was seasonal, however during my time there I had the pleasure of working with a great staff, wonderful and understanding customers, and a schedule that really fit me and my family. The management was understanding that everyone has needs and though I worked through the holidays there was compensation and the hours weren't ridiculous. There were few times that the job presented challenges but they gave me plenty of help when needed and instruction that was detailed and easy to follow."
good,Good. Very laid back and chill they dont give out alot of hours but its a job what can i say . its really relaxed i have a good manager and good co workerz
good,It was a great experience fro me for my first job. Met good people and learn a lot from them. Some things were challenging but I did my best to get the work done on time. From that I got the position for assistant manager.
good,"Manager took me off the schedule and never called me, every time i went in to check the schedule i was told it wasnt ready, every time i called to find out my work schedule for the week, i was told someone else would have to call me back"
good,Overall the job is easy. You get to interact with customers throughout the day. Management is right there working beside you to. The pay could be a little better but it's good for someones first job.
good,"It started out as a great place to work until management kept threatening to write you up for every little mistake. Plus if you have to call in because you are sick or injured, you have to find a replacement yourself."
good,"Dollar Tree was a very competitive store all around, many, many, many wonderful products at just a $1.00 plus tax such as candy,  cookies, can fruits and veggies, chips and even frozen products cooked and uncooked."
good,"My experience there was fun actually. I put stuff where they were suppose to go and redecorate the shelf's and satisfied the costumers. "
good,it was mostly always busy it was hard to finish required task due to having to run to the register once it had gotten too busy. in a way it help you learn how to maintain a positive attitude when faced with certain situations because some customers would be a bit rude.
good,"You have to be able to multi-task and work at a fast pace. While on register you have to keep your area clean and the front end stocked, put away items that the customers didn't want and cash customers out."
good,I worked in the evenings after working day shift somewhere else ran cash register stocked and cleaned store made nightly bank deposits when I was acting manger. its a good place to work would recommend it to anyone  wanting a part time job.
good,The restrooms are nasty and the customers always complain that only one restroom is functioning. Both restrooms would work but the manager always procrastinates when he says he'll fix it or put in a work order for it.
good,Dollar Tree Is a great place to work I learned a lot by working there and had a great training program and the people I work for were very nice and helpful the environment was great the customers were great I was there for 7 years got along really well with everybody until my last district manager came on board he's not very knowledgeable in this business I feel that I knew a lot more than he did he was hard to reach out to he did not follow protocol or any of the rules that were handed down to us and he had a really bad attitude I felt like that just wasn't for me I was trying to go somewhere I was trying to do better and all he did was bring everybody down with negativity all the time..
good,Always be prepared for different situations in the work place. Each dollar tree has different work environments and different people to work with. Everyone is unique in there own way
good,The pay was less for the job they wanted you to do as being in management but overall it's an ok job to have I got along with everyone I worked with .
good,"I helped to set the store up, it was new in town at the time.  The manager kept me on as a cashier through the holidays, and I loved being a cashier.."
good,"I am a people person and so that is definitely a plus here. The Dyersburg dollar tree is extremely busy, even on a ""slow"" day!! There is no such thing as an empty store & if it is, something big is happening."
good,"Not-so-stressful job.  Short hours, minimal lifting and stocking.  Daily cleaning and closing.  Taking care of the customers and occasionally unloading trucks."
good,cashier and stocking talk to the customers and assist them in finding their purchases. there were nice people. and I had lots of fun.I wish I could do it again.
good,"Working at Dollar tree was good but eventually you get tired... What I mean is if you have a great team you're good you can accomplish your task and do everything you're suppose to do in your shift. Unfortunately not everyone is the same, not everyone likes to work so is was hard to have a really nice team to work with. And if you don't have your team and you didn't finish your to do list if was a big problem and even bigger if you're a Manager.  Also company management is extremely horrible. If something is broken or missing in the store they take FOR EVER to fix it or to send the item or piece that you need, so the stores sometimes were not running the way the were supposed to, and again the blame was on the Manager even if was not your fault it still was only because you're the Manager in charge that day."
good,I like working for dollar tree but I feel they should invest in their stores more.such as investing more labor. manage stock levels and support store management more.
good,Dollar tree is a fast paced environment with no room for error. The expectations vary per season or with a change in management. The job requires quick adaptability at the highest level. Overall a decent place to work.
good,"I enjoy working here, I just wish you were able to get more hours. The people are great to work with, everyone is really nice as well. So I'm just trying to find a job that gives more hours."
good,"It is hard to give a full picture of this company, as this was a part time position, while finishing my college degree, and looking into a path for long term employment. Never the less as a customer based company, customers and customer satisfaction were the # 1 priority."
good,"It's a hard job to be at night but it allows me additional income and I concentrate on my work, I would like more hours but the sales are slow and do not allow more working hours"
good,"Dollar Tree is an incredibly good job for those just starting out. They tend to hire those who have no prior working experience in retail. If it weren't for that, I would have been looking for a job a lot longer because every other store I applied at was quick to turn me away when they heard ""I have no prior retail experience."" "
good,A typical day was fun and enjoyable - cashiering and meeting customers. Management was great. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing customers happy with the service they had received from me.
good,"Dollar tree is an ok place for a starting job at 18 years of age. Most stores have excellent co-workers and managers, others dont. Check before you apply. "
good,Good starter job for someone just out of highschool. Management works well with outside schedules. Sometimes customer-employee relationships are compromised due to lack of policy knowledge.
good,"As a cashier, I was able to take care of many customers and interact with them. My favorite part was stocking the shelves and getting the store ready for the new seasons and holidays"
good,Working here is okay the only con is that associates (managers full time) are only part time and break time is very short. Working here will not pay your bills. Lines are always long.
good,"Nothing really bad to say, but nothing really good to say either. It had its good and bad days. Most employees were good honest workers. And most customers did not prove to be jerks."
good,"run it like you own it and you will be successful. Difficult to keep associates due to low hiring wage, typically minimum wage. I enjoy working there."
good,"Dollar Tree is a growing company that is great to work for. However has had a big turnover with in the company.  Has a great benefits package. coverage for vision, health and dental. Have been with the company going on ten years. Management for three years."
good,"The coworkers were amazing, and very helpful.  Fast paced environment where you will learn a lot about retail. Alot of stress with customers and work is sometimes not balanced equally among workers but overall it was great experience."
good,"Working for Dollar Tree was great for the most part. The store I just so happened to work at had a respectful and loyal management team. Every now and again I would be asked to go to a different store within my district, they were nothing compared to my store. They all loved to cut corners and break policy to get ahead."
good,"dollar tree has more than enough hours to spare. you need hours while working for them they will send you to other stores to help them out and you have hours every week. they work with you for time off, and also you get great vacation days off"
good,"Just a little job. Good while going to school, morning or evening classes. Guess it all depends on your manager or your employees, but I loved my store and our customers."
good,"I never had a problem here except the pay was to low, i enjoyed my work environment. The people around me. and the customers weren't to bad some of the time. but that comes with the job."
good,"I enjoy my job at the Dollar Tree. My coworkers and managers are friendly and understanding. My managers are flexible with my schedule. During my off time, I am able to study my books for courses and talk with friends. When I am not assisting a customer, I will stock the shelves and assist my manager with anything she might need."
good,"I work everyday but only about five hours, good work environment. I get to meet new people everyday, It Is a very easy job and some of the bosses are really nice."
good,"the best part about this job is the people if you like working with different people then this is the ideal job for you, managers are nice and people are friendly."
good,"This job is a fairly typical retail experience, company was fine. High quantity of shrink from customer shoplifting that we could do nothing about...."
good,Good place to work for anyone in high school or college. Flexible schedule. You wont make a lot of money and the management can be moody at times. Store manager extremely moody and at times rude.
good,Dollar tree is a nice place to work with the right crew. Most of Dollar Tree is about stocking you stock all day long. You got to stay on it with the resets the seasonal. You always have a dead line you have to meet. Other then all that it's a great place to work it's just about how productive  you are.
good,"Fast- paced, Had to make sure to count money correctly, I learned to always greet people as they walk in the door and be respectful. There really wasn't a hard part about the job. Always clean up the store after closing time."
good,"I liked this job, it was simple work, the day to day differences were based on what was needed that day. Management was nice, properly training people. Love the job, but moving on because I need more hours."
good,Great job got a daily production that keeps you busy everyone gets alongs and a great team when need to finish up in the mods have to help out team get the trailer out the yard
good,"had a lot of crazy customers, cause of where it was, but it was fun. I never had a problem with anyone shopping or working. they were all my neighbors. loved it."
good,"typical work day consist of stocking shelves"
good,I would recommend the job cause of the benefits co workers don't know how to work as a Team. Have to unload 18 wheeler all day as well as load its a very high demand job
good,I love working for dollar tree. But it is time for a change in my life. i have worked for them for 4 going on 5 years. i love meeting and helping new customers and regular customers on a daily basis.its nice when we can work as a team to get the job done.
good,"Open and close the store"
good,"Dollar Tree pays minimum wage so that is really bad. Everyone is usually pretty nice. The work is hard and monotonous sometimes, but I only worked part-time and at nights so it was bearable."
good,when you first get to work you have to count a drawer then put in to cash register.then wait for customers to come in I learned a lot on this job.The management was great they worked with you. the hardest part of the job is when people would call off .the most enjoyable of the job was closing day.
good,It was fun working there. People was very friendly. I was a fast learner. I also helped stock the store. On Saturday i would help unload the truck. Worked almost 6 months
good,Its a good place to work the hours are flexable. Managment is understandable. The work is productive not hard to preform tasks.in my better opinion the work is good and enviroment for some one is easy to get a good job and maintain
good,"machine operator and forklift operator, ran crushing machine,weighed material for crusher, cleaned and repaired machines, job was third shift, difficulty sleeping on shift"
good,"If you haven't meet payroll, you'll be the one working open to close. Payroll based off of sales for the week. Truck was easy but did over stock you on some products. Advancement is easy as long as you put in the hard long labor."
good,i liked going to work everyday. the people that worked there were awesome to work with and the customers i helped were awesome too. wish i still worked there
good,"the work place enviroment was sometimes hectic because of demand of product verses the people you sell the product to, it puts a damper on trying to be helpful to customers who also feel as though you do them wrong by not giving them an extra bag."
good,I worked for Dollar Tree for a year and eight months. I have learned a lot and gained experience. I met the most wonderful people and worked with them as a team.Overall it was a wonderful experience working in Dollar Tree.
good,"always moving"
good,"Usually was a cashier in which I was checking customers out with their items and helping those who were searching for certain items. If not cashier, I was a stocker in which I would unload freight from the truck and stock in the backroom and the store."
good,enjoyed really working there there wasnt much to move up or raises. enjoyed new items and displaying items putting up new walls and helping orginizations with donations shifts were short company was very good to me
good,Working at Dollar Tree is a great job which has provided me with good experience with customer service as well as handling money accurately. The work is very doable and the hours are flexible. I have really enjoyed working for this company.
good,Pretty laid back environment that allows for each employee to handle a substantial amount of stock. Very little micromanaging which I really enjoy.
good,Decent job. Just hated there were no security to protect employees. And I hated that the company fails to look more into what's being told to them. A failure of trust and security.
good,"Working at the dollar tree was a great learning experience in retail, and management opportunities . The customers were usually on vacation and it was interesting to hear them talk of where they come from while helping them with questions and assisting in checking them out."
good,i got to meet some amazing customers while working there. there were some managers there that were fair and some that weren't.
good,"I have really enjoyed my last 3 years with Dollar Tree. However like most companies employees feel mistreated to a certain extent. The communication between the chains of command are less than satisfactory. The HR rep for my district was less than helpful. She is one of the major factors for me leaving this company. I tried to report harrassment, and she immediately removed me from training and put me in a position I had no chance of ever being promoted."
good,"This job is very flexible for part time employees with working with their schedule as much as they can, and not strenuous."
good,"the managers are awesome its a stress free laid back work enviroment but the pay could be better i suppose and the hours."
good,"Dollar Tree is a good part time job. The more flexible you are the better. You may not always get the hour you want, but if you are able to go with the flow, you can get more hours. Most of the workers there can tell you where to find what you are looking for. Some have been there for years."
good,"good if you only expect part time hours. great training, but only give assistant managers around 25 hours per week, without benefits. job atmosphere is good."
good,"I loved this job, I'd love to go back but they aren't currently hiring. the only thing I can complain about is the lack of security cameras. Cleanliness is poor. Some times the cashiers can be rude especially evening to closing time."
good,"It was a good place to work, but had issues with overblown egos. Advancement is tough unless you tend to be favored. With hard work for the right people, associates can advance."
good,". Learning something new everyday "
good,"I enjoy working with local customers though they sometimes have bad days. Love the actual work I do such as stocking, building end caps and other displays. Good people to work with most of the time."
good,A typical day at work is working with customers. I learned how to work with people and meet goals. The management team was great to work with. Co-workers were  fun and the hardest part of the job was working with rude customers. The most enjoyable part  of the job was meeting people.
good,"Dollar Tree is a great place to expand your customer service and learn the ways of being a sales associate. Also teaches you how to take control of any given situation thrown your way, especially being by yourself during shifts."
good,a typical day at dollar tree was basically a smooth day the most enjoyable part of my day are my regular customers and the hardest part of the day was when employees call out  what i learn at dollar tree is time management
good,"A typical day at work includes training new associates, stocking freight, and dealing with money for the bank at the end of the night. "
good,Pretty easy work unless someone asks you for help then you get in trouble for not unpacking alot of boxes but they are always willing to help you better yourself.
good,"It was a good place to work at, it had its ups and downs and always busy everyday. People there were always so nice and supportive of you. Management was good."
good,"It gets very busy constantly I enjoy seeing our regulars at the store."
good,"As the part time Assistant Store Manager,a typical day at work would basically be to come in in the evening and reorganize the store.  Assist my cashier with any questions or overrides he/she might have.  I have learned a lot in my job especially managerial skills that i have obtained.  My coworkers were nice and hard working.  The hardest part of the job was picking up after everyone.  The store is usually very messy.  The most enjoyable part was interacting with customers."
good,It was ok but they suck pay sucks. Long hours if management no respect or care about their employees and it hard work for very little pay.
good,"My job is very enjoyable. A typical day can be very insightful. There are many unexpected challenges that may arise, however, the job and management provides you with the necessary tools to be able to complete duties/responsibilities efficiently and without any major stress. The people that I work with are full of energy and are team players. The management is very flexible and dependable.  The hardest part of the job is not having the ability to help customers with situations that are beyond my control.  The most enjoyable part of the job is resolving and assisting customers with their needs.  In this role, I have learned the importance of team work, multi-tasking, being detail-oriented, how to be organized, time management, and how to work in a fast paced environment."
good,Good place to work they help thier workers get what the store needs. They would have you work a lot of hours but some days would get about four. Seasonal time you work a lot .
good,"my typical day included unloading the trucks, putting out new and old stock, inspecting and pricing of products. management was great and my co-workers and I worked great together as a team. the hardest part of the job was finding a place for the product even after its place on the shelf was full so there was little to no back-stock. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting and greeting the customers if we worked over and the store reopened."
good,A typical day involved unloading trucks and sorting products according to location in store and season of the year.  It also required the stocking of shelves and the interaction with customers in a professional and timely manner.  I learned to interact with customers as well as with different co-workers.  Management was great and knew their jobs well.  I also enjoyed working with different people.  The hardest part of the job was adapting to time requirements for stocking the different products in the allotted time.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the different personalities.
good,"Company expects high standards for low pay.  The work turnaround is very high.  Aside from that Most duties are easy to follow and complete, it is just the time required to complete a load of duties for a couple of people working the whole store.  The pay is minimum for both associates and management.  For management, making late deposits could be dangerous."
good,dollar tree was filled with all types of people with different backgrounds. so working here with such a diverse background was interesting.
good,It was a good place to work while in school since it had flexible hours. I worked with customers and stocked the isles when needed. Most of the mangers were great except for one. I only left because the cleaners offered more money and better hours after high school.
good,"good customers, stocking was the hardest part of the job but over all it was a good experience. this job taught me how to work well with others."
good,I love working for this company.  the people and co-workers are a blast to be around.  the closeness to home is one of the main reasons I chose this location to work at.
good,"laid back environment, fun place to work. I am just looking for something with more then 10 - 20 hours a week. hardest part about the job is unloading truck."
good,"I really liked the management,always flexible if necessary.Close to home. Fun place to work and an easy job.I worked there about 4 years."
good,Extremely high paced challenging environment. They will expand your limits beyond what you thought they could be. Due to the business the work life balance is very hard. However a great company to work for.
good,"Management was pleasant and team player . Flexible with work schedule. Great place to start, especially for students attending school."
good,"It's a great place to start and learn new skill. it is fun and great co-workers. A typical day, will be to set the store before openning. Great costumers once u get to know the people that go daily."
good,"Compensation is better than I expected from a dollar store. Overall, the job is very fast-paced and a bit frantic. It requires long hours to be put in for management, but once a staff is trained and on the processes, things become easier."
good,Checking out customer making sure my area was clean. Holiday time redecorate the ideal of the store. I think meeting new people.
good,"Clock in, Serve the People, Grab a couple items from the back for a customer, Blow up some balloons for someones birthday party, Help keep the lines down, seasonal decorations need to be reorganized, stock some stuff here and there, keep the vibe positive and productive, break time, come back to a long line of customers, knock it out and keep the momentum of the day on a great one till its time to clock out. Boom!"
good,"District manager does not work with managers to help make job easier, makes manager work ridiculous hours up to 70 hours a week, and refused to send help when needed"
good,A great place to work but hard to move up unless you are liked rather than your work skills or how hard you work. Learned more about logistics and management than any other job. Unfortunately they promote the wrong people and hire management with no experience.
good,"The people I worked with were great, but I was working there very often during the holiday season (almost 40 hours) and the pay just is not worth it."
good,Fun and exciting place to work in. They have a strong management team. Employees also help each other out. Variety of merchandise to choose from.The price is always right and sometimes you get name brand things.
good,Working with dollar tree has been a great experience in learning and growing as a person. Dollar tree has been my first job so I was happy to learn as I grew with the company and continue to move up not only with the company but in my own life as well.
good,"It is a fast paced job, I have learned a lot from this job from the management. I learned more about how retail works in general. The management is pretty easy to work with for the most part, relatively small management staff lets you get to know each other better. Co-workers tend to be friendly, rarely had any troubles with co-workers. The hardest part of the job is probably being able to keep up a very fast pace all the time. The most enjoyable part of the job has been being able to talk to management about anything, and they tend to be able to work around your busy schedule, such as if you are a college student, or work another part time job."
good,"is a fun environment and fun place to work with the co-workers"
good,Its a good work place to work. You meet new people and learn them on a every day basic. Management staffs down to earth. It's a place that give you a chance to move up in the company.
good,A typical  work day consists of stocking shelves and unpacking boxes that are deliverd to the store site. I learned that it is important to stay on task and keep your head above waters. dollar store is a expanding company in need of serios employees. My manager need to work on being on task but other then that i love my co workers. The hardest part of the jobis communication between me and the manager. The most enjoyable part of the job is being employed.
good,"this employer is fun to for, with great work place moral my only complaint is the compensation. I was in high school when I worked here I graduated and wanted to pick up a couple extra hours and even though the company was hiring for some reason they would not give me extra hours. But nether less great culture and management team."
good,Working here was a joy. I really like working in fast moving environments that will keep me busy and this job did that for me.
good,I worked at Dollar tree during my senior year of high school. Didn't have bills to pay so back then making 6.75 didn't seem bad. its a great first job.
good,"Work day consist of balancing stocking, customer service, and managing. Must be able to multitask and follow company directives. Must be able to accept constructive criticism from superiors. Hard to keep things in order from customers destruction daily. Enjoyable to complete the challenges that are presented daily."

good,"I work in retail processing customer transactions.  My cash drawer always reconciles properly."

good,"Dollar Tree was a great job for someone like me who had no experience in a workplace. Everyone was very nice, and it was easy to pick up and complete tasks. I learned how to become social with customers, handle money, operating a cash register, and work with a team. Management was nice and helped me with any problems or issues I had. A typical day at Dollar Tree as a cashier would include helping customers, cleaning the front end of the store, and handling money. The hardest part of working at Dollar Tree is dealing with irate customers. The most enjoyable part of working at Dollar Tree is talking with customers who were happy and jolly people."
good,Dollar Tree is a very fisically healthy company. I would recomend this company for people who enjoy challanges and taking advantage of oppourtunities.
good,"Keeps me busy, but hours and pay are insufficient. The management is good and the people I work with are easy to work with. Team environment. You learn how to adapt to fast paced work environments and deal with a variety of different situations"
good,"They start you at minimum wage and you don't really just make too much more than that. some of the managers were cool and actually liked to work and knew how to run a store where as some others do nothing but complain the whole shift. How good your day goes really depends on which manager you end up with that day. Kinda like poker, sometimes you win sometimes you wanna blow your brains out. However they did have great flexibility when it came to working around my school schedule."
good,this is a good company to work for would recommend to others growing company bought famliy dollar and is expanding fast per year
good,"A typical work day consist of steady lines of customers, lots of transactions being processed. Cases of frieght being unloaded each hour. "
good,I enjoyed my work at the dollar tree as a cashier because I got to deal with people. The dollar tree has a good enviroment but don't pay enough. It is hard work and they get alote of customers.
good,"Production is very important, fast paced and a lot of walking."
good,"Good job, but pay and resources could be better. Could have more hours for all the things that need to get done in the day-to-day operations of the store."
good,It's always great to welcome and greet people in. I learned how to develop my people skills and how to properly associate with costumers. The managers are always full of energy and always on task. The hardest part about the job is the fact that the hours are very short. But the people there are very polite.
good,"Typical day at work is stocking, cashiering, and cleaning.  The employees at dollar tree have a close relationship. The environment is great with friendly people. I like it there but i am a single father of two and the part time job just wont cut it."
good,"Overall it is good about working around any schedule you may have. Everything else isn't terrible but it isn't the best. Management isn't worth the pay you get. The best part of the job would be all the interacting with people. Hardest part would be the target that get's put on your back, everyone's out for themselves."
good,Everyday at work I was always busy. I had to be very friendly and interactive with customers.
good,learned how to keep inventory on daily basic. Learned how to do a schedule.
good,A typical day at work included a list of what needed to be completed and also side  jobs. I learned about customer service and stocking. Management was never a problem and I always felt as though Dollar Tree as a whole had an open door policy.
good,"A typical day at work was stocking shelves and helping my coworkers run the register when the store was busy. Management was very helpful. We worked together to make the store as efficient as possible. My coworkers helped stock when the store was empty.I watched the managers and learned how to do exchanges, deposits, and how to close the store."
good,"I Come in as If i'm on the register or on the floor, they put me where im needed and then I go to work. I'v learned a lot working there, I now know I can do more then be a CNA. The management is not bad could be better but over all I love it there. My co workers are amazing they help me every time I need something. The hardest part of this job though is when people do not like to cooperate with you. But i Have to say the best part of my job has to be seeing the faces on the people that I make laugh or that I help."
good,Its a great place to work However it could pay more and give more hours
good,"Dollar Tree gave me the opportunity to be a mulit-tasker at work. It enabled me to take care of the customer and my work environment. A typical day at work consisted of small side jobs like filling the display tables back up, or fixing the seasonal section, as well as checking customers out. The hardest part of the job was when I would be the only one on the floor and my line got long, sometimes it would be hectic, but I always fought through it to manage to keep all customers satisfied. I enjoyed engaging with regulars as well as new comers each day, you learn a lot about the human person in general working in customer service. It was one of my favorite jobs so far."
good,I spent a lot of years in retail with plenty of different managers with different managing styles.I learned how to break out of my shell and engage customers and make them feel welcome.I learned how to treat everyone and value their service.I got along with most of my managers and would gladly work with 80 percent of them again.I did a lot of tasks from recovering the store vacuuming sweeping mopping the break and bathrooms.Now I do early morning stock work and assist in unloading the truck every week.Some hard parts were meeting deadlines and dealing with unpleasant coworkers who were only there to waste time.The most enjoyable part for me was working with all kinds of people I made so many friends who are long gone from the store but who I am appreciative I credit a lot of them for making me wanna do my best.
good,"It's a great company to work for. Great Benefits, an unmatched 401k plan, and Paid vacation and Sick pay."
good,"Fun job but, most new employees are only offered 18-20 hours a week. If that is what your looking for I think its a great place to apply."
good,I greet the customers. help customers find items in the store. the management is ok. the coworkers are cool.
good,"Hardest part is trying to get so much accomplished in a short amount of time.Dollar Tree has great expectations that aren't always realistic. Easiest and most enjoyable is working with the staff and customers. Working with our staff is easy as we have a good group of people who care about doing their job. That isn't always the case in some positions, and that is when good managerial skills have to be utilized. Customers come from very diverse backgrounds so is always challenging."
good,"I worked at the dollar tree in Irmo, South Carolina on Broad River Rd. for one consecutive year. It was the best experience of my work life so far.. The people were nice, management was great and my co-workers were awesome. Couldn't have asked for a better group of people to work with."
good,"Place orders assist customers do returns and damages count vault and cashier drawers balance vault"
good,"i enjoyed the experience , worked as a cashier and met a lot of good people"
good,Most people i have worked with were very welcoming and made it an incredibly enjoyable place to work for pay that is what or more than what should be expected for the level of work. although it can be difficult to advance and the responsibilities can become difficult to keep pace with at higher levels of employ.
good,"Dollar tree is overall a great experience to add to your resume. It teaches you how to organize your time, deal with the public, and be able to multi-task."
good,I loved working at the Dollar Tree. The managers were very understanding and helpful when it came to working with my schedule around my academics. My co-workers were great and we worked together well as a team. The job was easy to pick up on and easy to follow. Overall a great job for a starting job.
good,"A typical day at Dollar Tree includes restocking the store, greeting customers 24-7, and assisting the customers.  Dealing with different types a customers will teach you a lot.  You have to know how to deal with certain attitudes and needs.  At Dollar Tree, I've had two head head managers in the last two years.  My previous manager means business when it comes to his job.  In the meantime, I like that about him.  Meeting everyone of his requirements can be kind of challenging, but I manage to get it done.  Overall, I enjoy making sure my tasks are completer before leaving work.  That way, I know my managers will be happy."
good,"When I worked at Dollar Tree it was mostly was working the register, and assisting with customers.  I learned what is expected of me in a job because it was my first job.  My co-workers were very nice, all but one. I never let the one individual affect my work though.  She was the hardest part of my job because she just liked bossing people around and to take advantage of people.   The most enjoyable part was just to help customers in general. I got used to some regular customers who knew me by name. It was nice."
good,"I enjoyed working there , but the pay was not enough.(Based on hours)"
good,Dollar tree has a ton of neat things for only one dollar. The store being so affordable tons of customers would go in to get merchandise they would need. Things from housing merchandise to food items. The store gets packed with people. Especially on holidays the lines are crazy long. Working here i have gained much more experience in cashiering and customer service. The management is just great. The hardest part of the job was trying to figure out at times what some customers were looking for because they would ask in spanish. I know spanish but some of their words were some i hadn't heard of. But with my time working there i eventually picked up on it and my Spanish improved much more.
good,A very nice place to work.  I enjoy the customer contact. Co-workers are very nice.
good,A typical  day at Dollar Tree is spent checking out customers and cleaning the store. That loyal customers are what make a business and earning that loyalty comes from excellent customer service. Management was money hungry and at times didn't think of the customers. Although our store received good reviews our management was what separated us from getting that 5 out 5 instead of 4 out of 5. My co-workers were amazing and diverse making everyday a new experience. The hardest part of the job was inventory and the most enjoyable part was my regular customers.
good,"Mornings unloading products to shelves, placing them neat and organized. Teaming up with a co-worker to get majority of stock unloaded within a hour or less.Greeting customers and assisting them with their needs and desires."
good,"I love working at Dollar Tree. It is a productive and fun work environment. I love the people I work with, and my customers. I love this job, I just need a job with more work hours available to me, and better pay as well. My managers here are lovely people, driven, and goal-oriented. Hardest part of my job is the heavy lifting while unloading freight from the truck. The most enjoyable is helping customers find items in store, and cashiering."
good,It's a very busy company to work for and work never ends. The co-workers are nice and management depends on the store. The hardest part of working the job is unloading the delivery truck you are rush to get it done. I enjoyed helping the customers to make their shopping experience pleasant.
good,"I really like my job.  I like the team I work with.  My store manager is great, however there is limited hours, minimal pay.  I throw freight to get extra hours.  What keeps me there is my clients.  The children that can't what to see e when they come in and the customers that call me by name."
good,"Working was fun having to make announcements for sales and talking with customers and making it a fun way to persuade them to buy and item. I leanred being determined anything can happen and shockingly I got employee of the year because my customers voted for me. I enjoyed greeting them and helping them through the store."
good,we had long closing nights. a well respected job. i lived the job
good,This was a fun job interacting with the customers. Getting to meet new peopl on a daily basis. The management was okay. My co-workers where great. I loved working with each and every one of them. The hardest part of the job was unloading trucks but i made it through. I enjoyed stocking shelves and interacting with the customers.
good,working at dollar tree was a fun place to be at. stocking the store put me in a place where you see want need to be done and to get it done right
good,"I only worked here temporarily during the holiday season, and had to quit when my car broke down."
good,"Not a bad place to work, but allows for little opportunity"
good,I learned a lot from the management aspect of this job. Including how to conduct proper inventory.
good,"I've spent several years working various positions such as Inventory Clerk , Stock Associate and Cashier."
good,"nice managers good breaks safe enviroment"
good,very relaxed place to work. I didn't have to rush to get the job done. As long as I got it done properly. Great with customers. Managers were very very sweet ladies. It wasn't too bad of a store to work in. The hardest par of that job was getting let go. I learned truly to handle money very cautiously. Don't get easily distracted by customers.
good,I have received cashier of the week several times and also stocker of the week. I am a hard worker and enjoy fast paced work.
good,This job stars out ok wen first worked there I was only a cashier but as time pass they notice my hard work and promoted me to asst. Manger it was a good place to work
good,"A typical work day consists of getting on a register, putting up stock and dealing with customers. I have learned about some of the odds and ends with management and how a store works past just running a register and answering phones. As far as co-workers go, it's a decent group, most of us get along, and again for the most part, people pull their own weight. Management could be better. The best part of the job is dealing with customers that are nice and courtesies. and having co-workers that you can get along with, the worst or hardest part of the job is trying to get other things done while running the register and dealing with unruly customers."
good,"A typical day at work would be swift and easy, but dull at times. I wouldn't learn much unless it was something new about the register or how to perform a special type of transaction. The management is very understanding and personable, and they are easy to confront if you have a problem. The co-workers bring a comfortable aura to the workplace and make the day a bit more bearable with the constant flow of costumers :) The hardest part of the job was the very beginning when you are trained and literally needed to work by yourself on the first day. The training I got was literally a 2 minute verbal overview of how to work the register and I was thrown into 6 'oclock rush at Christmas time. This was both stressfull, but very good because it taught me very quickly how to get the hang of being a cashier. The most enjoyable part of the job was being around different people who would simply come up to you and talk to you about their lives and why they were in the store that day. Sometimes it would be positive, sometimes it would be negative, but I always had a chance to share my opinion with them and give them whatever advice they needed with products in the store."
good,"As a manager at this store you mainly would assist customers, stock shelves, and train associates. The store was very small and easy to maintain."
good,"The ""deals"" had its ups and downs. Most of the time, there was always some type of confusion."
good,"I open the store, turn on the registers, get the money in the safe counted and get the opening cashier a till. Then I do the paperwork and check emails. Then I load a u boat for the cashier and myself. I then direct my cashier on the tasks he/she is expected to do. I then work freight untill it is time to start breaks. I ensure the cashier is on task and continue working untill it is time for the second cashier of the day to come in. I then do shift change and the paperwork involved with that. Then I instruct the next cashier on the tasks at hand and what the opener did not finish. I usually have to load another U boat for myself by then and continue working freight until my replacement comes in. Then I go to lunch and when I get back we take out trash. I do a bank run and then the closing manager goes to lunch. I fininsh the paper work and clean my area and make sure everything is put away. When the closing manager gets back I count down my drawer and we change over the safe and deposit. All my cashiers are amazing. I get along with all of them and they work well for me. I really enjoy my job, I feel I am really good at it and efficient."
good,A great company too work for with great people. Was a fun time too set up the store. The only thing I found was that the store was not always the most organized ...
good,Working at Dollar Tree I learned how to interact with customers on different levels and to work a cash register and be good at it. The hardest part is lifting heavy items and the enjoyable part was talking one on one with customers.
good,this job was my 1st intership after i graduated from trade school to become a medical assistant. i really enjoyed it because i was hands on and learning about the field all in one. the staff where very helpful in assisting me with daily routines and procedures. i just hoped i would have gotten the job.
good,"after a busy day you need to fill with this 1.00 price point,merchandising, cashiering, cleaning. a different type of merchandising, with good management support. great co workers always ready for the next challenge. I think the hardest thing was to maintain freight flow, but there was always a lot of great things to get out to the sales floor"
good,"Typical work day at Dollar Tree for me would be goin in at 9:00 am and getting off at 12:00pm,I had some manager that would stop doing what ever they was doing and help out with customers,I enjoy working with the few co-workers that I did get to meet while I was working there they help out alot.Getting hours,seeing customers come in the store and be able to help them"
good,"I enjoy cashiering, and stocking. I loved talking to the customers who come into Dollar Tree Stores. No problems. Just kept to myself."
good,"fine job but, the expectations from corporate are almost unattainable because the amount of hours vs the work load never balance out."
good,"Great co-workers that are easy to talk to. Time goes by fast because it's you and the manger. You get to stock merchandise, cashier, and provide customer service. The hardest part of the job is getting everything done on the apple seed."
good,"A typicle day for me at work was to get my register ready, check to see who was manger on duty and make sure all shifts were covered. I learned how to manage other employees and customer service. I had a good repore with the other managers and co-workers. I learned how to properly close registers at the end of the day and reconcile registers.The part of this job that was the hardest at first was learning how to reconcile registers and keep track of closing duties, but I caught on quickly. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the customers."
good,I enjoyed working here cause I met new people and i love working with the public
good,"stocking, resets, working freight, and assisting customers."
good,"like the co-workers but with no advancements or pay increases, It hard working for Dollar Tree at min. wage"
good,on your feet often.
good,"Seasonal employee, no shows I was called in all the time. Very busy work place."
good,dollar tree in brentwood ca was a fun friendly company to work at.
good,I really enjoyed working here for a short period of time. This was my first job and would love the opportunity to work there again if a position became available.
good,I leanred how to be a great stocker and how to unload trucks that we was getting it was a fun job met alot of new people it was a fun experience but the only thing was it was hard trying to work with people in my way but i love meeting new people
good,"Dollar Tree was a job unlike many other retail jobs. I was not only a cashier, I had to partake in many tasks per shift. One moment I would unload the truck, the next I would restock items, then cashier and put away any go-backs."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is the customers.  It's always nice to be able to help a customer find something that they're looking for and make their day just a little easier.
good,"This job was a nice job. However, I couldn't stay long because I am a college student and I wasn't available for the manager's liking. So make sure you are always or mostly available when applying for Dollar Tree or any other job like Dollar Tree. "
good,"Great easy job that works with you, just not enough pay or hours. They try to work around your schedule, everyone is so kind and helpful.I love it as I said before just not enough pay"
good,Working at Dollar Tree was good most of the time. The worst part of the job was  unloading the trucks. They were horrible and lots of broken merchandise.  Also was not having the people to put the freight out or it was hours. But they sure did want it  out. But we pulled tigether as a store and did our best to get it out. Their were times i worked off the clock.
good,Solid company. Growth opportunities. Management growth. Fast pace. High energy. Patient is needed for clientele.  Team morale . High stress during christmas season. Lots of great stuff for only 1 $
good,I never had any issues with them they made sure we succeeded in any aspect at dollar tree. We made sure our customers were always happy when they came to dollar tree.
good,"Good job for a student if you’re okay with low pay. They don’t promote from within instead hire new people. And not only that the new people make more than you even though you’ve been there for a year and work harder than most and have already had a raise. You have to be desperate for a job. Nobody is paying minimum wage anymore, only dollar tree."
good,This was by far the best job I have ever worked for the place is cheapest to shop at and very much easy to do the work and the hours were flexible with my schedule.
good,Good place to work and advance in the franchise or continue with the general store position and much more opportunities to grow within the company.just apply yourself
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is my customers when they come in looking for me to be there when I'm not. Because they sure tell me when they see me. I've met a lot of really nice people.
good,"This job was cool to have because it allowed me to work overnight witch at the time was perfect for me. It didn't require to much experience and after you got the hang of it, it became repetitive"
good,"I started as an associate working freight and within the first year moved to management. I thoroughly enjoyed my job and I believe most of my associates enjoyed working with me. I didn't pick favorites and treated everyone fairly. If they were disrespectful, I sent them home. I miss this job honestly and if they could meet my pay now, I would go back in a heartbeat."
good,Had fun met great people hard workers manager's Vicky love her other manager made her have mental breakdowns but we helped he let everyone go at the last minute without a head of time i notice.
good,"I'm a people person, and I looked forward to socializing and or interacting with the customers. Co-workers also were helpful along with management and supervisors."
good,Good company to work for. Mostly part time unless you are a store manager or merchandising manager. Minimum wage job with part time hours. Friendly environment with good customer service. The employees work well together and will help with any work related questions that you might have.
good,"There are a lot of opportunity to develop very high skills in leadership, see new places, and work with all verities of professionals. Consultant (after setting conference calls, travel to location for meetups to reassure regional directors and area operations managers that all projects is to be processed and set to company brand standards). Company supplies all necessity to ensure success for each project delivery."
good,They have been kind to me.  Its is my first job in 9 years and I love the atmosphere. The customers are friendly and my manager is amazing............
good,"Need to give employees more set hours and more pay, with benefits. Employees work hard there and deserve to be taken care of by better pay scale for there dedication."
good,Good source for jobs. Friendly staff. Easy workloads. Flexible schedules.. Not far from home. Weekly pay. Friendly customer base. Easy writeup tutorials
good,I started as a cashier and advance to Asst. Manager within 6 months. The pay was very low and the workload was high. We had a fantastic manager at our store who was a pleasure to work for. That made it a great place to work. Our district manager was also a good man.
good,The place is constantly changing and you do more than what your pay will reflect because you will constantly be resetting something in the store if you unload the truck you’ll be freezing or sweating because you have no temperature control in the store.
good,"Store employees and customers were great. Upper management was never happy with store performance, even if continuously out paced larger stores in area."
good,"Working for Dollar Tree is not very hard.  When you are not assisting customers, there is normally stock that needs to be put out so there is normally always something to do.  There are days when it is fast-paced, and then there are days when it is pretty slow-paced as well."
good,"It was a very good job, but when it came to advancement. They always was hesitant. Especially when it came to giving someone a position or a raise. Seem like they didnt want to give it to the people who deserved it."
good,High volume store and you have to keep up with the customer load and process their purchases quickly and correctly.  Often understaffed which is stressful.  But the people I worked with are great.
good,"Here’s my review on working at Dollar Tree. The job experience was good. The supervisor stated the job would be temporary. The downfall about it was that some of the customers were rude. "
good,"Good atmosphere, great co workers. A job you can wake up and go to every day, very easy going and not to demanding. The people who shop there are usually very kind and polite"
good,Pretty simply work. Depending on who you work with depends on the environment of the job. Not too fast nor not too slow pace. Easy work load. Nice customers
good,I loved the job personally. It’s just the part time work that was aggravating. My checks were always bare minimum and although I hated to go I had to find something that would help me to provide for my family.
good,.................Love the workers  fast pace easy job they work with you. Every outgoing ........... easy laid back job helping customers with finding there needs
good,Cool manager kept it reel. Co-worker was very understanding. As always need more hr. But leave to work as a team. Helping each other when need to. The work is not hard. Had to stock the store on the early morning at 5 00am and had to put out a 100 box in a hour. Greet customer as they can in the store.
good,Good place to work. Management was friendly. Coworkers were always nice. It was an easy job to do as long as you had time to get your checklists done. Holidays were the worst because it was always so busy.
good,I was a cashier.  During slow times I would face items and put items back on the shelves that fell to the floor.  Would clean up the shelves.  Would blow up balloons. At the end of shift would vacuum.
good,"We would unload trucks . organize and restock shelves. Paying attention to detail . "
good,"I been with the company for five years and I have learned that team work is very important. It makes our work environment so much easier. The work gets done, merchandise is out we have happy customers with bigger sales"
good,"A typical day at work consisted of, first making sure all the registers had the correct amount in the till before starting it, and then making sure all employees had their tasks ready so they knew what had to be done on their shift. The hardest part of the job was closing, making sure i had all the days amount made set in the system and filed and to make sure it got delivered to the bank at the end of the day and on time."
good,"I have been an employee for Dollar Tree for 3 years and I have received maybe a 25 cent raise, every October every employee no matter if you just started gets a raise the most I have received is 10 cents. I’m currently making minimum wage which is 8.46 per hour only because minimum wages went up to that so they had no choice. It’s horrible it’s only for students or retirees."
good,Would be a good job for someone just starting out in the workforce easy to understand and learn what to do great team work at each store I worked at enjoyed the team I worked with
good,"This is a great place to work, but don't expect to be able to financially support your family on this job. Unless you are at the store manager, otherwise it's just great for supplemental part-time income. Customer service is a must so if that's not your cup of tea, then don't even bother. I love it there, been there a year now, just don't expect much over minimum wage."
good,"Everything was fine at Dollar tree just don’t like that our schedules change every single day, there is so set schedules whatsoever. The pay isn’t good"
good,Ita a great job for just startin out rather relaxed an open to working with you as a team but Ita Hamilton people so expect attitudes and disrespect from employees an other customers.
good,Im a hard working man when. It comes to my jobs I need money so i can pay my bills and dollar tree paid enough but I think I could be getting paid way more
good,My advice for anyone working at Dollar Tree is to find something else to do side job wise and adjust your work hours at dollar tree if possible which most likely is.
good,I've enjoyed my job at Dollar Tree. I have a great manager and awesome coworkers. Working there has really helped me come out of my comfort zone and given me skills that I can use/take with me to future jobs.
good,"The store I worked at was one of the best in our region, yet we still weren’t given incentives. They only promote from within, so if the person ahead of you doesn’t intent on advancing, then you’re stuck."
good,Depends on where you land inside the job there are mouthy people everywhere. Also the people are very rude and don’t care what comes out of there mouths but there are some good people and management needs some help.
good,"Typical day of work was steady paced."
good,"I really enjoyed working here. The customers made my day. I had more nice customers then difficult ones. I don't know who made the rule that "" customers are always right"" that's not true."
good,"it was good working there as a internship, could have been better but"
good,"When you clock in you get right to work stocking shelves, filling up U-boats. Unloading a semi of 1500-2200 cases a week. Really fun place to work and easy going."
good,"Loved the hours I worked.  Never was a dull moment where I didn't have anything to do as we were constantly shelving product, running the register, or assisting customers. The atmosphere is Great!!"
good,"All the employess are very helpful and friendly and great to work with.  They were willing to give me a chance at the job when i hadn't been able to e"
good,"A typical work week consisted of stocking shelves in the isles that were the most empty. The busiest isles were Snacks and Chemicals. On Fridays, my co workers and I would unpack the delivery truck into the backroom along with organization, this took about 3 hours. The delivery truck that brought frozen goods was unpacked on Tuesday morning. The trucks were the harder part of the job because the backroom was cluttered. The more enjoyable part of the job was stocking he shelves because you could see the progress you are making."
good,"Nice place to work, but low salary to live off this day in time, you can not live off minimum wage today with the amount of hours you get"
good,If it was my choice I would put more towards sales & customer service. They want you to do the same thing 4 different ways. They have forms & paperwork for EVERYTHING!
good,Ita fun place to work.. Love our customers.. Stocking the floor is pretty easy. Willing to show whete thinga go and how things are done.. Very comfortable work space
good,"Management and staff are friendly. Pleasant work environment, it is not stressful. Starting pay, however, is minimum wage. Which I didn't mind since this was only a Summer job before I headed off to College."
good,The managers at the store I worked at fun and would change your hours if the schedule didnt work for you. Only one cashier would be working but the manager would help if it got too busy. On average I would be given an 8 hour work.
good,When I worked at Dollar Tree it was okay working there and got along great with all workers and customers ... most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers in need... the hardest part wasn’t so bad.
good,"This was the first company I had worked for. They taught me several skills that I hold onto and continue to build on. Would recommend as a first job, as it is easy but manageable."
good,"From working at dollar tree I was able to gain more communication skills because of the interactions I had with customers. In addition to this, I learned how to work quick, while making sure everything was done perfectly and organized."
good,"Restocking items, operate cash register straighten out store. Help customers find what they want and show them other items which might interest them. Tell them about store specials."
good,"If your looking for mindless work for little pay you've got the right place. the hours are usually short but full of things to do, no one will breath down on you but you sit and do nothing either. Oh yea, and its convenient to buy things there seeing as how everything is a $1."
good,Dollar Tree is a quick paced work environment with a good work culture and can give you easy money handling experience. .The management is good. The hardest part of the job is when the other person is on their lunch and you are all alone
good,fun work place good customers clean store no lunch room management was respectful and very understanding.team work we were like family that truly cared for one another.
good,Working in dollar tree is a good place to work and the people are great i enjoy it very much the only issue would be the pay and no actual benefit with the job.
good,"Other than the transportation issues for me, it was a good job. The manager was nice, the co-workers were nice, I felt accepted. I was a fast learner, and they knew that I could handle what was thrown at me."
good,It was a very normal retail job. The management needs some work though since kn my very first day they didnt pay attention and schedualed me for an 8 hour shift when it was only supposed to be a 4 hour shift.
good,Like working for Dollar Tree but would love more hours and would like the managers to communicate better I feel like there's no communication between the employees and managers they call you at last minute to pick up shifts instead of giving you enough time to get to work and some of the managers wants you there right when they call which is impossible sometimes especially when you don't have a car so that's something I wish they would work on
good,The store is messy most of the time. Needs better management. They did not gave me enough hours to work because 5ey had hired too many employees at the time.
good,"This is a job that does not pay competitively with the rest of the area.  Pay is minimum wage at 7.25 an hour and truthfully that is not enough for the amount of work you do there.  I loved working there though because this was my 2nd job and it afforded me extra things in life but because I loved the Dollar Tree that is why working there was not an issue of hard work, it was more me serving my customers and knowing them by name and getting into the heart of what the Dollar Tree really stood for.  We offer good prices on items you can use in your home and it just made it fun overall.  But to have it only as a source of only income, I could not do it."
good,"Working at Dollar Tree is a great starter job for someone looking to dip their toes into retail for the first time. A typical day at work will include ringing people up, showing people were to find things, and straightening up the store when things aren't too busy. Things weren't that difficult and it can be fast paced at times but if you are good at prioritizing activities and your time, you should do just fine."
good,As long as you are a hard worker you will get places there. Alot of turn over because most weren't willing to put in the work. Tough boss but still a great boss.
good,"I love shopping at Dollar Tree. As far as working there goes, it was just okay. It's an easy job that's a solid option if you're looking for a second job. Whether you're a stocker or a cashier, you really don't have to think much - just smile and help customers and do what you're assigned to do. The most difficult part of the job is fitting all the items on the shelf because sometimes there's simply no room to put things. Other than that, easy stuff."
good,"had to make sure every thing is done. you only get two asst, if the is meet their quote, if not you get one asst. manger you have to make sure every is on time or working."
good,It was a pretty dece y job just not enough hours and needed higher pay for as much as i was doing for them that wasn't my job or responsibility but they work with you and it is fun at times liked the fast pace made the days go by quicker
good,"A fast paced company to work for seasonally.I found it useful at the time for my temporary employment needs. The manager was helpful ,and overall the employees were friendly.I enjoyed working on the floor stocking as well as helping with light janitorial tasks that were assigned to me during my employment there."
good,I didn’t like the management too much but in all it was pretty fair quiet fun and the team work was great. I like the people who came to the dollar tree love greeting and meeting new people
good,The company is very helpful with training and making sure you are well versed in what is expected of you. The shifts are only 5 hours unless you're management and then they are 8 hour shifts. There is always something to do and it really is never slow in the store. You will encounter many friendly customers and the management is always helpful in anything you may need to perform your job correctly.
good,I have been a cashier for over 5 years and its really not that hard. Just pay attention to detail and how many items you have. Customers are always going to have questions and you have to be very knowledgeable about the products in store and where they are located. It will help out in the quickest ways.
good,It starts out slow then as the day goes on it starts to pick up the pace through out the day. When we needed breaks there was always someone up front when the other person was on break.
good,Enjoyed meeting new people everyday... I didnt like the crew because they were always calling me for other people shift. I would rather be scheduled the hours.
good,"I was a cashier. I also swept, mopped, vacuumed, stocked, and organized. I loved this job. I started off with at least 20 hours a week, but they started to lower my hours and I ended with 5 hours every two weeks, then i had to relocate, so was unable to continue working there. I would definitely go back if I was promised a minimum of 20 hours a week."
good,Dollar Tree in Farmington had good management and decent pay for someone who just needs a part-time job for extra money on the side. The job itself is super relaxed
good,i left cuz i was looking for more hours .they gave very few hours a week not enough to live on. nice place to work if it is your first job. looking to get more experience in the world .
good,Fast paced environment. Little imput on processes of the business.  Directives are already set on all processes and merchandising plans for all stores.  Advancement opportunities always available.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Dollar Tree. The stock given was a new experience, that was novel for me. I learned a lot, about the daily running of store. Caught an error made by auditor."
good,"Stocking Associate (Intern)"
good,"Dollar Tree was a great place to work for me, albeit the pay was very low. As a high school student at the time, this wasn't a big problem for me, as I was just looking for a job to help teach me how to work hard and get a good work ethic. The job is very low-stress, and the management was awesome to work with. The hours were relatively flexible as well."
good,"It's very fast paced and they basically throw everything at you at once. October through December is super busy, with all of the the upcoming holidays."
good,Fast paced but a great atmosphere. The training was more than sufficient and like retail jobs it can be demanding on home balance life. minimum of 48 hours per week.
good,"Receive payment by cash, check, credit cards, vouchers, or automatic debits. "
good,"I was able to work when I wanted to. I was also able to get Sundays off. I meet with different kinds of people, with different interests. Fun, friendly environment."
good,Working at Dollar Tree was not a bad place to work a little stressful because management wanted it to be a training store so things had to be more perfect which made me a little stressed.
good,Its a great place to work. Friendly workers and meeting new customers daily was my favorite part of working there. Pay was good as well but didn't get many hours.
good,Dollar Tree is a great place to work if you are only looking to work a part time job. Company does not allow enough hours for more than 2 employees per store to get more than about 20 hours a week.
good,I enjoyed working with my team and customers were the very best part of the job.  Even had regular customers always coming to my line.  Worked flexible hours and would work extra hours for my team whenever they needed me.  Did not have benefits for part time.
good,Besides the constant shop lifters stealing candy and some other stuff the job was what you expected and decent. Checking out customers. Stocking and cleaning. Constantly under staffed so a lot of work to do but it's doable and manager always helped out.
good,"time goes by fast, extremely high paced, need to know that going in that every day is going to be stressful and yet fulfilling. one know's that when day is over, you did put in a full day's work."
good,"Clocked in "
good,As an Assistant Manager your responsible to basically clean the whole store on your own your given one cashier for closing store and your expected to do everything while cashier is responsible for front end of store but if you have a cashier that is lazy you have to maintain that as well...But lately I have seen they are not as concerned with maintaining of store.
good,I was a cashier/stocker at Dollar Tree. It's a good place to work if you want a part time job. The management is good and everything's pretty simple and basic. They are fair about distribution of hours and will work with your schedule. Very methodical and repetitious. Dollar Tree is a good place to work.
good,"Company is good for a new learning exzpereance not for a career move."
good,"Great management, nice staff, and well maintained store. Flexible hours are a plus, and benefits are expensive. Hardest part is going to be leaving, cause every day is a good day when working there."
good,"You typically get straight to work and the majority of the employees at this store are hard workers."
good,"During the time i've worked at the Dollar tree i've enjoyed working with the other employees I work with from different shifts. We learn to work as team, and have our responsibilities done at the end of the day. Mostly I enjoy the customer service part of my job where I get to interact with other people that give their input on our work performance."
good,It's a good place to work if you are looking for extra cash and part time. It can be fun and stressful at times. There's always something to do.  They have a pretty cool management team.
good,"My overall review of working at dollar tree was not bad, i learned how to organize my jobs in a timely manner, interact with the general public in a professional and friendly manner. I learned here that management of the company at which you work is the overall backbone and support system, if management goes against others the work place will have a overall bad management and vise versa."
good,It was a well paced job. The hours were flexible and manageable. I also enjoyed working with co workers. Job mostly consisted of stocking shelves ubloading and loading trucks and making sure store was clean and presentable. So in summary i would recomend and consider working again for Dollar Tree
good,I really enjoyed  working there I just didn’t make enough money and they really didn’t have benefits I just wanted something better for me I wanted a career
good,"Dollar tree is a good introductory job into retail, at least that’s what it was for me. It was my first real job I took while going to community college. Still living at home at the time it was more so spending money for me as I had very little bills to pay. I worked with a great store manager who ran a great store. Unfortunately being a cashier or even assistant manager at dollar tree, it’s not able to be made a living off of because of pay rates, in my opinion, unless maybe you were a full time assistant."
good,Stay focused and courteous be diligent and enjoy it lots of different people to meet and see have fun with helping actually enjoy it sometimes at least
good,when i worked here i was cashier then manager and so on. But there was a lot of frustation because people wouldnt always show up for their shifts and we had to act as security too. It was stressful and didnt quite seem right for the amount of $$ you were getting.
good,"The Point Pleasant Dollar Tree has a steady influx of customers, and is very busy for holiday shopping.  I enjoy getting to know our regular customers, and meeting all the different new people who come to shop. The best part of the job is meeting so many people, and the hardest part is stocking the shelves while running the front cash register."
good,"Working at Dollar tree, it is all about the customers; from what they like to buy to  what they argue with bringing back. Stocking as quickly as possible while keeping the shelves neat and organized is tough, but doable. The hardest part is when a customer believes their right and you have to stop yourself  from wanting to roll your eyes and tell them exactly how they are wrong and to not have them tell you how to do your job."
good,"If you're looking for a first job or a way to get back into the workforce where money isn't a worry, I'd recommend it, but otherwise it likely won't support you. I recommend you have thick skin, too, because some customers can be brutal."
good,"really enjoyable job. I was a seasonal worker so after christmas, i didn't have a job anymore which was really depressing. Especially since I was broke during the holidays."
good,A typical day was simple as long as you knew how to quickly check customers out and wisely time your tasks you are a signed for the day. In my old store we gave our employees task cards and you had to either finish all 5 completely or finish 3 out of 5 big tasks and finish the last 2 small task first thing when shift starts.
good,"Just needed a job when I started, but rapidly moved up in the company. I have worked in 2 different states while employed at Dollar Tree. I enjoyed the first 2 years, however after transfering found it harder. A great company all in all, just find a store you mesh well with."
good,"Typical days include content moving of weight and product."
good,"Dollar Tree was my very first job I got right after I graduated high school. It was close to home and not a super populated store so I thought it would be a good fit, and it was! I was the youngest person working there, and my coworkers and managers were always very friendly and reasonable. Most work days were somewhat slow, not too many customers, and on those particular days I would spend part of the time restocking shelves. These were the best days. However, on days where we busy, it would be messy. We would usually only have 1 or 2 cashiers working the same shift, so on busy days the lines would get very long and it got stressful. Still, even on those days, it was not so bad. I learned a great deal about customer service and management. Would recommend!"
good,I worked at Dollar Tree while going to college. They were more than happy to work around my schedule and lenient when I needed extra time off for classes. Great for a first job!
good,I was nice working at the Dollar Tree. Seeing people come in just to by a few things end up spending more than what they had expected but they still had a smile on there face . the only down side is if your store don't make the daily quota you are sent home without pay .
good,"Good company as far as benefits and job advancement goes but management and turn over is not good. A lot of resets, too much stock not enough payroll for the hrs to do all of it."
good,"i would make sure i have my till counted and ready to go. make sure floors are sweep up, mopped and the aisles are organized. kept on task, clean every garbage can at the end of the day. counted money we made that day and closed up the store. make sure customers are finding what they need. i loved organizing each aisle especially during the seasons. the hardest part of the job would probably be the standing."
good,"My experience at dollar tree is quite a good one, everyone i work with is great, which makes my work day that much easier. A typical work day includes cashiering, blowing up balloons, stocking the front lobby, and recovering. (plus taking the trash out and replacing the bags, and cleaning up your register on days you close)  All pretty easy things, it can be stressful when it gets busy and it's just you and a manager though, (closing and some mornings) especially when someone wants 20 balloons and there's a line going up the aisle. the hours that are assigned depend on how sales go one week, if we sell more this week, we get more hours the next, so even though slower days are more relaxing and easier to get things done up front, it means you might have to worry about your next paycheck."
good,after working at the dollar tree for less then a month I was promoted to assistant manager. I believe that they put the customers first always and treat the customers very well
good,"Fun place to work at. Most positions are part-time, except for management. Can be stressful sometimes. Can become busy, and hectic at times. Sometimes you find exclusive items"
good,Dollar tree is a good job just can't get caught up with employees or too friendly cause that how drama starts. If you work hard do your job you get hours and the check will show for it
good,This is a great first or beginner job. It does give you the opportunity to move up in the company if you're doing well and they have openings then you can apply for managerial positions.
good,Kept me busy the store was always messy not enough hrs to clean and fix the store.management gave me my job list and left me alone never bugged me that's what I liked about Dollar Tree
good,"If you’re just starting out in the work force, than dollar tree is a good place to start. Pleasant customers, and staff. Along with a schedule that is flexible."
good,"Typical day at work consist of making the customers happy and exceeding their expectations. I have learned to be prepared to multi task everyday, Managing employees is second nature to me. Hardest part of the job is delivery day but Im pretty sure thats everywhere Most enjoyable part of the day is rush hour mostly between 11-7 its gets very busy and its time to buckle down,it gives me a rush, I love it!"
good,"Being my first job, I was glad to have finally gotten my foot in the door with Dollar Tree. It took a little while to learn all the ins and outs of job, but it became easy to pick up. However, I cannot say I miss some of the ridiculously large orders to process or the inconsistent work schedule. Otherwise, this is a good place to get started; just try to get a full-time job if you can."
good,"Was a good job, fun environment and great co-workers. Our new store manager was impossible to work with but other than that I loved the job and wish i could have stayed with the company."
good,This Job was good for learning how to stock areas and practice you're organization skills.This Job was also good for you're Customer Service and communication Skills.It also taught you how to deal with customers and people in general. It also taught you how to maintain a full inventory so you can continue to put out product.
good,Good Company rapid Growth opening new store  nation wide.  You can learn and expand your career to any level you desire.  This company is progressive with tools to run the business model.
good,I loved working there but I was only getting paid minimum wage and couldn’t do it no more. They need to raise there pay rate. Plus my last manager there was very disrespectful
good,It is a friendly place to work but not exactly what i am looking for. I have met many great workers as well as customers. The store is kept to a high standard and it shows.
good,Enjoy working with public. Have done Retail for over 25 yrs in Management. Like my job but feel they need more payroll to get better results. Employees feel their work is never appreciated.
good,"This job was a great stepping stone to get back to work after staying home with kids for a few years.  I worked at this job for about 6 months and the only real problem was the limited available hours, 20 or less hours a week unless you are a member of management."
good,"Even as a manager I was often assigned as a cashier, stocking shelves was my favorite job.  Considering you had to be at least 18, it should pay more."
good,"cashing out  customers/fast paced environment. the work place consist of the person being able to ring up customers fast ,otherwise customers start to get irritated. other than that job is pretty self explanatory"
good,"On an average day, the lines are slow so it is usually hard to find things to do to pass the time. During the rush hour, lines are backed up and people tend to get antsy."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Dollar Tree to a certain extent, the store at times felt a little sloppy. Overall it's a good place to work if you're looking for part time work."
good,"During my time with dollar tree they worked around my school hours and was polite........           "
good,"Decent enough job that was not too easy or too hard. Come to work and do what is expected of you and there will be no problems. Everything is pretty straight forward, and everything is $1."
good,"Enjoyable , sometimes stressful ,a lot of work to be done , many sections to choose from ,new items every week "
good,I only left here because I got married and moved to a different city with my husband. This was a great place to work. They treated you well and the management was fun.
good,For the past two years our company has grown so the workload have changed for the better. We sell more products and have been given a freezer with food like the local grocery store. The freezer has grown our store tremendously with business. The hardest part is staying with a company for many years and they only allow a 10 cent yearly raise. This amount of money is not enough to raise a family on!!!
good,I had a lot of fun working at Dollar Tree for almost 5 years. It was very productive and I truly treasured my co-workers. I enjoyed unloading freight the most.
good,My managers were awesome but Dollar tree is a temporary job. It is not a job where you can be promised a steady salary and great pension benefits. This job is for teenagers that are in need of getting their feet wet in the work experience and be able to pay for their train fare or food. Besides that Dollar Tree did provide me the opportunity after working for them for 2/3 years to become supervisor but one thing I never liked was the store manager's favoritism
good,Dollar tree has need for advancement. they have a huge work load and no hours to give employees to help. Need better upper management training as well
good,I have enjoyed my time spent here and feel as though I have learned a lot more in my time here compared to other retail jobs. I feel as though I am very well suited to many more job openings than before my employment here.
good,You don't come across much Dollar Trees that are clean friendly and overall great. Managers work with you on training and getting to know the full layout of the store. do's and don't
good,A typical day at work is I would show up get the paper work all ready for when the truck arrives to drop off the stock. I would also prep the back room for all the new stock arriving on that day. My manger was the best she was a lot of fun to work with we always had a good time working with each other. The hardest part of the job is while the truck driver unloads the stock taking it to the right spot in the back room and not having it back up on the conveyer belt.
good,"Dollar Tree is pleasant work environment for the most part. The staff is friendly, and most of the customers are regulars. Its a fast paced environment, especially during holiday seasons."
good,I thought my time their was good. Good management communication . Are willing to work with u in difficult times . Employees are very friendly . Make u fill like part of the dollar tree family
good,A typical day was coming in and checking out the people and making sure the place was clean. Sometimes you had to put displays together when there was no one to check out.
good,there is always something to do like clean up in aisle the bathrooms . help people out to look for what they want or just put everything neatly where its supposed to be
good,"I was a morning stocker who worked 6am to 12pm, monday thru Friday. I mainly stocked merchandise and zoned the aisles. I liked the schedule a lot, and I liked having a simple job."
good,"For the most part I had fun working there, but there were some rough days as well. The company itself is a good one to be employed with, great benefits."
good,Working at Dollar tree allows for an easy paycheck and consistent work. With very little confrontation and fair management its adequate work for the general population.
good,i love working there but it is part time i want something full time and want to have opportunity to excel and here you can't excel  i love where i am at but want more to learn from and more advancement opportunities
good,I really enjoyed working for Dollar Tree. working for Dollar Tree was a learning experience. there were great manager assistance. Co workers were always friendly.
good,"Great company to work for if you enjoy a fast pace."
good,I love working with the people at the dollar store customer service is great being there or coming in as a customer very reliable when their are hours available about offering them to those who need them
good,"Store opens at 8 am and its not stop from then. The tree is very busy but the first thing they tell you.. TAKE YOUR TIME MAKE SURE YOUR MONEY IS RIGHT. The managers all were very helpful and understanding. Loved working at the Dollar Tree, just not enough hours per week. All the Employees helped each other.."
good,"I worked at Dollar Tree and while it wasn't the most glamorous job, it was nevertheless a job. I was treated well and I found the tasks to be easier at the same rate of pay as similar jobs. We kept a good job of keeping the store clean and earned great reviews."
good,"Both the management and employees are great to work with. Dollar Tree is a great start to the retail industry! While it can be face paced, you do have your down time too! Very nice and lenient management...can be stressful dealing with some customers, but that's anywhere with retail. But overall you have great customers! Nice place to work at, everyone works great together. You learn both stocking and the cash register if you go for the Cashier position. Very easy to use the cash register. Overall, I would recommend this position to someone who either needs a part-time job, or wants an easy start in the retail industry!"
good,Wait on customers and ring up their items. Stock front end with supplies and merchandise. Balance cash drawer at end of shift. Train new employees. Do price checks.
good,"I loved how busy you stayed, never a boring day. you always had something to do. that for me was awesome, i like to be productive. and i liked all the interactions with the customers."
good,I enjoyed working here with the team i worked worked with very enthusiastic energetic  people always eager to work as a team effort to get the job done quicklyand safely .
good,Working at Dollar Tree was an amazing experience they are very flexible hours and very understanding I would totally recommend applying if you are first-time job holder
good,"the managers were great, always had fun on my shifts, all of us who worked there got a long very well, close to home, very flexible with the hours, great environment"
good,"It's always short staff so it gets really busy. It's fast paced and little time for short breaks. "
good,"I like to work at Dollar Tree I interactive with a lot of people, give them greetings, make them laugh, help the customer find their needs. Every day stocking and organization, cashier and cleaning the aisle. the hardest part is wake in up at 4:00 am to go to work at 5:00 am. I have good communication with my coworkers and enjoy the environment."
good,The people are nice and the hours are flexible. The only down side is that they don't give you many hours. It is a stress free environment and the managers are understandable
good,"Where the right clothing."
good,"Fun to enter act with customers, stocking, cleaning. It was a very relaxed place to work. Learning to set up seasonal displays. Helping with special transactions."
good,Just work the whole day had broke but it was ok to work there.I learned a lot how to handed money. Clean my own space. Help everybody that need it. The management was good I like all of them.
good,"It can be fast paced at times , depending on the location and volulme of sales the store does. Of coursr Chirstmas is the busiest time.Always something to do though time went by fast."
good,"The job was very enjoyable.  My work hours was very flexible ., but didn't get a lot of weekend off. The hardest part of the job was unloading fate. Enjoyed stocking the store.  I would close the store 90percent of the time"
good,It is an okay environment to work in .You didn't get paid for the amount of work you do. As an assistant manager you do so much for so little. You almost basically do the store manager's job.
good,This is a great place to work. however the pay isn't all that great but for starting out fresh out of school for myself at the time it was a great job
good,"Working at Dollar Tree was an excellent way to use my organizational skills. The fast pace was right up my alley. The customers were friendly and helpful. There was always something to clean, organize, stock, inventory or check out. Working at Dollar Tree helped with the knowledge and experience I needed for when I moved to Dollar General."
good,"i liked the job wish it have lasted longer but, it was nice. I just wish the summer didnt end so fast. Because that was a teen summer job program thru the Smart Center"
good,team work is a must. never had a better work experience. Employees would get jobs accomplished while making the work day enjoyable. Cashiering is my favorute part of any job i have had. i take pride in doing my job well and appreciate constructive criticism and praise for doing a good job. i am oretty goid at multitasking and that is a must at 5he dollar tree.
good,"Management and coworkers were pleasant to work with. Job was not labor intensive or strenuous. Job was easy enough, handling the cash register and keeping the store clean."
good,Easy start up job for anyone looking for work easy going employees and management. Sometime on and off waves product placement easy to read see and know what the buyers want.
good,"I feel this work environment is not for females. It is a face pace, physical work environment. Working in a warehouse gets really hot in the summer. The benefits were great though."
good,A typical day would start off slow until people start getting off work around 5pm thats when it usually starts to get busy. Learned how to use a cash register and communicate with customers. Most enjoyable part of the job is making customers feel happy by greeting them and helping them find what they're looking for.
good,"Where as I worked the evening shift, there was always store clean up and making nightly deposits, cashing out the cashier's draws and counting the safe."
good,I loved working with the customers and putting a smile on there face everyday. it is an overall cool place to work. just didn't like the constituency of it.
good,I liked working at dollar tree. Was a fast pace job and friendly customers and employers not enough pay to be excatly and not enough hours i enjoyed working their but needed something better for me and my family
good,"It's an OK job, but you it's not the kind of job I would recommend to someone. It's a stressful job if you can't get anything done, but other than that the job is OK to work there"
good,"It is a fun, fast paced place to work.  You get to see all the new $1 merchandise first.  Everything in the store is $1.  The only problem is the pay which is minimum wage and no benefits."
good,"I think the 1st manager I had there had her favorites, so my hours varied. Then we had another manager come in. I didn't like his attitude much, he was more serous than I was used to. But he was a good manager. I only left this job because my hours were low and I was offered another job with better hours and pay."
good,"This was just a get up and go type of job for me. I had just moved to Richmond and needed to find somewhere to work. At first I was scheduled several hours per week. After a while it went down to 4-8 per WEEK that I was working. I did have a small period where I had some health issues and the manager did work around them. "
good,Dollar Tree is a decent company to work for. Reason why i'm looking is because I would like to continue my opportunities to work for a company to climb the latter and at this point for as long as I have been there that isn't an option for me .
good,"The work load fluctuates depending on the time of year. during the Christmas season a shift can be very busy, but during quieter seasons there is a lot of down time. on the whole it is an enjoyable job if you like working directly with customers."
good,"Working at Dollar tree was fun, I received a promotion within 1 year, I enjoyed my position, my responsibility. Sometimes my hours were outrageous but I signed up for that."
good,"The work at the Dollar Tree is easy. The cashiers work four to five hours shift, but can be asked to work longer. Also they help stock the store and can be asked to help with the truck."
good,"I absolutely love this job. It can be hectic at times, especially during the holidays, and somewhat stressful. The pay isn't the greatest but overall it's a fun place to work."
good,Fast pace and fun place to work.very busy at times. Great managers and very organized. Good hours to open and close. Very good items to purchase from.
good,Great store and good company to work for. If one works hard there are plenty of opportunities for advancements. Huge growth opportunities for the right person.
good,Not acceptable they don't care about you when they hire you they don't tell you that you will only get 10hours or less but the job is laid back I always have a good day at work
good,I kept the store organized and clean. Restocked the store when its items are sold out. i enjoyed working for this employer just because they appreciated their employees.
good,customers are basically teachers & nurses we have a hospital right next to us. customers help other customers if they need change or need help to the car the customers help out.
good,"Fun, great staff, and always great customers. When every thing is a dollar twenty five and new stuff always arrives. Keeps it interesting as well. I've had my fun, time to move on!"
good,At dollar tree I really used my people skills as a cashier which can really help in a high stress environment if you have a upset customer or something like that you have to really know how to stay calm & handle the situation with a collective manor. I also worked alot stocking shelves and zoning which is take items that have older dates & moving to the front that way the item gets off the shelf before its exoeration things like this are very important.
good,I love working here because I get to be around different types of people. I love all of the people I work with and the environment. I get along with all of my co-workers.
good,I would ring customers up and when not busy I would stock the shelf. I would help customers find what they were looking for. then ring them up so they could go on with their day.
good,I like it at dollar tree. Everyone was great to work with and work together to get things done. Managment understood the meaning of family and having to balance work and home
good,"I had a great time working there. I allowed the flexibility to work overnight, along with my normal schedule. Management did a great job at recognizing my accomplishments."
good,"The management and co-workers are amazing- as is most of the customers. Unfortunately, the convenience of the store is also its downfall.There is a lot of theft due to how close the homeless shelter is."
good,"Helpful for starting off as a first job. 4-hour shifts are convenient. Management of resources were slightly lacking, as not many utilities necessary for upkeep of the location were available."
good,enjoyed working there.. there for a while seeing old and new faces everyday.. some you could laugh and cry with.  I was a cashier put out stock and blew up balloons. greet people as came threw the door. it was a good place to work but don't get very many hours.
good,Working at Dollar Tree is good. Flexible work schedule. Working part time you do not receive and commissions or benefits. Everything is a Dollar. The manger is very good and will train you.
good,"- A typical day at Dollar Tree for me was that i would always be busy stocking candies and on the cash register. "
good,Need to be very productive and must be able to multi task. Bonus potential is good but work and life balance is tough. Payroll is a challenge because of stores price point
good,"i liked it and my position,,just some people were difficult..i would recomend to work here it just depends on wich store you want to apply for.other than its cool"
good,The people environment everything about the dollar tree was a good experience for me and what I I learn that anything is possible when I got my manager position it's was amazing
good,It is a decent work environment but the pay is bad. You can be limited on hours do to the way they do pay role. it is a good 2nd job but you can not support anybody as an only job.
good,"dollar tree is a great company to work for, it is very flexible with my school schedule, I love the work environment the customers and the staff are very welcoming and fun to be around on a daily basis, i dont have any complaints about my job expect for the position is only part time"
good,I liked the fact that they are organized. They make sure their employees are comfortable and treated with respect. The atmosphere is peaceful. Never had issues like that.
good,"very busy productive day. nice management team positive vibes different personalities some good some bad, would of  liked to have stocked more then cashier."
good,"I would follow my routine like... Clean the store, make sure everything went smoothly, assist customers, and made sure my employees were safe. The hardest thing about my job is trying to get everything done that needs to be done. I learned that being a leader was important and had a lot of responsibilities but I enjoyed learning about Management. The most enjoyable thing was no matter what you can always have fun working."
good,The job would be less stressful if you had ample employee to put the freight out on a timely basis the amount of freight sent to the store does not match the amount of only having two stocker putting out 1600 cartoons in 48 hrs and only working 5 hrs shifts that leaves the bulk of stocking to the freight manager to do and also the freight manager have to ring the register with only one cashier so having to multi task is a given every day my store we have a great staff though small we do the best we can to keep our store clean for our customer and our stock room organize and keep turning over the merchandise Hardest part of my job is having to do freight and ring to register when it gets busy it puts a great strain on me most enjoyable part of the job is having customer find what there are looking for and also new items not on there list
good,It is a great first time job for someone who just wants to work part time. Hours are not abundant. Nice people. Easy to learn the register and its a smaller store so it is much easier to manage multiple areas at once
good,If you don't mind the retail world then Dollar Tree is an ideal place to work. Overall decent pace work flow and cash registers super easy to use. This location is a overall very busy store so you can expect to stay pretty busy. If you are not on register you will be on sales floor cleaning up pretty much non stop. It's a small enough store you really get the chance to know your coworkers and management and have a great opportunity to build a work family.
good,This was your typical cashiering job. Managers we always nice and worked alongside employees. It was a very fair job. I enjoyed the cusomers and very rarely had any problems.
good,"its a great job , i disliked the long hours , but enjoyed 3 day weeknd the work was fast paced, and competitive which i loved. draining on body tho. the pay was excellent"
good,"I enjoyed working at Dollar Tree because everyday I would learn different things. One hour i will do customer service/cashier, the next i will stock up , and do maintenance work as well. I love doing different things because I will have much more experience."
good,Working with others is what makes the job so much fun. You learn something new everyday. You meet new people every day. You build a good relationship with the company.
good,I loved to cleaned and fix isles but it was difficult when a customer needed checkout assistance constantly. We were always instructed to do tasks like unloading boxes and putting them on shelves but the work environment was too short of staff to ever have time to properly get things done.
good,"I liked working at the dollar store, became friends with my co workers and even my boss! My manager was very nice, she worked around my school schedule and even when I just needed a day off she was very fair!"
good,"My duties were pretty cut and dry. I rang up customers, unloaded truck deliveries, stocked shelves, decorated the store as seasons passed and handled money, cleaning equipment and chemicals. The decorating was the best part. We had certain requirements to meet but we also had quite a bit of artistic freedom."
good,It's fit for younger people great pay and benefits hard work putting boxes on the convery belt with the labels matching the location you are to do 400 an hour
good,"Fun place to work where the motto is, ""Why pay more when you only need to spend a $1?""  Customers are happy with the good prices and share easy joy back with you.  Fun!"
good,Pay was minimal and the amount of hours is not good. managers are  probably the best part of that job. other than that it was just an average part time job.
good,helpful people I worked with like to help me and show me how to do things and how the store did things and what was expected out of the employees and over all friendly people
good,I worked for Dollar Tree as a cashier/recovery person and worked my way up the ladder.  I became a store manager with in a two year period and built a strong team.
good,"Dollar tree is a good company to work with but you won't get much hours if you're part time unless you are cool with the manager, no security for the company to make as much money as they make"
good,this was a great opportunity for me to gain knowledge into the retail customer service. i learned how to order merchandise and truck orders. Learned how to set up a store and open.
good,"It was good working there.Nice environment,friendly cooperation,helpful co-workers.Management was good.No hard part..co workers were caring and helpful too.Store manager was the best one..he can assist everyone properly.time management was really good."
good,"Good college job, worked around my school schedule, only worked part time on the week days and fulltime on weekends, wasn't really social with co workers, but had no problems."
good,The management was helpful and kind.  If you are in need of assistance coworkers were good to guide you as well as management without making you feel inadequate. The hardest part were the days where you had to go in at 3 instead of the regular 5 to 10. Hours can change depending on the holiday you are working.
good,"The working environment was good ,Stayed busy most of the day which is what I like. But I didn't get many hours definitely not worth working there for 8.25."
good,Store is visited for aggressive customer including shoplifters. Managers do not have enough knowledge on how to manage people. I learnt how to manage people.
good,"Dollar Tree is a pleasure to work for.  Typically it is not a stressful environment, and upkeep and maintenance of the sales floor and warehouse are typically straightforward and simple.  Any given location can function with only two employees present at most given times.  The pay is not great but it accurately reflects what the company asks of its employees."
good,"I'm a sales associate so most of my evening is spent as a cashier, we have the best customers and I enjoy helping them to have a good experience each time they shop in our store.  I also help to stock shelves, set up displays, and just about anything else the management needs."
good,"I would open up in the mornings with stocking ,cleaning and helping other employees and customers with items or working I always was a helping hand so this job was not much."
good,"I learned a lot working at Dollar Tree, and advanced rather quickly. I really enjoyed working with the people there and gained a lot of retail knowledge."
good,"dollar tree will give you anything and everything to do. Be prepared to be changed in different positions at anytime. Of course everybody knows how costumers can be, but patients is a virtue. Every place is different just depends on where you work at. Even after I had stopped working there they had called me many times if they needed help and that helped me out a lot."
good,a calm place to work. everyone is easy to get along with. one of my favorite places to work. very easy but yet fast at times on the weeekends.
good,"Fast paced, great working with diverse group of people."
good,I write it was interesting because everyday was different due to having different customers come in with all kinds of different personalities. The work was the same everyday though.
good,Personally I do not think they pay enough. The location I worked at had a lot of immature people who cared more to talk about each other rather than work together. Absolutely loved the customers as well.
good,"I had good days and bad days but , for myself I managed to get through them things I've learned was that let the customers be right because you don't want to lose there service or not have any period because of how you treat people."
good,"-a typical day was working at the register and helping the customers find anything they needed, and re-shopping all the items that didn't get purchased"
good,I enjoyed working here. My only complaint is that I was only making 7.25 in 2010 and the manager then had an attitude and disposition that wasn't very inviting for the employees.
good,if i can do it all over again i would but also with kids and bill working there part time wasnt helping out. my manger i had was easy to talk to n he didnt make it hard on any one i also love my store members they was all great people.
good,"A typical day for me would be closing since I had just enrolled in college and depending on the day of the week, I would work 8-10 hours a day.  I had some good checks from even with earning minimum wage because I went to school Monday -Friday and worked 5 days or more a week.  My of days were during the week because I was better at closing, according to my manager so he wanted me on the longer nights which was the weekend.  I did not have a lot of free time because I went to CSU and took the rapid so I did not get home until close to 4 so I would come home from school and head straight to work.  It was hard managing about 40 hours a week of work and being a full time student so I eventually left the company to catch up with my school work."
good,I work for  dollar tree  for a year as a shift manager I loved my position there they have great benefits the costumer say dollar tree is a great company
good,I like working at the dollar tree. It is a good company. I loved it alot. But i was just temporary. If i could go back I would. The good management there.
good,"Always things to do, there's never a time where you're left standing around doing nothing! "
good,"This is a typical Retail environment,  run by a large Corporate company from the USA.   Nothing bad to say about them, the staff is what makes it worth working there."
good,"A typical day at dollar tree consist of being up at the cash register , meeting all those wonderful people and getting to help them out. I've learned how to connect with the customers and help thhem find whatever they need to find. I've also learned how to stock and put things out on the shelves . The hardest part of my job is when a customer gets frustrated at something and i'm not able to figure what they need out . I enjoy talking to the customers , i'm a peoples person , I love meeting new people and I know how to talk to them and handle any problems they have."
good,Dollar tree was fun. Great customers.  Fun managers. Flexible work hours. Don't really have anything bad to say about them. Love the stores.
good,counting cash drawers making deposits stocking shelves customer services Did enjoy everyone I worked with did learn how to be a part of a team and learned how to be a leader and to have self confidence in myself
good,Its an okay job if school is your priority. You get like 4 hours a day 2 to 4 times a week if you are lucky. I like 2 managers in the store the other ones changed so much and are always talking smack (even about the other managers). I love seeing the usual customers coming in (: you get to meet them and see them as more as just a customer.
good,"enjoyable about working here was creativity.Hardest thing was trying to make enough space to set up all our products nice & neat .Everyone gets along teamwork was dependable.Management treated employees with respect and dignity.Trying to make everyone feel as they did a good job.I learned how to be more organized,pay attention to detail,and listen to customers needs. A typical day is stocking and more stocking. Making sure it was safe & clean.Most important was Customer Service."
good,"Work at this location was the same for everyone. To work as a cashier to asked to clean the store. Both tasks are simple and are done by all workers. Cleaning the store is not difficult, only tedious as merchandise is frequently misplaced. "
good,I rember the first day I started working for dollar tree I was so scared then as time passed it started to fill like family then more time passed and I became manager then it got scary all over again but I finally got the hang of it didn't take me long but we all still felt like family that's the best part about working there filling like family.
good,"Typical day involved counting a drawer to $100, stocking/rotating items as needed,  putting out weekly special buy items in the window, waiting on customers, cleaning back room storage area, and assisting customers to their car with large orders. "
good,A typical day just includes providing excellent customer service and making sure the store stays clean and stocked and the dressing rooms stay cleaned.
good,I enjoy the people and all the great deals! There is always a great find here at the Dollar Tree! I have a great Manager! This is a good company to work for.
good,"worked as a team, flexable hours. locations are great. did have to go to the bank every night to make a deposit so you need a car to get there.  well run company."
good,"The thing I most enjoyed about working at dollar tree was the fun work environment, the managers were nice and understanding. I had flexible hours since I was still in school at the time."
good,customers are friendly and love shopping there. There are new products coming in every week and it keeps the customers happy.
good,"The Dollar Tree is a great stepping stone towards learning about customer service, strong organizational skills, problem solving and working in a fast-paced, team environment."
good,"I enjoyed going to work everyday and seeing the nice customers."
good,"It is challenging because this job really challenges how patient you are yet how well you can handle stress at the same time. For example, every day multiple times a day someone is going to ask you ""How much is this?"" ""what time you close"". Basically, you will get ask the same thing every time At times it feels like you constantly living the same thing over and over. Depending on the location you will get manager's who is nowhere near ready, but yet they are managers. At the same time, you have great managers. Co-workers there are going to be either great because they help, lazy people, people who feel they can do whatever they want. It's the same like any other place. At the end f the day you will have fun if you're the type of person who tends to lighten up everyone day in a stressful environment."
good,I ran the cash register and kept store in clean order. I assisted customers when they came in the store. Nice environment to work in at a young age.
good,"i loved my job for the most part, very good place to work. the customers will drive you crazy asking how much something is when there are signs everywhere that tell you EVERYTHINGS one dollar. would work here again now, if it wasnt so far."
good,"checked out customers and put items back in the correct bind"
good,Dollar Tree is a great place to work. The management is great and works well with you and your life outside of work. The employees are wonderful and fun to get to know as well as helpful when needed.
good,"A typical day at work is to replenish the merchandise on the shelves after customers have sorted through and/or purchased items.  Also cleaning floors, dusting shelves and straightening up displays.  I enjoyed being part of a productive team.  Management changed frequently which made having a set schedule difficult to rely on. The best part of the job was the sense of accomplishment at the end of the shift when everything was neat  and orderly again and ready for a new day of customers."
good,"For me a typical day at work is very busy, a lot of standing for sure."
good,"The time I've spent at Dollar Tree has been rewarding. It gave me the experience needed to work in such an environment and would hopefully become a manager if not there then somewhere else where I can help train others in such a place. The management was decent, but wish they hired people that have already worked there to become managers that way there is no wasted time on training someone new. Instead you would have someone who knows what is needed and can bring the best out of people because of the familiarity."
good,We always had a good time at work. Everyone was always in a good mood and we worked as a team. There was this time at work where a customer was not happy so she was yelling at all of my co-workers. So I went over to her and started a conversation and asked if I can help her find anything and if we do not have it here I can point her to where she can find the item. The customer was very satisfied and when she came into our store she would only want my help. I always loved to make sure the customers was happy when they left the store and the store was well organized. The best part was working as a team.
good,"Very friendly and productive, there was always things to be done like stocking, cleaning or taking care of customers. I think the hardest part of the job was keeping the shelves completely stock most of the day. The most enjoyable part of the day was helping the customers."
good,"on till"
good,"I liked working there as I was a manager, I made a lot of friends and met some awesome co workers. I love how nothing was over a buck and a quarter. Nice place to work and very nice people."
good,"I would stock the shelves if need. I cleaned the cashier area. Help the customers, cash the customers out, Had fun."
good,"The store I worked for is dedicated to the customer experience. Our number one goal is to provide a clean, friendly, and stocked environment for the customers to enjoy. If its not on the shelf then the customer is unable to purchase it for their needs. If the store is a mess the customer cannot find it. The customer comes first no matter what the job you are currently doing is. Making a friendly recommendation or running to find something the customer asked for is a constant show of our willingness to assist our customers in any way."
good,"A day at dollar tree is generally very fast past with heavy loads. I have learned how to manage navigating the needs of the clients while still achieving the goals I set for myself for that day."
good,"I learned how to run a store."
good,Fun work environment with great staff. Leading my team through great customer service with diverse clients. The most enjoyable part of my job was working alongside my colleagues and learning from them.
good,Dollar Tree in Chicago is a fun place to work. Always something to do or someone to help. I like cashiering and helping all the customer who come to know you as a regular there. A trust develops and it feels good to know they appreciate your helping them to decide which product is best for there needs.
good,A good starter management job. Training is good. Advancement is a real possibility. Be prepared to transfer stores or help at other locations.
good,Work place was fun and easy going. On slow days I mostly stocked and recovered certain areas. Coworkers and customers were friendly and easy to get along with. During holidays we were busy but stayed efficient and happy.
good,Fast paced environment with numerous task that can be productive with a good combination of teamwork and detailed time management. Consistently work to improve communications with supervisors and subordinates to help identify teams strengths and weaknesses to effectively address our customers experience.
good,"Dollar Tree was one of the few jobs I was able to get. I know the Manager very well and she decided to take the chance and hire me. I did good but the workers and even the Manager herself are being very over worked. So now I am looking for a job that doesn't over work to the point where it feels like boot camp. The Manager is great, the employee's well not so great."
good,Very productive place. Tons of shipment 1800+ pieces a week. Frieght is a must to get out. The interaction with every customer is the best part.
good,Worked 4-5 hour shifts per day. Couldn't work more than 40 hours a week because then I would become a full-time employee. I was only looking for a part-time job so this job worked out for us.
good,A typical day consists of constant interaction with customers. I am either on the register getting customers through checkout as quickly as possible or aiding my colleagues in recovering the store. When I'm not cashiering or recovering aisles I am returning unwanted items back to where they belong. When I'm out on the floor I spend a lot of time directing customers to merchandise they are searching for. On occasions I pack out new merchandise for customers to purchase.
good,"Dollar Tree was a good experience, but they did not work with my school schedule. The one thing that I loved about the job was meeting new people. To see a person come in and you can help them with their purchase is an awesome feeling."
good,I liked working at Dollar Tree.  It was a great job. I would recommend working there to anyone looking for a part-time job.
good,"I'd spend most of my 5 hour shift behind the register and maintaining the front of the store, greeting customers as they arrived and enjoyed the morning shift. I learned how to properly operate a cash register and handle cash and credit transactions. For the most part I was on my own during my shift, we'd have a Store Manager running daily operations and a stocker out in the aisles.I enjoyed the fast pace of work, shifts seemed to go by very quick and I enjoyed my time working here very much."
good,"Busy and fast paced working environment. Always requires organization, problem solving and clean-ups in and around the store. Management is super supportive and very easy to get along with. I am happy to meet new people everyday and receive many compliments from staff, management and customers which makes my job always a positive experience."
good,I have been working at dollar tree partime . the experience was fine . love the environment. I only leave there because I didn't see my self moving up for the better in the ccompany and I also moved out the state
good,"When I was a manager there, the managers over me tried to get me fired because I was running the store the correct way. So glad that those managers are now fired."
good,"I enjoyed my job, however, I got laid off. There was a lot of the store manager wanting us to work off the clock so she didnt go over her payroll. Other than that was a great place to work."
good,Working with a very nice co-workers and management that is flexible with the hours. Typically you help the customers locating the stuff and cashing out the register with a smile.
good,"Dollar Tree was okay, I only worked there for like a month . The management was a little unsatisfying but it was a job and paid me good money and good hours."
good,"I opened and closed the store, which included counting cash drawers and making bank deposits. Delivered excellent customer service by greeting and assisting each customer. Directed and supervised employees engaged in sales, inventory-taking and reconciling cash receipts. Maintained daily record of all transactions."
good,Working at dollar tree was always a great experience due to the fact of meeting new people and putting smiles on customers faces.
good,the most enjoyable part of this job is all the customers I deal with on a daily basis. we are a busy store so the day flies by and the customers can really put a smile on my face
good,"It was a rocky start. The scheduling was handled poorly and management wasn't great. When new management came in, things seemed to turn around. Although there was quite a bit of drama, two face situations that I felt to be uncomfortable. I always felt that I was being talked about so I kept my personal matters private. I approved of the system we used and had no issues with the work and customer service involved."
good,"General business correspondence for CLO (Chief Logistics Officer) and other management in Logistics Department."
good,I enjoyed working with the public and having fun at the same time. Greeting customers was one of the highlights of the job.
good,The company itself and rules and regulations are one that anybody can adapt to and it offered a fun and always changing environment.
good,a typical day at work would be doing the daily things you'd normally do example stock shelves. i learned to always come in with a positive attitude and if anyone got rude to just ignore it. my co-workers were nice for the most part but in the work life you just gotta look at it as there doing there job or they may be in a bad mood etc but its not going to reflect me. hardest part of the job was doing another co-workers job on top of doing mine if they didnt finish up. the most enjoyable part is payday of course
good,It is a busy day. Especially when opening up the store. I have learned how to operate my register and count my till on a daily basis. Management is works pretty well with associates and makes sure that they are doing their job.
good,"Dollar Tree is a very fun place to work in, the pay is not up to the level that it should be, the amount of work does not meet the pay, I believe that a person's time should be worth more than $7.50hr."
good,"I assisted customers in whatever they needed, rang them up at the register, received payments, issued receipts, refunds and change. Counted my drawer before and after my shift ensuring amounts were correct. My co workers and managers were very friendly and tried to make the job environment as pleasent as possible."
good,"The hours you get here would be good foe someone still in school, attending college, or of you only have a few days a week you can work."
good,"I learned how to greet people with full respect and became more friendly. My most enjoyable part of working there is being around people that are very nice and have respect for you and everyone in the store. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the miserable people that come in the store, but it doesn't bother me because they can have a problem at home so I don't pay it no mind. The management was great, they taught me how to do so much in a short period of time. They are very respectful."
good,Acquired more computer skills to increase job potential. Before divisional realignment job was enjoyable. After changes job was less fulfilling.
good,"upon arriving at work, you  turn on the lights and a whole new day of possibilities begins. Truck day leads to a physical workout followed by a mental/physical workout merchandising the stock.Team work is required to be productive and meet all our goals. Seeing what you have accomplished by the end of the day whether it be a new layout or just filling empty shelves you know that your work has contributed to the profits of the store and company."
good,"The day was very energetic ,coworkers tried there best to keep the work environment peaceful and homey."
good,"Mondays and tuesdays we unload the truck and process frieght, and maintain our aisels. How to be a more productive at work with little time. managment is understanding and very helpful. The work enviorment is a fun place to work due to the fact the employees are nice. the hardest part of the job is to please every customer with little help. the enjoable part of the job is meeting the customers. there friendly and show gratitude for our service."
good,"I recently started but it is a fair work environment."
good,"meeting with costumers, get insight on things you need to work on, read company rules, an fowling up on it, ever one that works with the company is great, the only thing bad is theirs not enough hours, an there are great benefits that the company has for all employees."
good,At times it was a fun place to work with a team that would help each other with any questions or problems
good,"Ring up customers"
good,Company was good to work for. No great perks but a steady job. I enjoyed the people I worked...some of which I am still friends with. It was very easy as far as merchandise went since everything was only a dollar
good,"Cashier: Operated register, Customer service, stocking, cleaning"
good,a typical day at work consisted of helping customers and keeping the store clean and organized. I learned that great customer service goes a long way. management and co workers were fun and joked around sometimes.
good,"I worked an average of 11 hours per day.  My job was to write a schedule weekly for 3 assistant managers and 10 employees.  I also planned the daily worksheet to accomplish what was expected of me.  I have managed 5 stores plus in my 7 years at Dollar Tree."
good,"There was never a dull day working here, some days were better than others. I had a great time working here and seeing my regular customers and getting along great with all of my co-workers. Management wasn't always doing the best job but they tried. The hardest part of the job was keeping cool to rude customers, but I got through it with no problem. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers find whatever they needed and making them smile."
good,"Memorization of current and brand new items, selling big key items and promoting new interesting things."
good,The work was easy the pay was lousy for a seasonal worker.  Yet managers and supervisors were great.  I did not like the fact you can be called in at any moment.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was my customers and coworkers.

good,great I love it just needs more employment. it was nice helping customers since I knew the price of everything and where everything was.
good,"Short shifts, enjoyable people, management is great, understanding employee's to speak to."
good,"I worked at the dollar tree for almost 2 years and in those 2 years I got a lot of experience with customer service, cash handling, depositing money to the bank, and worked with good people that was willing to help by any means necessary. I did cashiering and was a floor associate and I was good at that so good that management would ask me question of how to put a display up and my option mattered and it felt great."
good,Co-workers were great. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers who were so bright and lively.
good,was cashier did drawer count costumer service enjoyed working with my co workers i loved the management team the hardest part was closing out my drawer and counting all the money i enjoyed  doing the aisle set ups and stocking made work move  on a fast pace
good,Very Challenging and is great learning new things. There is never a dull moment.
good,"Easy to catch on"
good,The mangers and co-workers are friendly. Comfortable environment and flexible hours. Its really busy on the weekends and you have to be able to multi-task really fast.
good,As a cashier you are required to maintain the correct amount of money in the till throughout your shift. Training was easy and very understandable. Co-workers are nice and helpful. You learn quickly in a sometimes fast-paced environment.
good,I learned to depend on myself if I wanted something done. A typical day at work included stocking and pricing items for sale and checking out custmers on the register.
good,"It's a pretty calm environment, although we can get pretty busy. I have acquired better math skills, as well as people skills and communication skills. My co-workers are all terrific workers."
good,"As store manager days wheere bus. The customers are fun to serve as there are in the store to find their treasurs, at only a dollar. Providing high levels of service was the mission of the day. This would include product on floor, greeting and being interactive with them."
good,"cashier duties, help customers, clean, do go back, management and coworkers are great and very flexible"
good,"A typical day at Dollar Tree is fun, unexpected situations, hard work, and helping customers. What I have learned is that a positive attitude will take you a long way and it also puts others in a welcoming environment and makes them wanna come back. The management team was a little disorganized but they were getting better. the hardest part of the job was trying to keep the environment safe for the employees as well as the customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was satisfied customers and knowing that your the one who put that smile on their faces."
good,"At Dollar Tree a typical day at work would include ringing up customers and getting through the line in a timely manner. If there wasn't a line to be rung up then I was stocking shelve with items if needed. Lastly, if there were no items that needed to be stocked then I was cleaning up the aisles. Working at Dollar Tree I learned how to speak to customers on a regular basis and how to deal with irate people without letting it get out of hand. My mangers and co-workers were great people. I had built friendships with each and every one of the people I worked with. There were many parts to this job; but I would say that the hardest part would have been when I had long lines and I was standing in one spot for hours on end it would begin to hurt my back, but it was nothing that I couldn't handle. The most enjoyable part of that job though was meeting new people and creating somewhat of a friendship with ""regular"" customers and them recognizing me and getting to know them on a more personal level then just as a customer."
good,go in at 5 am unlock the door start a register so my stockers could clock in and  go in the office look at daily plan fill out stocker sheets  accordingly  go to stockroom stack and count uboat's  take them to sales floor start stocking check on stockers  occasionally to make sure their work is up to Dollar Tree standards. i learned on a daily basis how to push out more and more product as well as how to do resets by season. i would have to say the hardest part of the job was the Christmas reset trying to push it all out to ensure less  packaways. the best part of the job was the sense of accomplishment I felt at the end of each day knowing that I did the job to the best of my ability. Another great thing about the job i liked was getting to interact with the customers helping them find the products that the needed and suggesting other products that might help them as well.
good,the over all jobs is nice however you are given very few hours a week I believe the management plays favorites with a couple employees
good,My day consisted of helping and waiting on customers whom were the most enjoyable part of my job. II ama people person who loves interaction with the public. Management and co-workers work together to create a productive workplace.
good,A typical day at work was very busy. It was always busy and there was never any room for down time which I highly enjoyed. I learned to motivate people into buying our dry sale items. The co-workers were all friendly and I got along with all of them. The hardest part of the job was trying to sell items that were being taken to military families. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was interacting with all the customers.
good,"keeping inventory, stacking and unpacking boxes was a typical day at work. will working at dollar tree i learned patience and to keep calm under a heavy work load."
good,"I've worked with the company for almost 2 years with different managers who left, transfer, or newly hired. I love going to work to interact with my fellow coworkers because they are all friendly and very helpful, same goes for the managers as well. The job is fair, there isn't anything that is hard. Everything is basic common sense."
good,"A typical day would consist of verbal communication with co-workers, along with customers. I complete stocking of all items in store location. Ive learned that having patients and communication the work load gets easy. Management is excellent, they make sure you are comfortable. Co-workers are very friendly. There is no hard part of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job for me is meeting new people."

good,"Dollar tree is a very productive, steady, and high pace job."
good,Managers are pleasant to work with. Stocking shelves was fun. Everyone works as a team.
good,"At work we open up make sure the store looks ok to present. I greet customers as they walk in and get ready to cash them out, with a smile. I've learned from this experience is that the customers are not always right. You can always help customers when they calm down. I love when customers come in with a smile and make your day and talk to you like you are important too. Everyone on the job was great."
good,Working cash registers was what I did majority when I wasn't working on registers I was a stocker. I worked on truck such as unloading and stocking things in back.
good,"It was a good job, I was just pregnant with a lot of doctor's appointments...  I worked some mornings an some overnights...."
good,I supervised an early morning stocking crew then open the store set up the cashiers walk the store and implement a daily plan for all the associates for that day to get merchandise to the floor enter in vendors throughout the day and once a week receive a truck which had to be put out on floor in 48 hours
good,Dollar tree will always be one of my favorite jobs.  Even though I ended up spending most of my paycheck at the store itself (which as you can image is hard to do since everything is only $1) I always went home happy.  The staff was always fun to be around and getting to interact with and help the customers was always a great joy of mine.
good,Good place for a person that wants to grow with a company. DollarTree is always looking for good people.
good,"I honestly love working for the Dollar Tree.  It has its flaws like any other place but great people, great management, and great deals.  A typical day I serve the customers and more than not the customer leaves happy. I learned a lot there like merchandising, how to hit marginal and sales goals, how to create a schedule so that each person worked has to make a dollar amount per hour to make sales for the week.  How to manage the truck in order to get freight out in 48 hours.  The hardest part of the job for me is manage the time your are given.  The most enjoyable part is going out of my way to make each customer that needs help happy!"
good,"A typical day at work would be working the register, taking out the trash, sometimes filling balloon corrals, front face, doing go-backs(putting merchandise back where they belong inside the store), taking 10 minute breaks, and friendly coworkers. the hardest part of the job was keeping merchandise in place and keeping the store as clean as it was opened during the day as customers come in and out of the store. The enjoyable part of the job was the hard work and hours i put in for my pay check and also meeting new people getting along with others."
good,The typical day on this job is giving good customer service at all times. I started off being an early morning stocker and then moved to being a cashier. The co-workers were awesome. The hours got scarce and I had to start looking for a job that would offer me hours so I could be able to provide for my family.
good,greet customers & help them locate any items they cant find and well as provide the best customer service
good,I loved the customers. The management was good. I loved my co-workers .
good,"id go into work and work as a cashier, I learned how to work a cashier more efficiently. My management was ok my managers were very nonchalant. The hardest part is of the job was when their are to many customers and I'm the only one on register. The most enjoyable is when I'm not the only worker on the registers."
good,Dollar Tree is a wonderful place to work and the people I work with is great.
good,Typical office work environment.  Learned great customer service skills with this company.
good,Ensure customers are assisted when needed and assist them with their purchases at anytime requested.
good,"the company is a good company, but I need better job. I enjoy work on a warehouse. stock organice everthing. I work very well in team"
good,My day at work is normally started by arriving around 20 minutes early. I get my stuff together and get my work space in order. I greet my customers and start ringing up sales for the day. I keep a positive attitude and work on upsaleing the customers. I clean up the store area and keep busy doing anything that might need to be done around the store between.  I have learned the ins and outs of retail during my time here. I work well with my co-workers and we have a great teamwork attitude within our store. The hardest part of ths job is that my hours vary so much. I go from opening to closing to mid shift work regularly and that makes it hard to make plans or schedule appointments. The most enjoyable part of the job is the customers. I really like interacting with different people. 
good,a typical day a work would be working at the register and when you had time you would be stocking the shelves. 
good,"Work the registers, clean and organize store, help customers with their questions and problems."
good,"A typical day at Dollar Tree would be cashiering. Some customers would come in upset, but by the time they left they would be in a better mood because of how friendly and caring people who worked there are.  Even myself, if I was not in a great mood, by the end of my shift I would be very happy. I have learned how to pay close attention to money and how to treat it like it is my own money. My co workers were great people to work with.  Everyone was so friendly and kind to one another. The most hardest part of the day would be taking care of rude and impatient customers who are always in a rush to get out of the store. Then, the best part of the job was to get compliments everyday how nice the cashiers and managers are and how it seems just a nice place to work.  I would say that Dollar Tree was a great first job based on the people I worked with and the customers who came into the store that made me smile."
good,"My typical day was entering into who needs breaks and lunches , do a store walk to see where needs to be straighten out or filled to add more of the products, face and front through out the store vaccume all rug area's damage out items that need to be taken account for the inventory make sure floors are clean and cleared of any protental fall or slip hazareds , make sure the store is up and running correctly for the next day of operations .Learned how to except shipments and take account of all in coming shock .

good,"I worked as an associate at Dollar Tree, running a register, and stocking shelves. Management was excellent. They were excellent motivators, without having unrealistic expectations. The turnover rate among my co-workers, was quite high. The most difficult part of the job was the irregular hours. The opportunity to serve many satisfied customers was the crowning part of this job."
good,They dont want you to have more than 15 hrs for 2weeks and only working 7.25. I cant understand why the wont hire high school kids
good,Would go in and count money with a manager and get tills ready for the day. Open store and stocked front end while checking customers out. I learned how to multitask in a fast pace environment. Management was always helpful when we need help on registers or to be able to answer questions. Hardest thing was to keep shelves stocked around the holiday. I really enjoyed giving customer service.
good,"A typical day at Dollar Tree would require warmly greeting customers before, during, and after shift. I also handled running the cash register, as well as stocking throughout the day. I learned how to deal with different customers and their personalities. Management was wonderful. The managers stayed on top of their job, enforcing the rules. My co-workers were friendly and helpful. They would be a helping hand to me when needed, as I would to them. I don't believe I had any hard times during my job, I enjoy working so nothing really bothered me; as far as working late,etc. The most enjoyable part of my job would be actually running the cash register, meeting and greeting the customers, and knowing that they were well satisfied that the customer service was wonderful once they entered and exited the store."
good,"A typical morning shift coming in at 6:00 am preparing the stock room for available space so we can unload the trucks up to 1700 pieces of merchandise on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. Our Freight Manager sets the workers up to each department and pack out what we can until our shift is over. The communication between my co-workers were good, didn't have any problems with any of my co-workers and we worked together on getting our departments done on time. I've never really had a hard part at work. Everything was an easy task job."
good,Always busy and great atmosphere to work with the retail public and save them money.
good,"Always Maintaining the store and customer service were number one. I learned how to restock and break down shipment, i also learned how to take inventory on merchandise. Always had a new manager and coworkers. The hardest part was dealing with all the thefts and shoplifters, the most enjoyable part was always working in a fun environment."
good,Numerous employees would call in and I would be the back up person that would be called in since I lived so close.
good,"community oriented, you tend to see the same people and it will make your day. Pay is horrible but good place to be."
good,"Co-workers are really nice, management is firm and easy going. I really enjoy working here, there is a friendly inviorment. Ther wasnothing really hard abot the job, I suppose the truck was a pain sometimes, thats about it."
good,I wasn't at this job long enough to learn much about the company but did enjoy my time there. Management seemed to be disorganized when it came to employee placement and had issues notifying employees of important issues such as following night manager to bank when closing. Though this is a small store they were well stocked even for the Christmas season and all employees including management were very helpful and friendly to customers.
good,Working at the Dollar Tree has been a great experience. I really enjoy helping the costumers and seeing them get great deals. I've learned allot from the management and have been looking forward to maybe getting a management position when we get our new store.

good,Teamwork encouraged. I learned how to manage competing/conflicting priorities. Typical day went by fast.
good,I was manly on cashier most of the time. When we close there is other people with you and everyone leaft togather so nothing happen to us.
good,this job is great. it allows you to meet and network with serveral people. my co-workers are nice. the most enjoyable part of the job is the co-workers and the customers.
good,"Stocked shelves,unloaded a truck. Hardest part was truck day. Enjoyable part was stocking the shelves and knowing that you helped set up the store for opening."
good,Duties ranged from unloading a truck and stocking shelves to customer service. Worst part of the job was cleaning up the store before close at night.
good,Dollar Tree is a convenient type groceries and retail accessories store that does help the employees and customers in need. I learned that you have to be quick and multi-task with everything and you have to stay alert at all times. Management is decent. My co-workers are real nice and down to earth. The hardest part of your the job is keeping customers happy and muti-taking to do cashiering and cleaning up the store. The most enjoyable part is that the store values simplicity to where everyone is fair to one another.
good,"Like the early morning shift, I clock in and we start unloading the truck. We then stock the merchandise on the sales floor. Management is easy to communicate with and we get along great."
good,Dollar Tree was a fast paced environment. Being that I was a key holder I kept busy assisting customers and supervising other employees. The most difficult but bearable part of this job was preparing for big holidays and meeting customers demands for supplies such as Thanksgiving and Christmas.
good,"Since working for Dollar Tree, I haven't got the chance to work much due to rapid changes in management. Plus the change in hours vary alot. I have a family and it's hard just to have this steady income and a temp job to work with."
good,"this was a fun job. great co workers, never really felt stressed at this job"
good,"I do recovery. I recover the store, collect carts, face shelves, clean the bathrooms, cashier from time to time, and do whatever else may be asked of me."
good,had to move to orlando and found a better job with universal studios
good,"The ""Dollar Tree"" has a wide variety of items that just may be on your shopping list for a fraction of the cost. Most (if not all) items at the store go for a USD or less."

good,"I love the concept... everything is $1.00"
good,"My workplace is very productive, family friendly, and a positive attitude environment. Everyone is very supportive of each other and makes sure our customers are helped with a smile."
good,I work at night so i like the fact i don't have to deal with customers. I can work at a comfortable pase never pressured at work. It could be better with more help but knowing the location of store. That wouldn't help. Sometimes it gets frustrating cause customers don't care. But besides that the job is fine.
good,Wish I was able to work full-time cause I loved my customers and the job I did and coworkers.my coworkers and manger was very understanding with my health issues and worked with me.I enjoyed seeing smiling faces and making costumers happy and pleased with their experience at our dollar tree store.

good,Overall Dollar tree was a very rewarding experience. It's a good for for someone just starting out in the work industry and looking to get their feet wet. I highly recommend.
good,"Overall it was a good work inviroment,it just needs better pay and better benefits and employee appreciation.The company does have a good price point as well"
good,Department managers are in charge of their team and are responsible for their training and productivity.  The management team does and excellent job at pushing information out to managers.

good,Some things could be improved overall working there was good. Some what fast paced work it was easy to learn the way the company ran. I learned new things to take with me to other jobs
good,"great place to work, great customer service and I loved the people I work with and they are fast paced... management is fair and very helpful... great hours"
good,I enjoyed my time working with family dollar and dollar tree I started out as a cashier and moved up to an assistant manager. And I wouldn’t trade that experience for nothing in the world
good,Great company you can learn a lot about it if it’s a teen first job over the years the company has benefited me and helping me with my family also helps me
good,I enjoyed most of the work here although unloading heavy boxes from trucks is not for everybody.  I liked my co workers and and had a great Mgr when I worked there
good,"I was responsible for stocking an average of 900 cases a week. Was also the ASM, backup cashiering and almost never had time to take any breaks or lunches."

good,The crew there is very nice and helpful. Everyone got along well enough. The manager is very compassionate. The location is great. The area is easy to get in and out of. Love this dollar store.
good,When I was hired for a Cashier position I was Ecstatic to be able to help Dollar Tree. My few days on the job were very fun and also productive. Unfortunately  i had to quit my job with Dollar Tree to move back to El Paso.
good,Dollar Tree is an productive and friendly work place. we stay busy with loving customers and they all make you feel like family.when you come in you look to keep the store clean and safe for the customer on some days you will have to work between customers to put out merchandise in a cleanly why to keep you and the customers safe
good,Dollar Tree is a good company to work for they will work around family life. The management is easy to talk to about anything you have or are having an issue with.
good,"I think the work culture is fantastic at Dollar Tree. The manager is awesome, and the assistant managers are also great to work with. They leave you alone for the most part. I only work there part-time. I would not like to work there full time. Too busy of a place."
good,"Working in the the location that I got hired in. The store manager and her assistant managers definitely makes the work environment a fun place to come to work everyday. And doesn't make you feel like your not welcome, it's the complete opposite of that."
good,This was my first job and it was pretty good. They pay is unfortunately awful because of the low prices in the store. You have to juggle a lot working there but it’s nothing hard. All in all a very easy and enjoyable job. I quit when I had to relocate. I would’ve gladly transferred if the pay was better. I was also fortunate to have great and considerate management and decent coworkers.
good,Great hours. Great management . Great customers.. all the employees were friendly.. great environment overall.. I recommend any young teenager this job because the hours are good as well as the pay
good,"great for gaining cashier/stock experience, whilst building conversational skills and customer service experience. and ofcourse the typical cleaning and up keeping of the store"
good,"Dollar tree is a fun job the pay & hours are terrible, however it is a likeable job for those who don't like setting around! Locust is organized. Cool"
good,The leadership team for this store are pleasant and motivated to provide an excellent store shopping experience for the customers. Individual skills are acknowledged.
good,"As the Operations Assistant manager I run the full aspects of the stores opening and closing shifts, I also create on a weekly basis the scheduling for all of the stores 17 employees."
good,I learned how to work the register. I learned where everything in the store was located. The hardest part of the job was having to deal with the mean costumers and standing around when no customers are checking out.
good,"A typical day at work was being responsible for customer concerns and provided information regarding products. Operated the cash register, and ensured the cashier drawer was accurate."
good,"They are nice to work with the managers are amazing, but one thing is that they shouldn’t call at 9pm at night, when their associates are trying to sleep"
good,"Dollar Tree is a good place to work for. The management is tolerant of incompetent employees, however. This can be aggravating when you're expected to pull the weight of others. "
good,Dollar tree is a nice company to work for however the expectations of the store manager role exceed the amount of pay you recieve. I reccomend a role such as store manager to someone with an open available schedule.
good,"Good job, loved work. Was dedicated."
good,Always a variety of customers to interact with. Various job duties. Downfall is cashier positions are very part time hours. Shifts are usually only 4 hours. Close to minimum wage.
good,Dollar tree is only good to get back on track. i would only recommend Dollar Tree as a temporary job. The job was very easy. Id have to say the hardest part about the job was the online training/testing you have to do before starting.
good,Made sure you were fast on your feet since it was a busy place and the management didn't want people to be on the line for too long. It would just create customers to leave or make the store more mess and crowd.
good,"Stock and replenish the shelves according to store guidelines."
good,its a cool place. You get to meet lots of new unique people. A bonus is the fact that you can be one of the first people to see all the shipment and product that comes through the store
good,Dollar Tree is over all not a bad place to work. There are good days and bad days just as in any other jobs. The work load is steady and call ins are an almost constant. Hours very week to week. Customer interaction is pleasurable most days.
good,The dollar tree was a great place to work at. had great people to work with but the manager turn over was to high and the leadership and quality of management was unreliable.
good,"I was hired just as seasonal but I actually really enjoyed it.  It was so busy and it made the shifts go by so fast!!  And the staff at the store were awesome!!!  I would go back to work, absolutely!"
good,if you start out as a cashier you must be able to stock merchandise and run register. It's a fast pace place. It has to be fast pace so you're able to get the customer out quickly and swiftly so they don't have a long wait time through the line and they have a friendly fun time during their shopping experience. You must replenish the merchandise on the shelves so the merchandise is also full for the customer to be able to find what they are looking for.
good,Fast paced fun place to work. My manager was a team player and gave out his own incentives for the cashier's every week. Register easy to use proper training was given. Was taught how to stock properly rotate unload truck pull stock
good,"I think dollar tree is a stable atmosphere with potential growth aportunity , I worked as a assistance store manager. The pay was not greet but was a good experience."
good,"Dollartree is a good part time job. Retail is not really for me but i like working at dollartree. They are flexible with there hours n days. Alot of recovery, gobacks n stocking. Keeps u busy"
good,"I feel that working at Dollar Tree was a first good job. Although, there’s not much of a future there as you can’t advance that well unless becoming a manager. The hours were also not that good either."
good,"To much work for little pay, not a consistent staff, every week there’s someone new there, no hours for workers, no discount, bad management and customers like to mess the store up"
good,"Managers are required to handle their building. Minimum 48 hour work week but will always work 50+.  During Q4 and holidays 60-70 hour work week. Minimal management staff for support. Hires in at entry level, minimum wage so must be able to train and retain associates. Physically demanding job with minimal office work. Small box retail in a fast growing company."
good,"I enjoyed working at Dollar Tree, the people I worked with were amazing so friendly and welcoming. The only downside was the location. Constantly dealing with thieves, drunks and panhandlers reason for my leave. Despite of the downside I really liked working at dollar tree"
good,Even though it was my first job it was a great company to work for and I learned a lot from it and I did a lot of counting money and our customer service was great but I think the company could use more employees.
good,"Dollar Tree is a fun place to work at. Keeps you busy, the customers are fun and sometimes challenging. I love my managers, they are great to work with. But it does not make ends meet. Financially this is not the job to take for money - you take this job because you enjoy it and don't care about the money. So it would be a great job for those coming out of high school not ready to start working full time or those in retirement just needing some work time to keep them busy."
good,management is always changing. if you like meeting new people everyday then this job definitely gives you the opportunity. taking breaks are not always on time but they are good about making sure you take one.
good,The training program is unsurpassed to any that I have experienced. The company has many incentives to encourage managers and their employees to do their best.
good,"The work place was good, The hours flexible if given enough notice. I liked the loyal customers and the happy environment. The work task was easy to get the hang of."
good,"Flexible work hours, friendly coworkers, Fast pace environment,  Dollar Tree is a great place to shop. They always have most, if not all, of the things i happen to need."
good,"Working at Dollar Tree was a great experience as my first job in the retail industry. They were great about working around my school schedule. The management was good. When you are an associate you typically only work 3-5 hour shifts at a time. When you work a four hour shift, you are required to take a ten minute break during your shift. A typical day at work was usually busy, but when the store was busy it seemed like my shifts went by faster. The hardest part about working there was remembering where everything was located in the store, so when customers asked where something was I could inform them. Around holidays like Halloween, Thanksgiving, and Christmas, the store is constantly very busy."
good,Great place to work. The management staff is a great staff to work with. They are very understanding and can work with you if you need a certain day off. Working here has been a great privilege because I get to meet all sorts of wonderful people. The only downside to working at Dollar Tree is that your pay is minimum and get paid biweekly.
good,As a stocker my shifts went by quickly with no problems. The other employees including management were respectful and helped me with anything i needed.
good,I truly enjoyed working there. I got along with all of my co-workers and actually looked forward to going to work. I was offered an Assistant Manager Position not long after working there. I had to leave my position there because I was moving unexpectedly.
good,Had a really good time there some associates an Managers was awesome to work with my manager was the greatest I've ever had taught me things I didn't no to make my job easi
good,"The place is clean and healthy environment. The minute i walked in everyone was very helpful on where to go. I didnt really get a walk of the place right away, and didnt know where to put my coat and belongings"
good,A typical work day is coming in on time to count your register and being ready to stand for the next 5+ hours. You walk around the registers through out the day and keep the aisles clean for yourself and the customs. And always stay aware of the customs and be ready to help out. I've learned patience through my current empierce here. The management at times can definitely be a mess but over does pull through when they need to.
good,"Being a manager at Dollar Tree has given me many great skills towards my career. With that being said, the salary does not compensate well enough for the time spent at the job."
good,The dollar tree is a great job if you want a little extra money in your pocket. It is a relaxed work environment and you get to know most customers by name.
good,i needed a job asap and they were hiring. not a bad job if you like working with customers. management was awesome i couldn't ask for better. i would go back because just of the management. very respectful people
good,Love working there hours aren’t the best but the atmosphere is relaxed and at times could be stressful. There’s some room for advancement. Great place to work
good,Very relaxed workplace and good Management. Sometimes the trucks were rough and took a while but all together a good steady job and fast paced. All the managers liked my work.
good,As a current employee at dollar tree I have to say I love working here because it really is hard work as a stocker.  Only problem is the pay & lack of hours.
good,Dollar tree is a remarkable store with great products and great workers whom always seek the best for the store and thier co workers. I however need to advance in my life and move on to greater things
good,"For the most part it was a pretty enjoyable job. Never had an issues with the staff working there at the time, everyone was treated well with respect and provided an overall enjoyable workplace."
good,I was The assistant Manager of operation's The Head Manager was not a very pleasant person and took it as his personal duty to make thing much harder then they need to be.
good,"I was a high school student during this working era. I only worked part time, but the pay and hours were satisfying during that year. No complaints about the job, but if I were an adult at the time, the pay and hours would not have been satisfactory"
good,A typical day is that I worked from 12:30p.m to 5:30p.m I liked that shift because it went by fast and I liked the customers who came in. The work place culture was good I meat a lot of good people.
good,Fun place to work. Some days are busier then others. Ta all prt time. You only get between 12-16 hours a week. So you would need another job unless you are management. The managers are fun good people.
good,If you don't have a lot of job experience or need something part time to add a little to your wallet. I would recommend working here. If your looking for full time and something to make a living off of I would suggest you look elsewhere for employment.
good,Working at dollar tree was a great experience. All the workers were good and friendly. The management was good. Able to work around the schedule that is good for you.
good,"Very fast paced environment , new challenges and opportunities to grow everyday , good benefits including medical benefits and stock purchase plans for all associates"
good,"When I first started working for the company, I enjoyed working there."
good,I left due to policy issues but they had fun people and a great team. It really matters which store you work for because some managers are unreliable. Find a manager and team you can get a long with.
good,"Pine Bluff store across from walmart is under new management and is definitely a full time job!!  The store used to be nasty, dirty shelves, no product out and rude cashiers.  However its beginning to really show change.  You are greeted as you come thru the door.  The people on the floor are very helpful in finding product.  Dont get me wrong-it still has a long way to go--mainly with all the boxes on the floor making it difficult to push your cart down an isle--but it is showing improvement!  The manager is AWESOME and makes it a very ""friendly"" atmosphere  to work in!  Keep up the improvements!!"
good,I liked working at Dollar Tree a lot there were some moments when I had a hard time but mostly it was a great place to work at we were like family the store team is like so small that you can form personal bonds with each other and I love the way that we look out for each other even though none of us was getting paid good
good,I loved my job at dollar tree just some stuff happened in my life and was unable to work there anymore it was cause anyone i worked with cause everyone worked as a team
good,dollar tree is a chill kinda job to have nd does have a friendly environment about it. nice employees with good attitudes to be around. but unless your management u only get a few hours nd days a week
good,Everyone I work with is very easy to get along with and I really enjoy working there. I’m just not receiving enough hours which I need for expenses I have.
good,Its a good compamy to work for. There are plenty of ways to grow with the company. Cashiers and stockers cant make a living working there and only there. But management makes decent money.
good,right fit for a person with drive to be successful.must be organized and plan your day well. can be stressful at ties of the year. training is key to success.
good,I loved working with the public I only wished that I could have been given more work days within a week. I was impressed about the team work my coworkers always contributed and always had great coworker communication.
good,I really enjoy my job at the dollar tree its laid back and easy for a second job I enjoy all the people and my manager is awesome! very flexible with my hours allowing me to work around my family
good,on the daily we had to meet tasks unload trucks and stock within set timeline hardest part was working during holidays because of extra orders on truck
good,"Dollar Tree was a good part-time job to get by while working there for 10 days straight. I learned through that job on how to stocker and restock shelves. The management was good. Nothing was really hard of the job, but it was enjoyable to get to communicate amongst another."
good,good place to work but managers need a better pay. everyone i work with gets along with each other .needs more than two workers at a time especially when its busy.
good,"The typical day was standing at a register waiting on customer purchases and/or stocking front area. I learned how to deal with stressful people and situations which did sometimes occur. Managers largely wanted you to just stay busy. Culture was fine in that as long as you did your part there wouldn't be any problems. Hardest part was when it would get busy and hectic."
good,I had fun at qork.  This is a great job for high school students but doesnt pay enough for living wage or those in college. All retail needs to pay their employees more.
good,Dollar tree hires cahsiers part time only with flexible work schedules. Very little room for advancement and hardly ever any raises. However it is easy work
good,"Was a great place to learn how retail works, they let you learn all aspects of the sales floor and the register. Laid back atmosphere. Learn how to handle money."
good,Great job .great team work. Good pay for the manager position. I was only part time. But the hours were always there. They are dependable and understandable for family emergencies and current thing that happen.
good,It was a very slow paced job. It never really got business. I was a cashier and sales associate. So I handled all transactions. Kept the front end cleaned and stocked
good,Help is always there if you get overwhelmed. The management staff is the most understanding and helpful I've ever seen. Work pace varies by time of year but mainly consistent. Cashiering and stocking is most of the job. The hardest part of the job can be feeling on the spot since you usually work alone. The best part is getting to know everyone. Dollar Tree tends to have a close community with it's regular customers. But not much room for advancement or raises.
good,I learned in the job you need to be on time and ready to work. The hardest part was the heavy box's but overall I do enjoy this job and I do recommend.
good,"dollar tree is a fun place to work. the hardest part of the job is unloading the truck. Manager is very easy to work for. the store is clean, well kept."
good,It was hard work unloading trucks n pricing inventory labeling cashier but I learned it all everyone was so nice to me n I made some good friends on the jo. My boss kool
good,Management was very flexible with working on my schedule and was very understnand when I have to leave. I learned that communications is a key role in a work place to keep each employee on the right page with each other.
good,"Dollar tree is a good job overall, I would recommend to a friend, but they should raise they're pay rate. The management is good as well. The company should also upgrade the store."
good,"Not a comfortable environment to work in, very low hours and no progressment happening within the company, very low pay. Managment was not flexible and treated coworkers poorly."
good,I love the people just not enough hours to survive. It's a great environment. Very fast paced but makes the time fly by every day. The major problem is not enough hours. Employees are lucky to get 16-20 hours a week Even in management positions.
good,"Working at dollar tree is a fast pacing task wherein it enhance my agility even more in work place,competitive.I have a wonderful experience with my job.The Management are skilled and well professional,I believe there is no hard part of the job for i tried my best to assist my customer in the best of my ability and knowledge.The most enjoyable part is when the customer acknowledge my type of service and skills that i rendered."
good,"Working at Dollar Tree was a very good experience. As a stocker, I helped set up merchandise as well as keep the store clean. The people there are very friendly."
good,I worked as an assistant manager at the Dollar Tree. The store was usually a busy atmosphere. Most shifts went by quickly since there was always something to do.
good,"A typical day at Dollar Tree meant I came in, got a till counted, and immediately switched on to the registers. It was often quite busy during the day. I was often also responsible for managing any requests from the balloon counter, and could frequently be the first contact point for any customers in the store. I also needed to assist to in stock count and in refreshing stock while working at the registers. I had a limited number of times I could make mistakes while ringing. We were restricted to 3 line voids per month, and that included if a customer changed their mind on an item. However, coworkers are generally friendly and the managers are helpful. If I ever needed help it was always given quickly. I also spoke to many new people every day, most of whom were friendly and patient. It's a good way to introduce someone to the retail business."
good,It’s a great first job or part time job. Not really recommended if you need to support yourself or a family. The pay is minimum wage but a perfect job For first timers
good,Managment team was great and the work was fairly easy. The only con was the pay was not great. This is a great job for someone who is in college as you need to be 18 years old.
good,My mangers are great. There are team players. The store is great to work for as they have flexible hours. They just don’t give enough hours. No more then 20 hours a week.
good,"As a manager the hours are crazy especially if you have young kids i worked from noon until closing and NEVER got to see my kids, this ended up being the reason i left a company that i like benefits aren't great , but if you like staying busy this is a great job for you!"
good,"I enjoy working for Dollar Tree, the hours I receive is not enough for me to take care of my daughter. When I ask for extra hours they try to find hours to give me.  They call me when people call in sick for work."
good,"A typical Day at work I had to fix one of the most difficult sections to fix and I honestly didnt know where to start so from that day I learned that its best to start off just grab an empty cart and to just pull everything off the shelves so that I can start fixing everything much more than great. Management wise I can say I dont know it all but I can say I did learn that it is a very big responsibility you chose to persue and a huge responsibility you were givin as well. the workplace culture is really good there is definitely a lot of leadership, and appreciation. The hardest part of the job is honestly being the only person recovering the store because it customers just throw items anywhere in the store rarely they put items back where they belong so as me being the only recovery person its hard to do all the work alone that shift. what I most enjoy is my 10 minute break & helping customers."
good,"The flow of work depends on the time of day. It can be busy the majority of the day with a few slow periods in between the rushes, they start around 10am and end close to 7pm. When its slow, working together is key to making sure many of the daily tasks get completed."
good,Gave me the chance to learn basics of management and training of employees. Learned how to close the store and manage finances during shift. Learned customer service basics.
good,Good place to work at if you don't mind hard work(stairs and heavy lifting).Most of the management is good some of the employees are hard to work with
good,"Very busy, lots of customer interactions in an ongoing retail environment. Amount of payroll hours to do the job has reduced or stayed the same even though sales have significantly increased."
good,Work store each day to ensure all areas of operations were being followed. How to mutil task. Management had unrealistic expectations of the work load for the store personnel each day. Very sales driven. Trying to juggle right amount payroll for each location. Management meetings.
good,This job was by far the best company I've worked for. I loved the atmosphere and the employees were great. Customer service that I was able to give was always good due to good management and time management.
good,"I loved my employees. They made everything better. As a cashier, you had to work under pressure, stock merchandise, and also run your register as well as giving outstanding customer service. $8.25 is not worth all the pain it puts on your physical and mental health."
good,"The dollar tree that i worked at was the one on pueblo blvd. It seemed to always be busy. There wasn't a lot of down time. The bad thing about it was if you had the closing shift, it would only be you and the manager. So when people got off work and came in. You would have the longest lines every. Which would make it a little stressful. But over all it was a great place to work."
good,"A fair place to start with but not a long term work you are looking for. Too much conflict between store and upper manager. Sometimes when coworker called sick, it is hard to recover the shift."
good,fast paced work environment had to have a clear mind in order to complete all tasks given to you. pay was not enough for the amount of work they expected to be performed.
good,People at dollar-tree were very nice to work with always friendly and positive to be around. Always had steady flow of work to be done. Nice and positive work atmosphere!
good,I would say that Dollar Tree was a great place to work.  I had a great manager.  The customers were very nice to work with.  It was only 5-10 minutes from where I lived at the time.  Overall it was a great place to work.
good,Good I got a chance to learn alot of different things more in details of retail it was and all around learning experience if I had to encourage anyone to work for this company it's a good company to work for
good,it's not hard work and hours are flexible if you can put up with people it's a good way to get a little extra cash. the management is fair. when you need time off they are very understanding of the situations and will work with you on it.
good,"The work is demanding, and often very physical. Daily/ weekly production standards must be met. The company offers paid benefits, as well as paid time off."
good,Not a bad place to start out in retail. Clean store. How to please customer even if they are in the wrong. Mixed culture. Truck day. I have wonderful co workers.
good,"I encountered people from the surrounding community and from all walks of life and all levels of education. Each day is challenging especially during major holidays, and creating a functional work environment to ensure customers are able to locate store products according to their personal needs."
good,"A typical day at Dollar Tree is to get in at 6am and open the store. Clean up as much as possible from yesterday's closing. After we are open and our cashiers are on the register. I would head to the back to check on inventory and also load and unload shipments. Throughout the day at Dollar Tree it is very consistent with customers. There is always something to do so we stay very busy. One thing that I have learned is the best way to deal with all aspects is to stay on top of things. For instance, do not let your stock room pile up. The faster you get it out on the floor, the faster it sells. Also, do not let you lines get long, always if possible have multiple cashiers. And the biggest thing I have learned is that you have to be willing to do any and everything. You must be very versatile and can wear all hats."
good,"I liked working for dollar tree because everything was a dollar so pricing, markdown, discounts, returns etc. were not thing I had to deal with. Very fast paced environment. The location I was in was a high volume store."
good,"I worked at dollar tree for only a year and a half although they don't pay as much and usually they have less break hours and more work hours. but overall, it's a good start for anyone that is looking for a low income jobs that could help them increase their income."
good,"Very nice and friendly  environment,but short staffed and under paid employee's. My time there was very interesting and sometimes challenging when we where short staffed."
good,"Let me just start off by saying when I stated there years ago I didn't think that I would end up becoming a manager after 3 short months and my boss was the best ever. I was able to work around my life being a single mom one car living back at home but it all worked out. So I started working there to do the rebuild of the store putting carpet squares in, then set up the isles, then shelves I did layouts with pegs and bins to set the store up. They kept me on as an overnight stocker and throughout produced in every area there was it was the best job ever I thought.  Unloading shipments to the warehouse and then pushing it out through the store I was always on the go. Management 3 months in and there was so much to learn and take in but I'm a fast learner so it all worked out. Learning the computer schedules: make, change, fix. Opening and Closing the store both front and back, knowing the alarm codes and shipping orders, taking in orders from outside merchants. Money count in and out, count money to start the day and make tills, take money to the bank, help out the guests as needed, cashier, clean up go back, stock, just all around fun never a dull job."
good,I love the customers. This job is intensely fast-paced. Must be able to lift 50+ pounds repetitively. Must have great patience with customers bad attitudes.
good,I worked as a stoker mostly early mornings we would sometimes have an overnight if it was before a big holiday or something. I found stocking the store to not only be enjoyable but relaxing there was not really a set planogram so it was nice being able to actually move things were they look most appealing. The pay for sure could have been better but in all honesty it was a very easy job and minimum wage seems fit.
good,good to be in a good and clean working environment not really challenging always happy to work smile at customers and love solving solutions and love my customers to be satisfied
good,"Learned how to unload a truck, and read stickers from company to know what everything went, cleaned store, zoned the store, cashier during the day time hours"
good,you work full time that is 25 plus hours. everyone is a part time worker except for the store managers and shift managers. you do get breaks but they are short breaks for 10-30 mins
good,Overall it was a nice place to work at I liked the environment and enjoyed working with other companies workers I also liked the fact that it was a fast paced place and I enjoy helping out the customer wether it be checking their purchases out or helping them find items.
good,A typical day at dollar tree I would go in go to the back to get my boxes go back out on the floor and start stocking my shelves until it's time to go.
good,"Management is great treats staff with respect. Enjoyed helping customers. Great experience, staff treat each others with respect. Clean environment. Very considerate of staff."
good,The management team was one of the best I have worked for. Everyday was a good day at the Dollar Tree. 
good,"I enjoyed working for this company. It was laid back & the Manager & other employees were friendly."
good,Busy at either stocking on running the cashier. Easy job to handle. Managers are well to work with. work is flexible to ones individual standards. the hardest part of the job is unloading the truck.
good,i was always excited to go to work every time i was scheduled..very enjoyable place to work.just have a concern about management .very easy fast and slow pace environment.
good,"Working for dollar tree is a rewarding experience. The company drives a positive, customer focused atmosphere. Although it is high paced, and some upper managers are better than others, and it can be stressful, the benefits are extremely helpful especially in this economy. Whether this company is a stepping stone to something else, or a permanent employment, the experience is well worth the time. A job is a job, it has its ups and downs, but the ups definitely outnumber the downs. My only complaint is the higher you progress, the less time you have to focus on yourself and your family."
good,"I started with Dollar Tree as a seasonal cashier and made my way up to freight manager. I throughly enjoyed my time working for Dollar tree, and would go back if the opportunity arises. We had a great crew in the stores I've been apart of, and that makes a difference. If you have bad management or workers the environment can be a challenge, but for the most part everyone I worked with enjoyed their job and we had a great atmosphere!  Unloading trucks and merchandising could be stressful, as corporate set unrealistic timeframes for processing and we had limited hours to work with. Scheduling could get tricky in summer with vacations and call offs and requests off, and Christmas is well Christmas so don't expect to have a life around those times! But for the most part it was easy to request time off and be granted it. They are constantly opening new stores, so advancement opportunities are there. Pays low and you're only given a raise on your anniversary date unless you are the store manager or full time assistant, then you are subject to review for a raise."
good,"fast quick customer service,learned to be fast and efficiant and keeping customers happy. Managment was ok. Hardest part of the job was black Fridays and holiday shopping.Best part was keeping the customers happy and coming back"
good,"I liked working here as a part-time cashier/stocker because it was a relaxed environment and not very demanding. The management staff was straight-forward with their delegation, but could me more friendly. The job was very simple and I think that is why I liked it so much at the time."
good,"Store is usually busy, so you don't have to worry about being bored and when its not you are putting things together. You have some really nice customers and then there are the few that really know how to ruin your day."
good,Dollar Tree is a very fast paced place to work.It can become stressful at times. I don't believe they pay fairly. Their managers are overworked with little pay.
good,"its immediately fast paced since only one cashier so all responsibility of customer service put on one person which is lowest pay and lowest hours. However, can lead to advancement in employment"
good,It seems Dollar Tree was a pretty alright place to work unless of course you want hours. It never occurred to me why they wouldn't just keep a few people for full-time instead of dividing up the work hours through out the week.
good,its a easy well paste working enviorment with great team members with lots of great attuide. great place to also shop. non heavy enviorment all easy going paste job
good,The workplace culture is stressful at times as you have to continually keep up with set quotas but the overall experience was great! Salary could have been higher but the job security is good.
good,"Manager- head manger; was very harasser, sexually, and verbally. Assassinate manager was very kind, kept the place going, been trained by for temporary management, well under pressure. Working environment was always fast pace, everyone was flexible with shift coverage, and good communication."
good,I liked working here. It was a clean environment and directions were clear and was made easy to work efficiently. Management was professional and very helpful.
good,Dollar Tree Management is pretty fair with hours I'm pretty flexible with what you have going on in your personal life. What I enjoy the most working at Dollar Tree is the customers and the interaction with them. I love our regulars.
good,As a dollar tree employee we always clock in at the computer. where I then get a til to have a register to work at. the work place was always a positive environment. the most I enjoy was the customers
good,"If you're looking for a quiet calm place to work in, this is your place, the coworkers were very nice to me and taught me how to do everything very well, my first manager was the nicest guy in there."
good,Dollar Tree was a great place to work. If they were to pay the employees more i would have loved to stay and continue working for them. The hardest thing about working there was having to be on your feet for such a long time.
good,Easy day learned how to run a register mangers were nice and helpful most of the time hardest part of the job would be trying to help time pass when it was slow and most enjoyable would be ringing up the customers
good,A typical day at work is where I go in and I either ring people out then if I have time put things that people didn't want or they just leave it around the store. I also clean up the store and if the other cashiers on need back up I help them. The hardest part is when there is nothing to do but I got to find something to do so I don't just stand there doing nothing. They don't like that. The most enjoyable part of the job is when we are busy because I rather be busy than not do anything.
good,I would help unload the trucks on truck day and from 4am-8am the following day I would come into put up stock and then I would sometimes come back at 1 and work until closing. Normal days I worked about 4-6 hrs.
good,"The best thing about my time with Dollar Tree company was the opportunity to help open one of the new stores, my coworkers were great but left the company to explore other employment options."
good,"I've been told by customers, They Love my People skills. I do enjoy working with People. I'm a People person. "
good,"I worked at two different dollar trees. I loved my job and majority of the people I worked with. Customers were always friendly, co workers were just as friendly. The only issue I had was with management and how I was treated. Everything was good until then."
good,"Part time positions only unless you get into management, not a bad place to work it is quick paced and easy going. Customer based so always have to be friendly."
good,Its a great place to work and I like my managers alot. I have a good time working there I just wish I could get better complication for my hard work. I need to find a better paying job
good,"It is retail so you work weekends, Holidays, and odd hours."
good,"A company that makes a difference in the lives of the employees and managers, and the customers we served.  Stream-lined organizational processes, fast-paced, and exciting."
good,The job itself is working with the public which i really enjoy. I enjoy my coworkers and I appreciate how they work with my availability. There are always thing to do. Restocking the store does give me a feeling of accomplishment that is a good feeling at the end of my day.
good,"As with most cashiering jobs, not much is strictly required but I enjoyed telling jokes to all the customers that came through. Management usually enjoys furnishing the store and dressing up for holidays and events. The culture is positive and most customers are generally relaxed. Cleaning the store can be quite tedious as merchandise is often overstocked on the shelves and hangers break sometimes spilling into the isles and the vacuum that is provided by corporate is sub-par, but help is easy to find during the down times. If you like to talk to people while you work (so long as you continue to work), Dollar Tree is an excellent part-time position. Note that it does get busy at Christmas and other holidays so college students need to be aware of exam times and know that they will be asked to work more during those times."
good,"Dollar tree store for me was a nice place to work, because it was small, not like Walmart at all! I enjoy working with loads of people though, they space there was just right for me is all. I always stayed busy, dollar tree is a very on going busy store, sure does keep the money flowing! I never had a problem working at a Dollar Tree Store, I really could say I got m worked done, and was nothing more then a focused person when it came to my job!"
good,"Very likable environment. Easy-to-learn, and not very physically demanding. Friendly management and employees, however they do have a problem with people actually showing up. Prepared to be called in a lot."
good,"Good place to work if you are a student. a typical day would be counting your till, starting right away at the register, multi-task: be at the register and organize or stock little things. Easy Job."
good,Don't have much to say. It's a job. Get paid every two weeks. Management is pretty cool. They don't offer a lot of overtime. Benefits are pretty good.
good,Dollar Tree management that I had was amazing. Would probably still be there today if I was able to. Started off a seasonal worker but made F/T manager within 6 months. You will get out what you decide to put in at this company. I think they need to pay their managers more $$$.
good,"Very friendly staff, the work is easy once you get the hang of everything. Dollar tree offers very good prices, and you don't work by yourself all the time."
good,"Best place I've worked so far, but that was probably because the people were so nice. Very relaxing and enjoyable work experience, I just kinda did my own thing."
good,"Has pros and cons just like every job. "
good,"Although during holidays it may get a bit hectic , it's never to the point where it's stressful . Management is very productive in helping run the registers if there's a large crowd of individuals."
good,When I worked for this company for the most part it was great but I kept having to prove myself to one manager after another to try and get promoted higher up. Work for this company for years and felt like I was used and over looked.
good,I liked it.  I really don't have much to say about the job. It was rather easy and I was just leaving high school. So it was something good to start with.
good,"I enjoyed my time with Dollar Tree this is a good company, my only reason for leaving was the lack of family time. I started my day at 7:15 am and usually didn't end until 10pm. On days off I usually had to go in due to the constant call in from associates."
good,I worked in a change from a Deals to a Dollar Tree transition... There were multiple projects that needed a do it yourself attitude and they gave you all the information needed to complete the tasks safely and correctly in a positive atmosphere. Great management.
good,"I enjoyed working at Dollar Tree, the pay was terrible but I really liked the people I worked with. I felt like I really made a difference there with the hard work I did."
good,"It was my first job I was so excited, I had to learn things quickly, there was no time for mistakes you have to do many things at once street customers be cashier, keep the front area clean, help people out, inflate balloons."
good,"Great place to work. Would recommend to others to work. Management is great. They really take care of their employees, Only bad thing is unless you are a manager you don't get full time."
good,"I have always wanted to learn the duties of a cashier, and here is where I finally got that experience. I loved working at Dollar Tree! Although it is no longer in Stratford I would like to return there again. But because of an injury, I cannot work in this type of environment anymore."
good,It wasn't bad when I worked there. They got busy around the holidays because everything was cheap there. Management was good never had a problem. Some of the customer's that came in sometimes were rude for no reason though.
good,"Honestly I worked once a week I the truckin department unloading the truck with products and toys and many other cool things that people enjoy that story I picked up cashier because  I got way more hours. Very laid back easy going job. I had fun while I was working at dollar tree. My boss at the time was down to earth easy to work for and always try to give me more hours to make up for lost time.i worked in beeville and lived a 11 miles in skidmore and we'll one day was not enough for me to drive back and forth nore did it look reasonable . When I took it I wasn't told that my hours where less then 15 teen."
good,"What's to say, it's a Dollar Store. Put the product on the shelves, and they sell them selves. Biggest problem is keeping the shelves full. Customers will buy anything that gets put out. If you can manage a store, and put out freight, you could be a store manager. Lot's of positions open for Assistant and Store Managers."
good,"Dollar tree stores are just a great place to be at when it comes to shopping, most name brand items are there and you get everything for a dollar. Being a employee I see how the prices and services help people leave happy and the fact they save 25 to 30 bucks on most expensive items at other retail stores like walgreens and cvs."
good,"Fast paced work day,  learned new technique for retail stocking, Management is easy to work with, friendly and ""light"" environment in the workplace,  the hardest part of the job is, stocking at the company standard is gruelling, and the most enjoyable part of the job is giving customers a great deal with there happy response to that deal."
good,I would say That i had loved it here. Maybe difficult at times do to some of the hours and pay but i generally liked it here besides the pay. Would say its for more part time people though.
good,"the job its self is not hard, you stock and ring people up the politics are rough on policies can be confusing having to do with sick leave was told cant leave store for breaks manager changes mind on things high turn over rate"
good,"While working at Dollar Tree there to be honest was never a dull moment. For the most part it is Fast Pace only due to customers wanting to be in and out in an efficient time. Working with some of the coworkers was okay. "
good,Dollar tree have some good people to work with i see alot of imperfections in this place the managers are bad and have no care for their employees and TERIBLEEEEEEEE hours
good,I love my store. Nice flow and less stress just not fond of the pay. I would recommend dollar tree as a part time job just not as a fulltime one . Do like the bonuses though !!
good,I enjoyed working at Dollar Tree. The store manager was amazing to work for and the other employees made every day a pleasure. My only regret was that I was not able to get as many hours as I would have liked.

good,Fast pace working environment.  Some very nice Coworkers. Very clean work areas.I really enjoyed working there. Everyone was so nice and worked well with others.
good,Working for Dollar Tree under management is fun and fast paced. The customers are what makes the experience worth it all. Coming into work you have plenty to do that will keep you busy your whole shift. As long as you like to work and enjoy challenges like i do then Dollar Tree is for you.
good,Working for his company was a great experience.. I have gained even more customer and communication skills. Being in this environment brought on a class of people id like to learn more from.. Thank you for the consideration for this job.
good,"For starters it is a very fast paced job. Cashiers have to be fast at cashiering and on top of that we have to refill restock. Management they vary, some can be very help full others don't. the culture and vibe are good i like working here. but when it comes down to everyone pulling their own weight, no one would pull the weight. but other than that i love working there the co-workers are nice and easy to get along."
good,Dollar tree is an great place to work at. The staff members are like family. The store isnt that big so you get a chance to build relationships with customers as well.
good,"Dollar Tree was nice place to work, I loved interacting with the customers. A typical work day is very busy I usually stay at my register until it slows day then I clean around my register. Then clean the front lobby, and recover the store."
good,Fast-paced environment but easy. Managers were understanding. It was nice to not have customers argue over prices since it is the Dollar Tree and everything is a dollar. Not for someone who wants to make a living.
good,I learned that you have to always try your best at work and always do what is right.  Do your job but also help others that are having a hard time with his or her job.
good,"It's a great place to work the managers are really laid back, they point out your mistakes in a well-mannered way. You don't get paid holidays, and they are never closed for holidays, that's the part that kinda gets me. But overall it's a grat company to work for."
good,"i loved working at dollar tree but the store manager that i had needed some improvement. i learned a lot about stocking, had awesome training tools online, my coworkers were great, the other assistant manager was great, we had a lot of regular customers that were really nice and funny."
good,I absolutely loved working at the Dollartree. I was a cashier. I stock the store's merchandise. My boss was awesome and the other employees were great and nice as well.
good,This was a good experience. I learned how to be a team member and that my job description could change from day to day based on the needs of the store.
good,"Nice place to work part time but depending on the manager you have can suck the life out of you. I always had regular customers, they loved me and I became good friends with a few, Co workers are great."
good,"I enjoyed the work environment, the other employees and most of the customers, however the location of the store was in a very hostile area where theft and some violence occurred. Other then that my experience working here was very pleasant."
good,"The typical work day was 9 hours shift.  I learned how to deal with high volume of units per transactions, and  enjoy working with supervisors and coworkers."
good,Was not bad for a first job. learned a lot here about the retail world and how to deal with customers. so over all not a bad place to work if ya need to make some money right quick.
good,"its a place where you can learn and you can grow"
good,It's a good place to work just the benefits aren't all that good and they're not very appreciative of their associates efforts. A lot of it has to do with the people you work with and how supervisors run it. Now don't get me wrong some of the people I've worked with are some outstanding individuals. I did still enjoy my job.
good,Dollar is a fast placed environment.Dollar tree expects alot from its associates and managers. The hardest part of the job is dealing with all the different personalities within the department. I have learned alot about myself and how to deal with different personalities.
good,"In  Dollar tree the compensation and benefits "
good,"Day to day at this store. I work on weekends right now and it starts with signing in to the register, counting the money in the till, waiting on customers, putting away stock, blowing up balloons, greeting the customers, recovery and bagging the items."
good,I enjoyed my time at dollar tree. The crew was easy to get along with and management was no less pleasant. I'd recommend to anyone looking for steady easy work; easy being with the team you work with. Be good to lift 50lbs.
good,National retail company with dedicated hardworking people.  Responsible and respectful employees that are encouraged to excellence with regards to customer service.
good,"A typical day existed of stocking and cleaning shelves, while waiting on customers at the registers.  Customers were pleasant and made the job fun.  I really like always being busy."
good,"come in and count my till, start cleaning up the store a little bit, walk around and see what needs to be stocked back up, ask customers do they need help"
good,"I enjoyed working at Dollar Tree however, the management was not favorable, she would let her emotions drive her attitude towards her employees. I liked the challenge of always being busy."
good,Great first job for the up and coming individuals in society looking to make some extra money and earn some job experience with some great work employees and hours.
good,Strong work ethic & family like work environment makes you feel right at home. Homely and inviting this is a great first job for anyone who is just joining the work force.
good,Dollar Tree is a great place to work for a first job or if you want a little bit more cash in your pocket. The only bad part may be the customers. Management is easy to get along with. Not many hard tasks. Great atmosphere.
good,"Good place for a first time job or Part-time."
good,"It's a good job, and usually the people are friendly, but the pay is minimal and there are not enough hours given. Also, they are usually pretty bad on keeping things stocked."
good,The Safety Manager will train you to operate the equipment which should take about a week to train and watch videos on safety the text is simple but after you are on your on you will have to keep up a steady pass
good,"o Supervised and provided training for associates and new employees"
good,An excellent place to work for those with a flexible schedule. The work is simple for the most part. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the occasional customer who may be angry or unreasonable.
good,"A typical day of work as a cashier would start with a brief discussion with my manager about the work I was expected to do for the day. Sometimes this would consist of the manager telling me what register I was working at and nothing more. Other times I would learn about another department that I was going to help for part of the day, or a project at the front that I was going to be in charge of. The days that I spent in other departments were usually right after large shipments, where my manager would need help getting as much merchandise to the sales floor as possible. The projects at the front were typically displays that I would be organizing or new promotional items that I would be putting up in place of old ones."
good,I loved working at the dollar tree. loved the people I worked with. Wish I would of got more hours.loved working with customer and helping people find what's they were looking for
good,"I enjoyed working there, and the management associates were always very pleasant and extremely helpful.  I have a very long history of retail experience so I really did not have much to learn there and was able to catch on fast."
good,I was a part time cashier and definitely enjoyed my time there. I loved interacting with my customers and providing awesome customer service.
good,"I learned how to work in an extremely fast paced and diverse environment, while being able to multi-task and continuously produce consistent and accurate results with my assignments."
good,My typical workday consisted of finding replacements for those who called out.Trying my best to stay in a low budget payroll.Trying to deal with five problems at once But I seem to work better under pressure.
good,"Greet cutomers at the door Stock items and store merchandise, Assist customers with locating merchandise, Sweep and mop floors, Preform other duties, as required"
good,"Loved busy days, stocking,changing end caps. OK customers. Management was great. Schedule was flexible. Other employees very reliable and family like."
good,Productive workplace environment. I enjoy interacting with my fellow team members and also my wonderful customers. Things get a little hectic around the holiday seasons but we band together and get the job done .
good,"Dollar tree can be relaxed at times, but I prefer the high pace because you stay busy and time seems to go by quicker.  I love the fact that Dollar Tree has everyday items to buy for such a low price and the store atmosphere is happy with decorations on holidays.  The hardest part of the job would be having to return several full shopping carts of items back to the appropriate isles, but it gives you a chance to learn what is in the isles and where items go.  Management and co-workers were fun to work with and helpful."
good,"Each day was different. As a manager I was constantly stocking out, helping cashiers and customers, and occasionally was a back up cashier. I learned a lot of problem solving skills as well as customer service skills. My coworkers were a good assortment of people. They all had their own skills in the store. However, the store manager was the reason I left Dollar Tree. The atmosphere of the store became very hostile and I chose to leave because of the store manager."
good,Great place to work and potentially move up in department wise. Many cool associates to work with but at times there is some brutal labor work at hand.
good,"First off,  I don't have a problem with the dollar tree I work at.  The only problem is they don't pay enough money. It's not a bad place to work.  I enjoy talking to customers, except the ones that have no respect. Its a good environment.  Keep it up."
good,"While working at the dollar tree i had to take orders while loading the shelves at the same time and would get in trouble if i didn't unload enough.Sometimes i would hve to help unload the truck and stock itin the back.But at night i had to cashier, clean the store,and put all misplace material back"
good,I enjoy working for dollar tree however I do think if they paid more and allowed more hours per employee they would have a lower turn over rate.
good,"There is always something to do, customers are usually friendly. Clean and probably stock sometimes. Its a low hours job thou only part time. You can get benifits but with barely any hours you cant really afford it,"
good,I love working at the dollar tree one of my favirote jobs that I have had it can get very busy and I like the fast paced environment
good,As a cashier at the dollar tree was wonderful I had a hard time at first to learn how to clock in and out but once I got that figured out all the customers and holiday rush I loved working there.
good,Dollar Tree is a great concept and company but due to its $1 price point the only way they can control cost is labor. This causes management to work 80 hours a week and make up for the lack of hourly employees. Within the last year they acquired Family Dollar and took on to much without a good plan in place and really spread our management team thin. I have learned a great deal working here. I'm proud to have developed and promoted more store managers in the Columbus region than all the other store managers combined. I have taken great pride in opening new stores and hiring hundreds of people and giving them a chance at a career with a growing company. The most enjoyable part for me is building relationships with our customers and working with them to meet their specific needs I also really enjoy helping my team grow and develop.
good,Help costumers around with different questions. Used my bilingual skills too.  Managment were strict when they need it to be and fun when it was need to be too. Friendly place.  The hardest part of the job was having difficult clients but you will jave to work around it to figure out the clients need so they can be happy.
good,enjoyed working with the public very much. I started as a cashier and worked my way to assistant manager within 3 months. Had a great boss and excellent co-workers.
good,My experience in Dollar Tree has been fantastic so far. I'm in a great environment with a staff willing to work and getting things done.
good,"fast pace retail store that sells only dollar items, excellent place to buy birthday and holiday items. they are open every holiday but christmas. they are a growing company with stores popping up everywhere."
good,"I  enjoyed working here until my hours were cut to nothing? I don't know why?Payroll cut? Busy store with managers that were great."
good,"They will work with you on jobs , good staff fun place to work , very clean on holidays always stock with merchandise people come there first before looking forward alway find someone to help you cashier friendly greeting"
good,"The work isn't difficult or strenuous, the customers are generally friendly and thankful and the staff gets along fairly well. not too much can be learned and the only ""difficult"" part would be receiving and unloading the freight truck since it varies from size, date, time and its done piece by piece."
good,Great place to work but management is kind of low rated. If you not apart of a buddy team or friends of managers than they'll try to get rid of you.
good,"I love my job but I love administrative work just as much. My is full of tasks that I need to accomplish and meet the goals I set for myself. I have a well set team that I've put together and we meet, as well as, exceed company expectations."
good,"I was a Cashier , I would ring up clients who came in to purchase items. I would answer every question the had and help them to the best of my ability. My Manager was a patient, reliable, and caring person who enjoyed her job. The best part of the job was helping out but the worst part was the hours we hardly got any hours."
good,"I ee"
good,"Fun and hard work environment but with the right manager who can do ""the talk and walk the walk"" it is fulfilling for the manager and the employees ."
good,i love dollartree. great people to work with .great prices .everything you need for just one dollar cant beat that . they get great things for a dollar like movies. they have a great freezer selection and its just one dollar . you would be suprised what u can get in there for a dollar.
good,"A typical workday consists of constant interaction with customers. Providing exceptional customer service is priority. From stocking the shelves to cashiering, the store must meet and exceed the customers needs. Management can sometimes be somewhat challenging for myself personally because I am soft- hearted in regards to taking disciplinary action (write-ups, etc.) against the associates. The hardest part of the job is balancing the work hours with parenting. The most enjoyable part is meeting new people and putting a smile on the customers faces."
good,Assisted the general manager with dollar tree sales while in high school and  continuing my education in the health care field.Fun work environment. Great place to work
good,I didn't learn much but to stay to myself and get my work done at a timely matter.I also learned how to work properly wit the public.
good,"First- hand experience with customer service, easy to jobs, and good atmosphere. Coworkers and management are easy to get along with and as long as you do your job well, the managers will take care of you."
good,I greet every customer and cashier 5 hour shifts. I stock shelves and unload trucks. I keep a steady pace to make sure I stay above goal for the day. the coworkers make it a friendly environment.
good,Fun place to work. Lots of challenges but overall a great experience that will help mold you into becoming a great manager. The staff are all hard workers.
good,"Being a cashier you do jsut more than scanning items and taking money. You learn how to make use of down time, such as straightening shelves up, sweeping floors/rugs stocking shelves or just helping a customer."
good,"Assist customers with locating merchandise, cashier, and recovery of merchandise for displays. I enjoy working with customers and helping my co-workers."
good,"Great opportunities to advance in the work place, management was very helpful and great in training, flexible showers, pay wasnt that great but within advancement there were raise advantages."
good,Cashing people out and sometimes restocking items on the shelves to sale. Something I have learned while at Dollar Tree was making sure your drawer is on point with the proper amount of cash.

good,Working in retail is great fun environment. I learn ho stocker shelves and greet customers. Its easy how balance the money and break it down at end of day. I gotten along with co worker and customers every day
good,"It's what you would expect. Grumpy workers, angry customers, drug addicts trying to steal, grudgingly slow at times"
good,"It was a good place to work and meet new people. The money wasn't enough for all the work you have to do in a day's time. A day at work starts with me opening the store or relieving another manager that open before me. I learned how to handle customers. The management is ok we just don't get paid enough. My co- worker did a good job for me I had no problem with them they did what I asked of them. The hardest part of the job was changing the store around from one season theme to the next with every holiday. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was meeting new people, and seeing them smile when they left my store after being helped and getting what they came into the store for."
good,"Start some days at 5am, checked daily paperwork, checked emails, checked that all tasked were comlpeted, if not found out why. Stocked empty shevels and cleaned store front. Had 2 full time Managers and a part time person. We had to ensure the store was full at all times."
good,"After punching into work, all the team members would work together to complete assigned work, such as stocking aisles and shelves with ordered items."
good,"Enjoyed the busyness of the job, I always had something to do, my managers were pretty cool, and the location I worked at were pretty flexible with my hours."
good,"Really enjoyed this company, great pay and benefits. Management is awesome, they stand behind their team. Excellent training program."
good,"I love the job, the managers and the customers. It gets busy and the time flies by. My scheduled hours are never set in stone because it gets really overwhelming for the new staff and I don't mind helping out. The pay is standard across the company but it would be better at a higher rate."
good,Everyday was a great day for me. Enjoyed all my co-works plus my managers we worked great together. Learned when a work place has great team work everything goes well. the hardest part of the  job was truck day. But other than that it was great work place
good,"I enjoyed working there. Everyone was helpful. I would recommend people to work there if they are looking for a part time job. It is easy to work at. Most customers were polite. Dollar Tree is a fun place to work at, but at times it  can get overwhelming when its a long line."
good,"You clock in, go to the back office, get a cashier till ready and then you count the till and make sure you have $100 to start your shift. Then you out your cashier in the draw and start your shift. Smile and show great customer service skills. I learned that patience is a virtue and that patience is key. When you show respect you will receive it back, Management is great, fun and easy people to work with. My co-workers are also great and easy to work with. The hardest part of the job is cleaning up the store the at the end of the day because people will leave it messy. The most enjoyable part of the job is just being around positive people and enjoying their company and also making sure the customer is leaving with a smile on their face."
good,good workplace it was just not a good enough pay but other than that It was real easy and fun and I loved that job. managers were always very understanding of others and really cared for customers
good,"I liked it there, it was my first job, and I became discouraged to easily. but the management is super nice and I enjoyed being apart of this company."
good,Great part time position to fill time while going to highschool as well as to learn the basics to customer service. Learn how to handle many different situations. Inventory experience is gradually learned as wells as store set up and organization.
good,"having worked for Dollar Tree off and on for over 18 years it can be seen as a dynamic ever changing , accommodating leader in the variety discount industry. If you have energy and are driven by results look no further the sky is the linits"
good,Enjoyed the positive environment of the store. Made friends with many of the employees. Store was relatively busy and kept clean.
good,"Dollar Tree DC  has a communication breakdown between manager and employee. Little to no training, lots of ""figure it out"" mentality. At the end of the day you move boxes into or out of the building and you have job tomorrow. Keep your head low and all will go well, make waves concerning innovation or procedure change and you mark and ""X"" on your back. Plenty of movement between shifts, job title or even to management. Word of advice some departments have a high turnover, others are very family style. Behave appropriate to your work environment and peers."
good,Fun work place The most enjoyable part of the  job is working by my colleagues and learning  from them. Not all about numbers and how you personally grow
good,"I went to work at 5am except for truck days.  I had a terrific crew of two to five people.  I enjoyed merchandising.  Unloading trucks was physically exhausting, but I would  get excited about new merchandise and how fast we could sell it.  The company was very happy and appreciated our hard work and dedication.  We did not have a lot of employees and ( customers) theft was a real problem,  That was a big problem especially at inventory time.  I did not want to be a store manager because they got salary and sometimes worked 60 hours a week for about the same money I was making.  I could always call my district manager if I had a problem my manager could not help with."
good,"Everyone is very helpful and the managers always make themselves available if you have any questions about the job. In the time I've spent here, I've learned a lot about how to merchandise as well as how to keep a stock room well-organized. This is also the first job where I've worked so independently of others, and its proven to me that I am perfectly able to manage my time efficiently. Overall an enjoyable place to work."
good,As a Store Manager at Dollar Tree you are expected to carry a good portion of the work load. You will be the only person in your store making above minimum wage and subsequently the only person who has a real investment into how the store succeeds. Dollar Tree Canada has had its share of growing pains and they continue to struggle to keep up with the growth.
good,"A typical day at work would be very productive with a smooth flow of enjoyment with all employees/managers, and very organized job controlled enviroment."
good,"Whether opening the store or closing the store, I was in charge of the safe on my shift. I set up tills or count them down for cashiers. I performed weekly audits. Stocked and recovered items. Worked as a team to complete task or I was able to work on my own on task. The hardest part of my job was keeping the store nice and tidy. The most enjoyable part of my job was my customers."
good,My job was to stock sheleves and the freezer and maintain. I had to maintain cleanliness of the stockroom and the entire store and also unload trucks on the truck day.
good,"A typical day at Dollar Tree is running a cash register or stocking the shelves. I have learned different ways to merchandise our products so we can sell those products more. My managers are awesome people to work with and they are very understanding people. I love working with my co-workers, and they are fun and full of laughter. The hardest part of my job I would have to say is the lack of hours. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to see the regular customers and being able to see them on almost a daily basis."
good,"not that much work, but have to deal with little things on a daily basis that makes it look bad. It is good place to start if a person likes to go by the rules."
good,Once the store is close me and my co worker stock all the empty shelves then me and my co worker at the end of the shift we clean up together.
good,"Nothing really got done at this store, everything was constantly a mess. I did recovery every night and by the time I would get there for my next shift, the store was awful."
good,i worked the cashier and stocked the store and cleaned up and unloaded the truck i got along with all the employees and just found a better job so i moved forward
good,"A typical day consist of making sure that everyone on the schedule is at work on time and ready to work. I learned how to balance the store safe, shutdown the store, manage over twelve employees, and multitask. The upper management were always willing to help if needed be. My co-workers were very respective of me and so I of them. One of the difficulties of the job was balancing time for employees to work shifts. My most enjoyable part of the job would be all of the different people i was able to be in contact with and brighten up their days."
good,This job was easy paced when putting product away on the shelves. Unloading the trucks that brought our product was more fast paced but not at all hard. The back room was highly disorganized and the store manager was extremely lazy.
good,"I loved working at Dollar Tree but the store manager just didn't seem to support her employees."
good,It is a great company to work with but it's lack of hours to be in and the environment are great to work as well. I would not recommend.
good,Work early in the mornings that way we can get the product out on the shelves before the costumer walks in to do their shopping.
good,"I loved working at Dollar Tree, it was my favorite job so far. The pay wasn't to great but my coworkers, especially my Manager, were the greatest!"
good,Good management. Helped to develop good customer skills. Decent work hours. I got lots of responsibilities in a short period of time due to my hard work.
good,"my typical day at work was fun 4 to 5 hours 3 to 4 times a week. i started here as an rop student so i didnt get paid because it was for job training only for extra school hours and experience. since it was my first job l learned how to mange go backs, and do recovery as well as help people out. job wasnt hard at all"
good,The enviroment upon which I worked was nice. The training was very thorough and the type of people I had worked with were wonderful.

good,"i work graveyard shift unloading supply boxes. fellow co-workers loved my strength enrgy and seriousnessand ability to get along with them."
good,"A typical day at dollar tree, also me being a cashier and seeing peoples smile always puts me in a good mood, during parts of the day i would have to say hi welcome to dollar tree to every customer that walked to the store, the hardest part of the job would be learning the cash register because this was the first store in which i had to do that. The most enjoyable part of the day would be being able to know where everything is because of the stores size so its easier to direct customers in the right direction."
good,"running a cash register,making thing clean, everything has to be stocked.the management was ok got along with most of then and the co workers some was good other ones lazy. working with custermer was most ebjoyable part of my day and the hardest was trying to make sure everything got done right!"
good,"I enjoyed working at the Dollar tree. I would get to work, clock in, count my cash drawer  and make sure there was at least 70 dollars in the drawer to start my shift. when I worked it was normally just me and my manager. I only worked with a select few people and never really had the chance to get to know them because we where always so busy. The hardest part of my job was probably going 8 hours at a time with out even a 5 min break. Other then that I cant complain, I really just enjoyed the employee to customer interaction and watching most of them leave with a smile on their face."
good,"-break down Pallets"
good,fortune 400 company with good benefits and bonus programs.
good,"A typical day at work can be very productive if I just work fast providing my best work,and helping customers to the best of my ability.What I learned about having this job is to just think things through and be patient when dealing with customers and remember many things as I work this job each day.The management can very understanding they work with you as long as your are dependable and do your part when working the job. My co-workers are nice and friendly we all help one another and work as team when we need to.The hardest part can sometimes be closing because sometimes it can be a lot to do but if you just work fast and hard  throughout your shift everything will come together and you can be out in time.The most enjoyable part is when you know helped a customer and they are happy with the customer service you provided."
good,"It was back in 2009/2010 when I worked at Dollar Tree. Back then it was very laid paid. You could wear whatever as long as it was within dress code guidelines. It was my first ""real"" job and I enjoyed it very much. The hours were easy and it wasn't hard to get a few more hours if they had extra to spare. I remember once, in September, I worked from open to close just because I wanted to. I was only scheduled for 5 hours that day but they had extra hours to spare so I worked the whole day and loved it!"
good,"Days at work were short but very easy, I enjoyed working with the public and suiting peoples needs. My job was very laid back, to laid back at times. I am looking for something more pressured and fast paced, also for advancement/ full time."

good,"the typical work day would be coming in to a daily meeting and letting all employes know how big the days drop would be. Then everyone got sent to their location. "
good,"The manager and my co-workers were nice, polite and easy to work with.It was a different environment,its occasionally busy but what i think helped me was I was a fast learner. I liked walking in and having list of duties I had to do. What I liked the most was that when someone is busy I kept everything under control. So they know they can depend on me."
good,Greeted customers as they entered the store and assisted them with finding what they needed. Rang up items purchased and took all forms of payment. Kept front end of store neat and put things back where they belonged when things became slow.
good,"Working at Dollar Tree is a great experience. Being with this company involves multitasking in a fast paced, friendly environment and can be quite rewarding to ensure the customers and employees alike are satisfied. It has taught me managerial skills, customer service, and to work independently as well as part of an energetic team. The most enjoyable part of the job is when customers leave happy with the store and I know I pushed myself to do the very best I could have that day."
good,The staff and management were awesome. If I didn't go into the medical field I would of been working there still.
good,Fun work environment. Unfortunately there is a lot of drama in this workplace.
good,To work up to my goal and to get in a company and to start my career and my skill knowing.  And to reach in the company and be happy what every I do and to be a lean person and to woks very hard as a team player.
good,The customers always seemed to be in a happy-go-lucky mood.  Which would always make me smile and put me in a good mood.  I didn't like being part time and only working for 4-5 hours a day not making much.  I got along with all co-workers well.
good,open/closed store and I learned how to run a store. management was cool to work with and I was friends wit most of my co-workers. The hardest part was inventory and I just like running the store
good,Great for someone who is just starting to look for a job. Someone looking for their 1st job.
good,"Dollar Tree was a easy job, being a cashier. The employees were all in good spirits at work. The manager was a very down to earth and understanding manager. Balancing working and being a single parent was definitely met at this company."
good,"greeted customers, kept items neat in order, refunded money, and other housekeeping duties. i loved all my employees the job was easy and fun i like working here over the holidays."
good,Management and satff made the time go by because they where great team players.
good,"My day at work is started by greeting the customers that come through my checkout line. Since working back in retail, I learned a different meaning of being patient. You still have to smile when a customer tries to ruin your day. There is no hard part to my job. I make the best of my job. I enjoy seeing my regular customers and the new customers."
good,"Fast paced daily. Especially during the Holiday Seasons"
good,"A typical day at work consisted of cashiering, I would also do the cleaning, stocking shelves and assisting customers."
good,"Work colleagues  make it a prime responsibility to put customers first. Everyone has vast knowledge where products are concerned. Store is well organized and clean, staff are friendly and competent."
good,Good place to work and grow and develop business knowledge.
good,I would clock in and count my drawer then start my daily routine which was make sure I had plenty of shopping bags stocked.  When I didn't have anyone in my lane I would go straighten up around the register for example make sure all the candy and other items were in the right place. The co-workes were very friendly and always there if I had a problem or question.  The managers were always there to help if a co-worker couldn't answer any of my questions.  The job was fairly easy and busy.
good,"As a cashier you will not only do that but clean the floors, some stock. working with the people is a lot of fun, the managers are there, the co-workers are like family, dealing with some rude people, but it is a good place to work."
good,they are good to work for but cant advance  they do pay good but they will write you up for just about anything my co workers are great 
good,"everything was fine working within the company "
good,At times we would work as a family & that way we would get our work done faster.
good,Sales Associates are only responsible for the register and the close proximity around it. They are not to go on the floor unless asked by customer. A short list of register duties are given in the morning. Moderate paced job with friendly co-workers. I learned how to use a money scale. Its a scale that can read the amount based on the weight of the roll or wad of cash.
good,"I enjoyed the positive working environment and friendly family oriented co-workers and management. Management was always understanding. It constantly kept me busy and moving with very few boring bits. On a typical day I went in stocked impulse items at the register, and fulfilling other duties while waiting on customers at the cash register. "
good,"On a fair day everything goes smooth.I learn that you have to stay focus at all times and you have to help each others stay on task,the hardest part was getting employee to put their request to be off in the box on time.I like working with people and the type of job i was doing."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is you are always active and the many different people I meet.
good,Dollar Tree is just a normal job going to work as a cashier or going to stock shelves. When I got to work I would go enter my name into the computer to let it know i am at work then i would get the manager to set me up on a cash register. I had to learn how to use a cash register and it was pretty easy and after so many hours i got a 15 minute break. and then i would go back to work and close the store. Management was pretty good. I like almost every co-worker that i met. Hardest part of the job learning to pace myself when there was a lot of customers in line to pay for everything they bought. The most enjoyable part was working on the cash register and meeting all my co-workers.
good,"It wasnt a bad job, there were definitely favorites but ive learned that you go to work and then you go home. "
good,Dollaar Tree was a job where everybody got along well. you were able to do your job and have funat the same time with the customers and your co-workers.
good,a great company to work for
good,Thejob started on thursday because that is when the truck comes in. We receive the truck and put all the merchandise in the proper aisle. So food goes in the food aisle and etc. We are given selected aisle which we are supposed to keep clean and rotated if need be.
good,"Worked as a cashier, I leared you need patience, the managment did there jobs by keeping everyone on track"
good,Worked as a cashier. management is good and the employees are nice
good,Hard work pays off. I was working with a group of friends but always concentrated on the work I was assigned and the manger was impressed.
good,"My co-workers are very nice people, as are the managers. I really enjoy the people that come through my line. My typical work day is about four and half or five hours and depending on how busy the day is, it goes really fast."
good,"A typical day at work consist of stocking, cleaning and running the register. Management was nice. My co-worker's were nice. The hardest part of the job was that it was very slow paced. The most enjoyable part was that it worked with family and school schedules."
good,"enjoyed the variety of branded items for low price, exciting new items arrive weekly. Love the fact that you can develop close relationship with your customers as the frequent the store weekly."
good,"A typical day at the dollar tree is trying to push everyday freight as well and cashiering, making sure customers have a good experience while they are shopping. I have learned so much for this job, i started there as just a cashier and now i am an assistant manager there. the most enjoyable part of the job is making the customers happy while they are there."
good,It was most work friendly job I had ever had. It was diffucult having 10 minute breaks but that was about the only thing that was that way on this job.
good,over all was a good work enviroment. managing employess was hard but do able also customer service was great had alot of incontering customers and solving problems they accured
good,"Stocking, Cleaning, Cashier assistance, balancing, inventory control. Not a terrible working environment just tight staffing with high expectations."
good,A typical day at work was cleaning everything and making sure everything was in place. Management was good always on point. My co-workers were ok people to work with. Hardest part of the job was working alone when it was a team work job sometimes. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing the work went well and I finished my job.
good,I love working at my local Dollar Tree but its very hard to pay my bills with what they pay. I personally feel like I deserve at least $2 more an hour. I bust my rear end everyday but corporate employees dont seem to care. My store manager is an amazing person and a wonderful boss. Corporate employees tell us a way we have to do things that just isnt possible. ie. putting 20ft of merchandise in an 8ft section. I also dont like how they treat people who dont do their job the correct way. There is no discipline.
good,nice steady place job at times it can be very easy but its nothing to hard that you can not handle
good,This company has compassion for the battered woman and the children that are involved. The staff is compassionate as well as management and staff work well to assist in finding all the resources the women and children may need to get back on their feet.
good,"it was my first job in high school i loved it, being 16 and wanting to start out good"
good,This was a really good place to work it was hectic and frustrateing at times but it was good work there is always room for advancement cause new stores are always opening up and they need people to fill them
good,"Dollar Tree has had some changes over the years. It was my first venture into retail management. At first i found it challenging, but after dealing with bigger retailers such as Big Lots, I have to admit that its really not that complicated. They do seem to value people, and utilize the skill sets of those they hire effectively, but they are handy capped by how many hours they are given, but this isn't something new in retail. I learned quite a bit while working for them, such as creative stocking, effectively merchandizing endcaps, as well as pro-active ordering. The hardest part of this job? Its really not that hard. The most enjoyable part of this job was completing a fourth quarter with an entire staff in tact and your back room managable. If you can do that your on your game."
good,"I would normally spend my day stocking merchandise, cleaning of the store after hours and helping customers on a daily basis. I learned that retail is often hard but rewarding. Management was very nice and accepting. My co-workers were easy to get along with. I believe the hardest part of the job was sometimes not being able to find what a customer needs and disappointing them. The best part of the job was being able to help people with their errands."
good,"enjoyed working hard,great people.Advanced quickly.Met my wife there."
good,"I learned a lot about customer service, and organization as well as how to keep my pace fast while keeping my work up to par."
good,"I enjoyed working at Dollar Tree when I first got hired, but then there was a change in managers and things started to go great to bad. Our manager was very unproductive, took multiple smoking breaks, and didn't have enough training for her position. People started to hate their job and the whole vibe of the store was negative. I'm still currently here but trying to get out of it very soon. I'm not comfortable here anymore."
good,"Good enviroment,all staff well mannered,people worked well together"
good,I began working as a cashier and greeting customers on to stocking shelves and making sure the store was clean and customers were tended to. Also that the store was kept clean. And my register came out equal/ even at the end of my shift.
good,"My days were easy, as a cashier when i clocked in, counted my till and rung people out all day. When we weren't busy i would help with stocking shelves, inventory(when it came around), cleaning, etc. From Dollar Tree i've learned how to handle and process payments, I've learned amazing customer service skills, and learned about the dollar tree company."
good,It was fun. The other employees were nice. There were a lot of responsibilities but it was worth it. The pay was okay..I think it could have been better but the benefits were good
good,"He’d been working as a dollar store at a lo. Driving shiny new cars around and hanging sold tags on them; a little buffing, a little balloon tying, a little tidying up. Sure, you have to have a clean driving record – and bring proof – and"
good,You always stay busy and have rushes here and there. Store location is key with what you will be responsible for in your store. They always want to make sure that it is safe around entire store for guest. Down fall is they expect you to do 40 hours of work on a part time position.
good,Really awesome place to work! My interviewer was extremely friendly and helpful. I love working at dollar tree. This could be a great job if you don’t have much work experience.
good,"The company has a fair share of problems but all in all it's pretty good. "
good,The people I work with at dollar tree make my whole experience there worth every bit of it. I love the job and the people. I would recommend this job to anyone.
good,It is a good company to work for. However pay is biweekly and also it is only a part time position unless you are management. If you need something to do on the side than this is the job for you.
good,Ringing up customers. filling shelves up. making sure that you clock in on time and out on time. keep track of your break time and dont go over your 10 mins. Be nice and always say hello and did you find everything that you need
good,Just not enough hourly pay or hours to be able to take care of a three person household that includes two teenagers. Management was nice and open to fluctuation of hours to maintain two employments just didn’t work out
good,"easy, fun work. customers are always friendly and happy to shop. most days I was the closing manager but I liked it. I would make sure store was well stocked, no empty shelves. then by the end of the night I would clean the store, while help the front end and customers."
good,I’d say depending on the seasons when working there it’ll have you working at a fast paste while other times it’ll be slow which was good for me because I got to see the difference in fast working and slow.
good,Not much to say. I was a hard worker. Handled my duties and don't get any raises. Hours got cut. So I decided to find something worth my time and experience
good,"Since dollar tree is known for everything having to be a dollar or less; we get in customers all the time. It’s a fairly busy place. We do occasionally get many different types of customers some good and some bad, but that’s just how retail works. It’s a very good job and very easy as well"
good,Pay is very poor. Good working conditions. Excellent management. Flexible hours. Would like more hours. The job is very easy to learn. I enjoy the customers.
good,"Fun work place with every single thing we sell in store, very nice customers, very close to my home, love my co workers and management we all get along fine. The pay not to happy about."
good,Everyone was warm and welcoming when I started and willing to help me learn every task faster and more efficiently.  Although it was the holiday season when I worked there things went by really smoothly. The managers and crew were very nice and outgoing
good,"It’ll be a hit or miss depending on what store you are located at, I have a personality that generally meshed well with everyone I worked with, and the management and my co-workers were generally all around nice. Don’t expect to be running in getting 27-34 hours a week tho as a PT cashier, unless discussed previously with management. My shifts when I worked there were 2-3 times a week during the nights mainly. It was very simple and straightforward. When holiday season came around the shifts would bump up to 3-5 times a week, mainly 3-4 though. 5 is normally when I had to cover someone’s shift. Speaking of covering shifts, you’ll probably have to do that at some point most likely. It really depends on your store and location to be honest. I lucked out with a good working environment with co-workers and managers, the customers were not that bad either. But I know other stores are not like this, so if you are applying at least get a sense what it’s like working there. Example, before you apply buy a few things and ask the cashier a question, “what’s it like working here?”, generally they’ll tell you if it’s okay or not. The biggest downside was the pay, generally minimum wage depending on your state with very small raises when I worked there, yearly. Overall my store was a good place and kind of like a second family, I still go in and visit every now and again. If you get a good store, things will generally go well, if you don’t... it’s probably going to be a miss then."
good,"I currently work at dollar tree and it’s not bad. However, we need more cashiers because we get pretty busy. The hardest part of the job is dealing with by the holiday seasons. People can get pretty rude around thanksgiving and worse around Christmas. Also, people trash the store all the time and don’t like waiting in lines for 5 minutes. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you see regulars that you like- they can make the day nice."
good,"I have enjoyed my employment at Dollar Tree. I just need something closer to home. The job is high demanding, but worth the added energy.  Under the right leader, you can have success."
good,"Its overall a great job just need more hours in a week and would be better if we got payed every week"
good,Its a good place to wk for but in my opinion the time that i was and still wking there are DM and are store manager left do to to much wk and not enough pay.
good,"Low pay, no advancements. nothing to look forward too. If 8 hour shift was given only a 10 minute break was issued out .. if you didn't take that 10 minute you where pushed..Management was drunk and rude"
good,It was fun. I enjoyed it. Good place to work. Laid back coworkers. Lenient dress code. Cashiering wasn't so bad or scary after a while. Bacon pancakes.
good,"Dollar tree is a great place to break into the retail world, great for internal promotion though other companies pay their managers more for the most part. Is pretty relaxed environment but as management you need to cover shifts if no one else can do it yet they do not like us to have overtime...go figure"
good,Working at dollar tree was a wonderful experience. my co0workers were fantastic and management cared about you as an individual. The only downside was you could not be scheduled for more than 20 hours per week.
good,"Working at DT was a great experience and I loved the customers and my staff. Pay couldn't been better, my store manager meant well. I learned how to better handle cash and time management."
good,"Dollar Tree was a really great place to work. Paid well, great coworkers and a very nice campus. My only recommendation would be to develop a more flexible schedule. Strict 9-5 is a little dated."
good,"Working at this company was great. But they lzt us go. Without said nothing . they suppose to explain that, no business then laid people off. That will be good"
good,Need more hours at dollar tree. Management was very poorly. Co workers were rude. Dollar tree location was very messy. And things very out of order. Rude employees
good,"I love my job there, just wish it was more an hr and wish we got paid every week not every 2 weeks  the manager is great and I live the people who I work with the store is very clean and we get a lot of compliments on how well our store is ran."
good,I love working For Dollar store in other States!I am going to To Spellman college I Have been doing well In ATl. Where I been gone or sleep They Are I liked Working For Them they grew into A nice company!!I like them!!!I love my job Their! The season was Really good nice people I know They are Nice caring people! I would work forWork work work
good,"Nice paced work environment,  lots to do and keep busy. Easy to get on your feet and understand what needs to be accomplished each day. With a nice variety of tasks to do."
good,I placed my first order with dollartree.com and it took roughly a week for my items to arrive at the store. I ordered bulk vases for my wedding. All were well packaged and undamaged. They even brought them out to my car and loaded them for me. Wouldn’t hesitate to order site to store again!
good,"Dollar tree was my first job. I was there for five years. Started off as a cashier, became a stocker, worker up to freight manager and then assistant store manager. I worked with an amazing team and my manager was super encouraging. She wasn't a softie she meant business but she wasn't such a Hardy that she couldn't teach you even when you made mistakes she'd help you correct them. Her mentorship was inspiring and long lasting"
good,"My managers were very impartial, fair and at the same time they always had words of advice and encouragement for their employees. If you needed extra help to reach your goal management was willing to find ways to help."
good,"Dollar tree is a wonderful place, if you can get in, ""on any level of employment""  I highly recommend you stick with it, the opportunity to move up is everywhere.."
good,There is all ways something to be done and your coworkers are nice. There is a set way of doing things but it's easy to understand. The job is great I had a good time working there.
good,I love working there. It's a great work experience. I love working with people. And I love having new tasks everyday and learning new things. Dollar tree is a great company to work for.
good,you came in to stock boxes usually more than 40 boxes then help pick up the store and see if theres any help customers need when looking for the item.
good,I've been a seasonal worker for 8 years and I plan to go back this year also.  I like working with the managers/employees and interacting with the customers.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to meet & interact with people of all cultures. Management is willing to work with you and truly care about all of the companies employees.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job:"
good,It was a wonderful job to work at. Team work. And cashier and stickers do they job. But sometimes we didn't get enough time on ourlunch just a 15 break.
good,"Dollar tree is a overall good experience. "
good,"Benefits were good... Medical, Dental, Vision, MSA, Discounts, and employee activities. Employee appreciation BBQ's. Met some really good people there. Thank you for the opportunity to work for your company."
good,Good place to get experience in retail and customer service.  Is a fast pase job you get sometimes so busy you don’t notice time goes so fast. sesonal items change all the time. So you have to stock that section all the time
good,Dollar tree is a good place to work. Management is dedicated and promotes a positive attitude. I was very happy with vacation benefits and flexible scheduling.
good,I’ve been working for dollar for quit so long this where I got all my costumer service skills and skill training from this job I am talking to costumer with different languages
good,"They are a good company to work for but they have some issues with keeping employees and at times not having enough hours to hand out or assign to do the necessary work. There were many days that hours were not available by the company to get the work they were asking for done and we had to ""shadow"" work..work off the clock."
good,"It is assigned as cashier support and work in the area to organize products or create and fill new hangers. "
good,My responsibility is to make sure my customers are satisfied and give good customer service to my customers and do other job duties if I didn't have any customers cause I can't just sit around and do nothing.
good,"I work at Dollar Tree and I'm so happy that they worked with me. The thing is that I have two jobs. This one is a side job they allowed me to only open on weekends which is a blessing, but a problem if this is supposed to be a main source of income. They have no full time workers save managers, so it would be a supplemental second job or bonus money for teens (you must be at least 18 to work here though. God bless."
good,I hate workin here then again I loved it so much because I shopped here I lot everything’s so cheap in afford able sometime people will get on your nervous but other then that it was ok not bad
good,"The manager was awesome, and very understanding. Like any other day it had its packed hours and dead hours, but not a hard job. Best part of this job is meeting new people and knowing you made their day with a conversation or even a hello."
good,"DollarTree was my first job, and it is a great environment for someone to cultivate those very important :first job: skills. However, moving up in the company isn't easy for someone with other obligations like school. You learn many valuable retail skills, as well as general customer service skills that can serve you well moving into other career paths."
good,As the Ast. Manager for Dollar Tree I have been able to improve the sales production at increase employee productivity on a daily basis. I was able to improve how the merchandise is being accounted for and distributed to specific location within the store.
good,stocking and getting cash register ready for store to open. I learn how enter a truck in the computer. i love bieng part of management. The hardest thing is not having a manager to have your back when a employee is out of order. The most enjoyable about my job is the customers that i have and got to know
good,"This job was very fast paced or very slow paced, as a cashier I often did not have anything to do if I did not have any customers in line, and I only worked part- time."
good,I enjoyed my time at Dollar Tree. The people I worked with were very friendly and easy to work with. I left only for better opportunities. I would greatly recommend Dollar Tree to someone who is looking for a part time job while in school.
good,It was a good place to learn before you go to a better paying job. The hardest part of this job was keeping items on the shelf. Customers love to shop and sometimes it seemed there wasn't enough employees and time to get everything done.
good,I enjoy working at Dollar tree because I like to help others and be the reason others may be smiling. I also enjoy the friendly environment that dollar tree holds.
good,I have learned so many things working here. It is definitely a great job when it comes to wanting to move up and further your job experience and career in retail.
good,"LIke any job you get the workers that work hard, the mediocre ones and the ones that find any excuse not to work and sit and talk. As far as manual labor as a cashier this job was very easy. The managers don't get paid enough for the amount of time and effort they put in there and hours are very limited for cashiers. Do not work here if  you depend on the income alone. I would only recommend it as a side job for extra money"
good,"Working at Dollar Tree was a much more pleasant experience than I had thought.  There was always a task to be accomplished and skills to be honed.  I learned how to organize merchandise on shelves, and also the basics of organizing a stock room.  My manager was an exceptional person who made even the most dreary of days enjoyable."
good,"I know it takes dollars-and-cents decisions to run a company... but when it comes to your data I think you should prefer shepherds (those invested in the company) over hirelings (contractors)."
good,"This job has taught me many things about the working world, I would stay but as the summary says, my part time position doesn't give me enough hours. Only real issue working hear would be the weekly scheduling, most of the time its not a problem, but it can be chaotic."
good,great team mentality managers who were willing to do the hard work with you to get the job done. fast paced but also laid back. good people to work with lots of work to be done so no time to worry about the clock so the hours go by rather quickly in comparison to some places.
good,"its exactly what you would expect. easy job, nothing to do but fix shelves with merch on them. very easy. if you dont want alot of stress this is a good job"
good,"Dollar Tree led me to experience the world for the first time. I applied back in November of 2017. My co-workers were friendly and helped me out from time to time. I was a seasonal worker. My job was to stock shelves and sweep up the place. It wasn't long until I was promoted to cashier. That was the stressful part of my career at Dollar Tree. I'd try and keep up as best as I could and even got praise from my manager. Unfortunately, this job was only temporary, and then I left Dollar Tree to pursue bigger things. I was happy that I got the chance to help people who need my assistance."
good,"Like any public based business you have great days and some not so great.  Amazing staff. Family feel, open door policy. Work with your schedule and allow advancement."
good,"A lot of customers and time flies when cashiering."
good,"I really enjoyed working here, I always knew what to expect, and I was able to jump right into my work. Co-workers were always pleasant, and the managers were pretty laid back and interesting."
good,A typical day at work at the dollar tree facility is fast paced and production based.A lot of hours to pick up hands on with a good opportunity for advancement.Management is hands on and attentive to the needs of the employees but all in all the most enjoyable part of the job is the pay and the constant overtime available.
good,"can be very busy at times, other times the place is very slow and gives time to fix store "
good,"• Meet and greet customers and employees"
good,"everyone gets along, managers are really nice and easy to get along with. they are very understanding with hours and try to work with people's schedules. Good place to increase one's work experience with registers and customer service."
good,"I enjoyed working at dollar tree. I wished that I was paid more, but over all the work environment was very calm. The environment entirely depends on what part of the city you work at."
good,"Allowed for a flexible work schedule, especially as a student I needed time off for finals. Very good first job/part time job, management was understanding and compassionate."
good,"The environment at the Dollar Tree is friendly and it can be slow-paced until rush hour comes around then it is stressful, but overall, would recommend working there."
good,I enjoyed the interaction of the customers that come in the store whenever they may have a problem about something. Problem solving intense problems at work.
good,"I use my morning time to do any office work that is needed. I then spend my remaining time working on the floor. Cashiering, stocking and helping customers."
good,a typical day at work is busy. and then it was sometime slow. the employees was great to work with. and the manger was awesome to work with. and it was close to my house
good,"Customers still complain even though everything in the store is $1.00. They are kinda like Walmart and never have enough registers open! Most of the employees are really nice and try to help and apologize for the wait in line, while the one older manager roles her eyes at them"
good,I really liked my job. Stayed busy. Help was always available. My only complaint would be the scheduling of sometimes just a couple hrs a day for 5 days when 10 hrs could of been worked in 2 days and gas could of been saved
good,"Although it is a part time position which offers no benefits nor do aspire to any carreer advancement opportunities, it does offer extra income as well as having the added benefit of not conflicting with time schedules required of my other places of employment."
good,"Enjoyable work days spent with friendly work employees. I enjoyed working at this tukwila location because of the convenience of being in an area between work and home which made getting to work on a flexible, full time schedule very accommodating."
good,With all things considered the Dollar Tree is a great option for a starting job for new hires. The Dollar Tree are flexible with your hours and are willing to work with you on your schedule while the employees are easy to get along with (in my experience).
good,The time I spent working at Dollar Tree was Great. consisted on stocking or working as a cashier and sometimes would be unloading the merchandise from the truck. we would take turns or required places to stock them or be on the cash register if needed.
good,Dollar tree was great to work at and i enjoyed my time there it wasnt fast pace as i expected but it taught me how to slow down and take my time with restocking shelves and taking customers.
good,"Typical day was the opening & closing. Customer service was favorite part, getting to meet people of all culture and interesting to learn of their view of American culture."
good,Everything is cool until peak season. Peak season will have you leaving at 4:30 and you still start at 5am. It’s not hard work it’s just a 30 min drive at 4 I’m the morning...
good,Management knowledge and problem solving skills are a must.  Department managers control the daily activities of 24 associates to ensure building goals are achieved.
good,I am going on my 3rd year there and its a good job. I cashier and stock shelves. I work freight trucks when needed.I help with freezer truck as well. advancing is the hardest part
good,"I enjoy meeting new customers and helping them out anyway I can, working at dollar tree provides that for me. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with customers and helping them out, a typical day at work is usually filled with an influx of customers from the time the store opens to when it closes."

good,"I would clock in, talk to the other managers and see how the day has been"
good,"I loveda my job at dollar tree  , my days were never boring always busy and the customers always pleased and friendly. My downside experience was I became pg w a molar pg and had to go into surgery and my manager was not understanding or  ethinical due to my emergency situations and fired me. This is really the only job I had ever liked , so I am hopeful as I seek employment again and may  Return."
good,This job helped me while I was in school with the flexible hours and understanding of my schooling. It actually taught me how to mange time and to work hard.
good,"Overall Dollar Tree was a nice job to work at. Even though it was stressful and quickpased when it got busy, i still enjoyed working there. Although, I wish the pay was a little more then minimum wage. I was a cashier and also stocked."
good,"Non-Air conditioned facility. Outstanding General Manager, helpful HR Dept. Managers could use people skill improvements. Non- complicated work responsibilities and unpressured work environment. Managers are either inexperienced or tenured with attitudes. Estimated 4 out of 12 managers have experience and or people skills to be successful. Summer time working conditions extremely hot and winter time cold. The General Manager is exceptional as a leader but management and upper management lacking mainly in people skills."
good,Great place to work and shop. Always new and exciting products arriving each week. Working here is a good team of motivated individuals. Team atmosphere.
good,"Opening duties including: Facing product, Janitorial duty such as cleaning bathrooms and vacuuming. Assisting customers on the sales floor as well as at the cash register."
good,"Great schedule flexibility all around good company to work for, no real complaints.  Just wished they had more hours available for part time employees and maybe some kind of employee discount to make up for lack of health benefits or sick days."
good,"Dollar tree started off real nice, however the district kept switching out managers. I learned from that job, a lot of times people complain about the managers when in reality most managers are just following instructions from above. The job taught me to stay focus and keep my eye on the prize and to never settle for anything less than what I want."
good,"Need to pay more but it's a good job.its a good store to work for good manerger, people,and good time and hours but not enough pay and I love working there."
good,"I would take deliveries, catalog them and put the items either on the floor or in the back in storage. I would also fix up products if they weren't in their place"
good,hustle is the name of the game .  stoke as fast as you can as people stop to talk and ask questions all day .. no rim or reason on how things are placed.
good,"at dollar tree I usually stock on my shifts while tending to customers and associates. management is kind of hard because you have to stretch yourself super thin to cover all the bases and perform your job duties efficiently, that would be the hardest part of the job."
good,I have a plan every time I leave my home and that is come with a plan for the day and you will succeed. I love working I am one of those workers who gets screamed at everyday for forgetting her breaks because of her devotion towards her work.
good,Dollar tree would not be a job for someone trying to make a living only because you don’t get many hours working there. It’s a nice and easy job to have.
good,A typical day at work depends on your stores a truck delivery day. The most difficult day would be when you have to unload 1500 cartons of freight and set your sale and by end of business day.  The most enjoyable part of the job was training my employees so that they could be promoted.
good,Dollar tree is a equal opportunity job. The learning process is fast pace. The benefits and teamwork is great. I like the fact that we can obtain bonuses based in production daily. I'd work there again in a heart beat
good,"The job was only seasonal, I liked it enough to try and stay on as a staff member but they did not need all the people that they hired for seasonal. I enjoyed working with all the other employees there."
good,"it was a very fast paced job always had something to do. I had lots of hours. Had a lot of familys coming in and you could relate with their needs and help them, they gave you tips to living and you gave them tips and recipes."
good,I Learn how to work the cashier and stocking. I got to know so much even though it was my first job I enjoyed making customer happy..my exp was amazing.
good,"You go in the morning with numerous task to perform, so you list out your task for the day and priorities per the importance. Its a fast paced environment with less employees to perform duties."
good,"I am not the average worker.  I go in and walk around the whole store to see what needs to be done. Then, I clock in and get my till and go to work on the things that I see that needs to be fixed. It is a great place to work. I LOVE MY JOB!"
good,It was hard work and didn't pay as much as they should have. There were some communication issues and management issues but was good work. If the pay was more would have a better rating.
good,"positive management and staff, nice working conditions; standing for long periods of time;  availability of additional shifts at other stores. fun enviroment"
good,It would have been a very good job but there just didn't seem to be enough hours or enough pay to keep me there. The time I was there it just seemed I wasn't making any progress besides being moved from stocker to cashier.
good,management and co workers work with your schedule. polite and there is always something to do. you get trained enough to know yourself what to do. i would refer people to work at dollar tree
good,Love working for Dollar tree. Fun laid back place to work. Management is good but the pay not so much. Allows you to do different things not just one thing all shift. But I think they should pay More.
good,My experience at Dollar Tree has been phenomenal. It wasn't my intent to work there so long but the hours were great while I attended college. The staff there is great and they treat you with respect. The customers that come there give me compliments on the store all the time on how well organized the store is and how nice and friendly my staff is. The pay is decent for the work I do there and I feel that Dollar Tree is great company to work for.
good,I loved being a cashier in a fun fast atmosphere cause It made an 8 hour day seem like a 4 hour day seeing that I was always busy. I loved doing drop offs at the Bank for the company and knowing that the company entrusted me with the deposits and counting the money at the end of the night for closing and opening the store
good,Shift passes quickly. I like helping customer's find what they want and show them new items! Stocking is exciting and it is always fun to see new product.
good,"I had a lot of fun working here, miss it at times. My customers are deeply missed. To have had the opportunity to work here and be assistant manager was a great experience. I would recommend dollar tree to anyone looking for employment, they give you a chance especially for first time young job seekers."
good,Dollar tree offered me a productive experience with amazing managers and co-workers that welcomed me from the start with a very productive atmosphere.
good,"I liked working here, they had good policies and the work never felt like it was too much, unfortunately the pay was not competitive enough for my area"
good,"it was nothing hard, just stocking when the truck came was somewhat stressful. Having to put all that merchandise away and knowing you have a little bit of time left."
good,Part-time Assistant Manager Role. Dollar Tree I Worked For Matched my skills and my background of customer service management worked along a great team.
good,"I worked at Dollar Tree while I was attending College and working on Bachelor Degree. This job is a great opportunity for students and other people who desire fun, interactive and rewarding part-time employment."
good,"Unloading trucks, stocking, cleaning, creating displays for feature items, running register and assisting customers was a normal day for me. I enjoyed working there!  I have to say it has changed for the worse since I was employed there."
good,I am very sad that I had to leave my job.I did have to leave for personal reasons though.  and I had to relocated and I did feel that minimum wage is very hard to maintain a normal lifestyle.
good,they are a team. work well with others. ad help each other in any need. give us the opportunity to see what we are dealing with.. give us work to do hen we dont have any work.
good,"My manager treated me and my co-workers horribly, We were constantly being talked down to, being treated less than. Many co-workers refuse shifts because they are scared of our manager. She doesn't listen to request off and gets mad at us for reminding her we couldn't work."
good,A typical work day at Dollar Tree is very fast paced. I have learned the ins and outs of the business I have been with the company for 18 years. The hardest part of my job is that I have very little free time to do things out side of the job.Managers work whatever it takes to get the job done. The most enjoyable part of my job is my customers I know most of them by their first names.
good,This position helps you to learn the basics in retail. You are continuously taught new skills and you have the ability to advance if you really want to climb the retail ladder.
good,"I had done so much for this company ut they never appreciated it so the guy they hired I had to train. I loved my dm she was great but she couldn't stand up for any of the managers."
good,I enjoyed working at Dollar Tree my manger was very flexible with me as I started college. I learned how to speak to people and that being kind to people takes you along way. It was very busy sometimes but we all worked as a team.
good,Making sure all the schematics were set right and properly faced. Loved enjoyed working with other Store managers and receiving different ideas about Sales and doing holiday items for display.
good,"I take pride in my work, everything has a place for it, great under pressure and learn fast. I don't mind training or helping new employs. I do like early morning and love the public."
good,Need to increase pay. Too keep employees. Give discounts too employees. More hours for employees to get the freight out. Stop sending items that don’t sell. Closed the store early for holidays.
good,"Overall , the experience was great! I enjoyed working with those that actually appreciated my work and accepted me for who i am. I would definitely recommend this job to those who enjoy working with others."
good,"It was a good experience to work there at dollar tree and i learned alot, how to become better and better everyday so, ill say it was a good job for me"
good,"I enjoyed my time at Dollar Tree for the most part. I enjoyed identifying tasks for employees to complete, ordering inventory, creating schedule, and working with shoppers."
good,all i did was stay by the cash register all day sometimes clean up most of the time stock shelves but there were only two cashiers working a day and sometime just me and the manager she does a good job though. the culture of the work place is neat and organized. the hardest part of the job is nothing really but stocking and the most enjoyable part is break time sometime we have pizza but the time period of the breaks are too shrt for me 10 mins isnt really enough.
good,Nice place to work and friendly environment good place to work for a 1st time job. A wonderful place to grow in your career the employers are friendly.
good,very fast paced environment. no downtime. stressful at times but keeps you busy. good work environment. advance quickly if you can handle it. no overtime
good,My manager made my job very enjoyable. There is always less stress when your manager is friendly and reasonable to work with. We bonded and are still friends even after employment ended! I love her!
good,Worked at dollar tree for 5-6 years staring as a cashier and eventually to freight manager. If I didn't need to move I probably would still be there. My store was a great place to work. It was like family.
good,"I am a college currently a college student. Dollar tree will work with your schedule which is a positive, The pay was OK. Overall I had a positive experience."
good,"A typical day is very busy going in between taking care of any assistance my cashiers or customers may need while I help to stock and maintain a clean store. I have learned a great deal about customer service, how to handle money and stock a sales floor efficiently. I enjoyed the management team at my store for their friendliness and hard working skills. I would definitely say that the hardest part of this job is also the most enjoyable, and that would be the clientele. Any day I can have someone very upset about something and not be the kindest with their words, but I have also had the kindest and most enjoyable conversations with customers too. You can't please everyone but I do enjoy the help and service I can give to as many people as possible."
good,Good atmosphere to work in. The other staff are very nice and helpful when needed. I enjoy working here but I would like a change of environment where I can grow more with the company.
good,It isn't that bad just none of the managers get along with other ones from different shifts. They also work A LOT of over-time about 86 hours every two weeks.
good,"A good job just so you can get your foot in the door."
good,"My shifts were only 4 or 4 and a half hours long. Some days it was really slow and I spent my down time replenishing the cash wrap, blowing up balloons for the caral, and cleaning around my work station. When I cashiered, I worked fast but I was also careful. I counted my change correctly, I always made sure that i didnt miss any objects and i bagged everything correctly. I learned to count change correctly, and I learned how to balance the tills and prepare a deposit for the bank at the end of the day. The employees and the management was very nice, helpful, and they were always prepared to help. The hardest part of the job was just when it was busy and being the only cashier at times. Other than that, there were no hard parts. "
good,Dollar tree is for high school students i think students would like working there because i did cause i never had no after school activity to do at school
good,"This was an enjoyable job. Days were rarely stressful. Minimum wage was the only downside, along with not enough hours to go around. I would recommend it. The store had a good atmosphere, and i believed that everyone i worked with enjoyed coming into work."
good,"Its on Pulaski road,Fact. Also nice view of street on the outside, and customer should always feel safe because the police station is right across the street."
good,its a very nice place to work time goes by fast when working there customers keep you busy and coworkers are very nice to work with. just the very little hours are not nice.
good,people are amazing they are creative and fun! and they can fun awesome people to meet and  think that are amazing in the career.the culture amazing and people learn lots of skills.
good,Pretty fast paced if you stay busy doing something and not standing around behind the register. A lot of the people that come in are regulars so you build a friendship with a lot of new and cool people.
good,"The managers do their best to make sure all legal policies are enforced. They have years of experience already. Due to their mix of different management styles, they've kept, in general, quality employees. Together, they form a management team of: fun, hard work, comprehension, and discipline."
good,Dollar tree is a very easy going work place not really a hectic job although through out the holidays it gets very busy and a little out of the ordinary but nothing one can't handle. Although it does depend on the location that you choose to work in.
good,Ensure all promotional signage is displayed correctly and current. Task cashiers with additional objectives. Make sure the store is fully stocked as well as clean.
good,"paperwork and stock, I learned how difference with everything a dollar or less , management was okay , hardest thing was keeping the store neat and organized , the best thing was knowing at the end of the day you did your best"
good,I can say that my work experience at Dollar Tree was a enjoyable one. my manager was amazing and I found the work to be just fine. nothing is too hard.
good,"I'm grateful that over the 10+ years I've worked off-and-on for Dollar Tree, the management has always been full of incredibly kind and caring people who go above and beyond the call of duty. It's a hard and low-paying job, so the positive environment really makes the difference."
good,"Dollar tree has an amazing ideal. Has a great product line and the company has some of the most amazing people working for them.  They truly focus on offering great products and a single price point and strive to offer a fun and full shopping environment.  With the rise of min wage, and other over head costs the challenges to make that always happen can sometimes be stressful.  "
good,"I enjoyed my time at Dollar Tree. The managers were friendly and helpful, as were other employees. As a cashier, I would usually up front by myself checking customers out or opening boxes and putting the stock on the shelves."
good,They tell you here its easy to make bonus money. The truth is its not easy at all the job can get frustrating at times but you just have to show the work load who's boss 😉
good,I had a very good experience while working at dollar tree. i enjoyed my work very much. The management was very helpful and cooperative. only negative thing is that i have a short breaks.
good,"Fast-paced environment. Is friendly, fun and customer oriented. Always busy, every worker stocks, cleans and handles customer care. Great office setup, and advancement opportunities."
good,"the most enjoyable day of work i"
good,"Merchandise in store  is unorganized and put in wrong places which leaves good stock in backroom,bathroom is always dirty,floors need repaired and dumpsters with trash need to be picked up more"
good,"This was a ok job very busy only problem not payed enough for the work that you have to do, its a very fast paced environment an you have to be on top of your toes"
good,I enjoyed working at this company but it should have been better pay management should have treated employees right and overall it was a fun environment
good,"I learned a lot from working at Dollar Tree. I loved the management because they were so sweet and understanding, also gave me great hours. I enjoyed closing the store at night."
good,"Working for Dollar Tree has been a fun, fast paced, challenging and competitive experience. Dollar tree offers great benefits with plenty room for advancement."
good,Very good work environment with good customers and employees flexible shifts if needed as well as overtime work and pay management is pretty good and lay back
good,Dollar tree was really laid back as long as you did your job and take care of customers. When you are not on the register you straigten up the front of the store in a perimeter of still being able to see your register.
good,"If you like fun environments. And your just finding your first job, dollar tree is the way to go. It might start you off low pay but hey its a great way to climb that ladder."
good,"Very fast paced which I loved, the employees were drama free and friendly. Customers were great for the most part. My manager was a very energetic team leader."
good,"I loved working at dollar tree, although it was only part time I loved the customers and I also loved working with my coworkers and managers they were great! The time would go by super quick and we could usually get more hours if we wanted to!"
good,"Its a good job for part time workers, had really good managers and I enjoy my shifts. I enjoyed the small conversations with employees and felt I was in a calm and easy going environment."
good,"Working at Dollar Tree has been my favorite job so far. The customers for each store are usually pretty regular so you get to know people and it's a lot of fun.The challenge of working during the holiday season is definitely something I enjoyed and overall the employees were friendly and helpful with one another. The management was stellar, if anyone had an issue it was immediately taken care of and if an employee had personal issues the proper measures were taken to be sure that said employee would be comfortable in the workplace."
good,"I enjoy Dollar Tree, I have been here for a long time. I am just branching out to see what else is “out there”. It’s always been a fun place to work. My new boss is amazing and a big improvement from the last one."
good,"As an assistant manager I was responsible for running the store when the store manager was busy or not there.  I counted the safe, made change for the cashiers, did deposits, audits, bank runs.  I helped unload the weekly truck and put out freight. My manager is an extremely hard worker, but ends up"
good,"It’s ok, just a temp job until finding something better. Atmosphere is nice very they fire people every other day and the management well some managers are cool."
good,Dollar tree was only busy on Sundays or around holidays for balloons and such. I believe that dollar tree is a great job for young adults and also elderly. because of the slow pace.
good,"It's a simple job,good place to train new management.Always ahead with your holidays, school supplies, and gift wrap . Great atmosphere , team work environment."
good,"I got learn new thing how to handle a cash register."
good,Extremely fast paced company. I ran one of the larger stores in the company. Most days there were only 2 employees in the store. I was basically the back up cashier. The better you operated your store the less hours your received. They would take the hours you earn in your store and give them to someone else that was struggling.
good,"Dollar tree is a good place to work. Fast paced, competitive, warehouse environment. Have to be willing to work hard and mandatory overtime during peak season."
good,"working in a truck by yourself for 8 to 10 hours a day can be very long. But, when you have music and an consistent flow of boxes running, the days goes by faster."
good,I would like work there again if I can but I won't because I live in garden City KS now and because my manager at that time lie on the paper work about me calling or showing up so he lied to the CEO corporate office
good,i learned management skill. i handle the cashiers draws counted the safe.i did overnight stock work unload trucks. i managed the front end and i was a cashier
good,"fun atmosphere and full of change. great people, but a lot of time constraints; more opportunities for better pay would make this place the best place ever to work"
good,"A typical day at dollar tree would consist of punching in and counting the daily deposit, where afterwards we would drive to the bank to  drop off said money. After we return to the store I would count my till, set my till and work station up, and start front facing old stock and re-stocking new product while bringing people through on the till. I learned how to multitask very well as well as how to be patient with many of the customers being first generation Syrian immigrants. The hardest part of the job was climbing in the recycling to flatten out the boxes for more room. The most enjoyable part was getting to talk all of the customers."
good,"It was decent, just needed something while i was in school. Didn't much like it there. There were many rude customers, the manager would not help with the long line on busy days."
good,"Great co-workers, great customers.  Keeps your busy, time passes by quickly. Can get tiring and stressful when it gets busy, but that is what makes the job fun!"
good,"Think of a Day at walmart work but much much smaller. From 9-11 isles of easy work. Cashier stands are a little old fashion but it works from them. It's a Dollar store remember. M/W pay with minimal chance of Promotions. Yes you can get promoted but it will take a while and the other guy has to quit."
good,I would love to work at Dollar tree again it's a very good place to meet people and wonderful atmosphere.The management was great and never had a problem with anyone or anything.
good,"I worked there Part time & that's all u can work. If you wanted to work Full Time, you had to be apart of Management. Pay was low too Fun place 2 work"
good,Dollar tree was a great company for individuals to grow as a career path.I have become a better person with some of my upper management through out the years. I have learned how to take on many tasks and run a store with minimum resources.  It had grown drastically in my 13 years employed there and it was difficult to catch up with the demand. I will hope in the future the company will put in more time to training and making the employees the best they can be.
good,Dollar Tree is a decent place to work if you don't mind sweating. They want you to throw 5000 boxes a night as an order picker on a 10 hr shift. They do have bonus pay for 3rd shift and holidays though.
good,"Productive work environment "
good,"dollar tree is a good place to work at, for high school students. in this work place, you were able to have your schedule adjusted to your schooling, and you weren't forced to work long hours since your main focus was on school."
good,"Working at Dollar Tree was a unique experience. You learn many skills that surprisingly can help you in your day to day life. Being able to help a costumer, either to find an item or even discuss the many different projects their able to do with such item/s was the best part of my time there."
good,Friendly atmosphere great learning in merchandising very good teamwork fast pace very professional enjoy making a good impression for customers to enjoy their shopping experience
good,"Come into the store 15 minutes before your scheduled to clock in, go to the back of the store to go into the office to clock in for your shift. Get an idea of what your shift will be like by noticing the flow of the store while waiting on your shift to actually start. Take your designated place to start work while replacing someone else that has ended their shift. Work your allotted hours until your shift is over. Check to make sure all your money in the cash register corresponds with your total for the day, and completely close up your register, and your register's computer system. Return to the back of the store to clock yourself out, record your hours, and clock yourself out. Proceed to the front of the store to leave out and make your travels to your home."
good,My day at work would be making sure that everything is in place for the store to run smoothly and paperwork is done. It can be stressful at times but I always liked a challenge I learned how to manage that particular kind of retail as well as become a store opener and that is hard but fun and you have to be motivated..
good,"Never a dull moment! Between customers and co-worker your always busy. And if you're not, you're not doing your job! That's just my opinion. The managers are awesome and encouraging. If you ever need help with something there's always someone there. I enjoyed my time with the company!"
good,"The typical day is what you would expect, unload boxes or help customers. What sets this place above the rest is the management and the work culture. The particular dollar tree I had the privilege of working at was full of great managers and friendly people. There was no workplace drama and the day was expedited by their companionship."
good,it was working in a fast pace all the time...never enough time to finish what you started....and never enough workers ..but if you dont like it slow than this is the plcae tp work
good,Dollar Tree is a good place to learn how to work with people of all ages! Learn customer service and money handling with ease! Only hard part is unloading trucks and cleaning the bathrooms.
good,"The people I work for are nice and understanding as I learn the ropes.  Wish the company valued my time more, I am after all dying (as we all are) and would ultimately prefer not to spend my time on inefficient earning pursuits."
good,"loved meeting  people from the area"
good,Working the Dollar Tree I  was a cashier and a Stocker I also help  customers after fronting I help the manager by going to the bank or  going to other stores to help them bring something they would need any it was very friendly you're the clean environment no drama
good,"Dollar Tree was a good company to work for. I like working for the company all the co-workers were amazing to be around, it has wonderful customers service. And I really enjoy the customer that came to the store."
good,Nice laid back job however the pay could be a little more. I enjoyed how they work with your schedule and appreciate the work we was doing. The hours were very flexible.
good,"Very fast paced and few employees. learned most of their paperwork."
good,My typical work day starts with making sure I know what has to be done by me and the cashier on my shift. Following through with what needs to be done
good,"greeting new people everyday was my favorite part working at the store, assisting them with their needs. The hardest part of the job was during any holidays where where you have to do your best on getting every customers satisfied on their visit to the stores, but also it kept me entertained and kept doing my job. The management was average, they worked well with me."
good,I liked working for Dollar Tree. It was never ending trying to keep the store clean though. Customers would never put things in the correct spot. Everyone whom works there only works 20-25 hours a week. It is a great part time job but it is not enough hours to fully support yourself.
good,"A normal day at work consisted of: cashier work, greeting customers as they entered and left the building, customer service and moving things from the truck into the back and then onto the floor.  While working at Dollar Tree I learned how to really work as a team, making sure that the check out lines were never too long and just making sure to please each and every customer. My manager was wonderful, very compassionate and understanding but knew when to put her foot down and most of all was a wonderful leader.  The hardest part of the job was the communication the location I worked at wasn't the best, for instance; I was never told when which items were going to go on sale but other than that everything was pretty good.  The most enjoyable part about working was getting to know the people I worked with, everyone was shy and guarded for the first few weeks but once I got to know the people I was working with my favorite place to be was at work with my friends."
good,"A typical day at work when I did work for Dollar Tree was clock in would count my drawer to get ready for my shift, then after counting the money from the register I would start putting the go back, back to the shelves they belong to. I would also make sure that the shelves were tidy and clean and there was no spills on the floors as well If had to keep the bathroom and break area cleaned. I would ring up merchandise for a customer as well as ask them how their day was going then finish ringing up the merchandise and let them know to have a great day or night then thank them for shopping at the Dollar Tree."
good,My very first job where I learned what it took to help costumers and how to stock the items in there rightful place. Not many benefits tho and no security at all
good,Overall dollar tree is a great workplace. You learn countless new job skills and there is always room for improvement. You get to interact with customers daily and can help improve the store overall. Wonderful place to work especially for young adults new to the work force.
good,"Didn't let me leave for my lunch break got fried for drinking one of the stores sodas because water fountain didn't work."
good,a typical day at work is very chill as long as you do your work.the managers are very friendly and understanding.Very safe and friendly place to work indeed
good,its a balance job  Its peaceful and u work at your own paces  its a good job to start off at it a good paying job   u learn alot at the job and they train u on equiment
good,At a typical day at work I would always be at the cashier and  I would either restock or clean up depending at the time I worked. I learned a lot by having communication with people and with my managers I got to learn a lot about the job. The management was pretty good and easy the people were always nice. The workplace culture was perfect for me. The hardest part of the job was that sometimes it would get too full that I did not get to do my duties that I had to do. And the most enjoyable part of my job was that I would get to see different people all the time and the job was not boring
good,great place to work nice people supportive staff good team work. This is a nice store management is good especially the store manager there is always room for improvement but overall great
good,Every two to four weeks our seasonal front end to our store would change. Myself and my freight manager were the only two people that throw freight in my store. On average I would receive a 1200 plus size truck and I myself could turn 800+ just on my own plus running my front end.I am very good at merchandising my store since there is no real schematic to the lay out of our store's so you merchandise with like items so there is an eye appealing flow to it.
good,"Fast pace work with four shifts. Opportunity to learn multiple functions in a factory. Can certify you for different types of machine's such as fork lift, p.e , and reach lift"
good,"Usual days here were pretty easy. Stocking shelves, checking customers out, basic cash handling. The most difficult part of the job would probably be those few difficult customers that were just taking a bad day out on you."
good,"Dollar Tree offers fast advancements to those who prove their worth. I received three promotions in less than 2 years! The nice thing about this retail store, as opposed to others, is everything is only $1.00! So, when stocking, you do not have to follow a planned book. As long as the product is in the correct aisle and is in the general area it belongs, you have the freedom to adjust the layouts as needed. The hardest part of the job is probably the weekly trucks. Corporate determines what each store will receive each week. Most weeks, we receive too much product on the trucks and don't have enough space in our back room to store them. Also, they do not give us enough schedule hours each week to have the stockers working on getting the product out. If they gave more hours, or smaller trucks, the job would be great!"
good,It was clean and the staff was niceand they new where things where.i learned new ways of doing clean up and puting thing back on the shelfs i also learned how to use a cash regaster.
good,"As a cashier, your job is quite simple, you ring customers up and you replace go backs throughout the store. I learned how to present good customer service skills to rude customers. My manager was pretty cool overall. The culture was pretty relaxed. The hardest part of the job was replacing go backs because things were constantly being moving around. The most enjoyable part of this job were the facts that the shifts were non stressful."
good,"I have worked for Dollar Tree for 3 years and it has been an great experience. I was a part time cashier, sometimes I would also do stocking. My mangers, they were very nice and they worked around my school breaks until my senior year. Dollar Tree has been my first job, it has pushed me to be a hard worker."
good,"Typical day at work consists of handling cash and debit/credit card payments."
good,the managers are very nice and treat you the way you should be treated they don't make you do anything that's not fair and help out all the time. customers are understanding
good,Overall working at Dollar Tree helped me advance my communication and customer service skills. I was able to complete the duties for my job and hold minimalconversation regarding topics. Management at this company was not the best...There was a lot of miscommunication between the employees and management team members causing various minor problems.
good,"Dollar tree is a great place to work. They just dont give enough hours. They only work you part time. Witch is only 15 to 20 hours a week. If you only need part time, then its a great place to work."
good,Opening the store was always a breeze with a set routine. Learned a lot about management and running a business which is always my dream to do one day.
good,"I learned a lot from those jobs, customer service, teamwork, different ways to communication with your boss, co-worker, and customers. Meet great people, solve problems on the job, planning and organising."
good,"Dollar Tree is a fast paced work environment which builds on leadership and strong teamwork. Come holiday season, it really gives the flexibility to create a strong, free thinking team that works off one another to get things done. For people who enjoy fast paced work environments where they can work under pressure and use their creativity to drive sales, I would highly recommend it."
good,This is a great job to start out. It was a good Experience. Good Hours. Great Work Environment. The Days went by fast. The Store was located in a Great area.
good,The typical worked day I pushed carts and stock shelves. I stayed busy but still had fun I worked about 30hrs a week so I could still focus on school.
good,Great company to work for. I love the company i just wish there was more potential growth in the company. I would love to work in different aspects of the business.
good,"it was a fun place to work. the reason I left was that I move back to Greenville, SC and they didn't have any open for a manger. I go other job but to this day I can go back with out a problem"
good,It all depends what u want in a job. It will be very hard work especially if u have to clean up the store. But u can move up and get  good money if u stick with it.
good,"When working at Dollar Tree you maintain a very busy and productive day, putting away merchandise and seeing to customers needs. Though it can be tough at times you experience a very good work ethic and learn how to manage your time better. Also, management and the company of other co-workers brighten your day a little more."
good,"It is a good place to work. The Management is great, and so is the customers. Especially the ones that you see on a regular basis. The only thing that I do no like is the max hours you receive a day is 5 hours. Only get scheduled 1-3 days a week. Not enough to live on at all."
good,"I loved working here, It was not hard learning what I needed to do. Everyone was very helpful. And the customers are nice and I love shopping there."
good,They hire fun coworkers. The managers are completely easy to work for and are family based. I would recommend anyone who wants a little extra spending cash to work here
good,This was definitely a great job to get management experience it was not a fast-paced job it gave plenty of time to learn how to run the store and meet new ppl
good,"Dollar Tree as a part time job has been almost exactly what I wanted it to be. It's not overwhelming even after working an 8 hour day at my other job. My coworkers and managers are very sincere and positive. The hardest part about my job is being in silence for several hours, because their company doesn't support music inside of their stores. I usually feel pretty happy about being there as soon as I clock in."
good,A typical day at my job is ok. My co-workers make it best even though the customers may be a little rude everyone keeps their composure. I wouldn't say there is a hard part of working at my job .
good,"A typical day included stocking the shelves, unloading the truck and helping customers. I learned how to pace myself and to think outside of the box.  The management was amazingly helpful.  My co-workers  were very friendly and tried to take care of the customer. The hardest part of the job was creating room for merchandise.  The most enjoyable part was the people."
good,"I was in charge of taking care of the restocking the shelves , checking out customers , and reorganizing the shelves. It was very easy but sometimes got a little hectic. Holidays it gets packed with people so you had to pick up the pace a bit. Coworkers  were nice and picked up what had to be done. Management was good, Added extra people to the registers when things got heavy.They gave breaks when you it was your turn. Most enjoyable about this job was meeting alot of folks that come through the door"
good,"The typical day at work does not just include cashing a customer out, other tasks such as doing go backs, cleaning the registers, the front end, blowing up balloons, or even helping one of out managers out with a task. The managers are wonderful people who make the days of the employees better as they are understanding. But sometimes those days will not last because the hardest part of the day is keeping up while you're just one person. With that difficult time at work, it taught time management and on self-management as well."
good,I love working here the staff here is great no problems with anyone . Management is a great he understands every employee and helps them in anyway way he can.
good,This was a good first job to start you out in retail. What could be wrong when everything is dollar. Work place is nice and easy and out going. A good job if you are looking to put your foot in the door of retail.
good,This company provides a valuable service to the communities in which they serve. The freight flow can be a challenge if the store teams are not on all processes. Ideas and opinions are sought out and encouraged. I truly enjoyed the team development aspect and focusing on the internal promotions. There are great opportunities for all associates If you are willing to work for them.
good,While I was working at Dollar Tree I was also in college and pregnant with other children. The store manager was amazing at working around my school schedule and making sure I never overworked myself when I was pregnant. I enjoyed being told by customers that came through the store that the Norfolk store was one of the cleanest and friendliest stores they have been in. I would highly recommend this store for anyone looking to apply!
good,Working at the dollar tree is ok. I can use more hours to help me out... They are people friendly but i feel they pick and choose who to favor.
good,It is retail so you do not sit down ever. If you are active and like to move this is the job for you. If you are a office manager this is not the right job for you. It is a fun place to work. New stuff comes in all the time. If you want to move up from stocker to management very easy. They support you 100% if your a hard worker. Good starting manager job. Fast pace always doing freight. Now moving from a store manager to district manager that is way harder. They seem to look out side the company for them. Pay is low for DM too for what they do.  Don't get me wrong on the DM they are good people but we loose them because of Pay most of the time. But very successful people tend to work 55 hour to 60 hours a week. Bonus program is awesome again they will pay you well if you put in the time. Great company having growing pains but alway there to help you. Good training 5 weeks for store manager  3 weeks for ast manager.  Payroll is tight like most companies but workable.
good,"I learned better customer service skills. The management was great and very easy to work for. Typical day includes cashier duties, customer service, cleaning area, and keep shelves clean and stocked. The co-workers are great."
good,This job was enjoyable. Management was the best i've ever seen. The hardest part was getting out on time but that was also a good thing in the end. Hired great co-workers and i learned a lot about how to stock and manage a retail grocery store.
good,A typical day at work was either long & slow or fast. Customers would ask for help finding a product every so often & I would help them if necessary.
good,"For the amount of work that is to be done the pay is not enough to sustain a living off, even for someone who lives a modest lifestyle."
good,"I started working at Dollar Tree since January 2016, it's the easiest job I have ever worked because it's pretty simple. Working the cash is easier then dealing with customers, but overall if you like to work in a quiet yet easy enviroment this is the place for you. Staff is great especially my boss, assistant manegers are also the best there is no negativity what so ever in that store. Of course sometimes you get the bad customers once in a blue moon, but in general WONDERFUL place to work at!"
good,Typical retail job. Do your job well and when a management position becomes available they'll promote you. You have to straighten up the store when your also on the register.
good,Fun place to work. Managers were cool and easy to get along with. Nice seeing the everyday customers come in and out of the store.
good,"The management wasn't the best, but the atmosphere and co-workers were great. It was a close family. I felt comfortable there."
good,"Work was usually if not most of the time extremely active, with customers constantly coming in. It was often stressing as I was somewhat often trying to check out each customer by myself without a back up cashier on hand but overall it was a good learning experience. Management was pretty good, aside from the occasional  times where they'd be hovering over my shoulder. Co-works were great, pleasant to work with and talk to. Rarely if never had any issues with them. The hardest part of the job for me was when I'd have to try and manage my duties to get them down and the customers at the same time. Due to the constant flow of customers coming in, it'd make it harder for me to complete all tasks I needed to have done before and/or by the end of my shift. The most enjoyable part of the job for me, was really just getting to move around a lot and also talking to customers, making them happy or improving their mood or day by helping them."
good,The atmosphere is very friendly and the mangers and other employees are very friendly. The managers undersand daily life and are willing to help you scedule accordingly so that both you and they are comfortable and in agreement.
good,"A typical day at the Dollar Tree would be interesting. Co-workers were always happy and always seemed to want to be working at the Dollar Tree. We all would be very busy and constantly moving, cleaning, greeting customers, helping customers find what they may be looking for, and always helping each other through out the day to get all jobs done by the closing hours. I really enjoyed working at the Dollar Tree. i think that if it wasn't for me going back to school to further my education so I could get a better pay rate, I would probably still be there today."
good,"I helped stock shelves. Cash register, Fun and friendly place to work."
good,"There's always drama with coworkers and customers. The best thing about this job, was that the store manager was nice, hard worker, and he could work with my school."
good,"Since dollar tree's profit margin is very low, the main concern on the job is to push/sell products. So a normal day would consist of properly opening the store and making sure all registers are stocked and ready for the day, while also making sure all office paper work is completed and accounted for. An through the use of internal programs suck as ""apple seed"" the management is able to come up with a daily plan; suck as what areas need to be focused on the most and what the cashiers need to complete during their shifts. When it comes to closing it is necessary that you recover/face the entire store, put away all go backs and sweep/vacuum. Now I am fairly new to this job but I am still learning and growing within the company. The hardest part of the job would be the constant manual labor, every day you are stocking anywhere from 100-300 boxes. That does not include unloading our weekly shipments. However the fast pace of the job makes time go by quickly. The most enjoyable part of the job is the work environment, for example I like to keep busy on the job and there is always something to do."
good,"its nice for someones first job or maybe a student of some kind.(college,high school,ect)"
good,"The Dollar Tree Distribution Center was a great job, i obtained quite a bit of knowledge and skills from the time i worked there. i earned my certification of driving a pallet jack, and learned how to stack boxes on a pallet. Working in a fast pace environment is very challenging and also a great learning experience. i would say the best part of working at the distribution center was the great people you get to work and learn with and that you have a set goal of how many boxes you pick in an hour, it makes you want to reach further and succeed. the hardest part of the job for me was learning how to stack the boxes to make them fit properly on the pallet, basically as if you were playing tetris."
good,"the dollar tree work environment is abit crazy on the weekends. though dollar does not have an item the costumers want, they go above and beyond to contact other stores and find the correct item costumers want"
good,cashiering customer service i would help people find the product that they needed while greeting and making sure everyone is happy when they leave the store
good,"I really enjoyed working for Dollar Tree my managers and co-workers were great! A typical day at work I would get clocked in get my drawer counted to make sure there was the right amount  of change and cash in the drawer. I would work the register while I was not busy helping customers I would either be stocking the shelves or recovering the isles making them look nice. When I was done with my recovery I would wipe up the registers and clean up the front of the store. At the end of every shift I would count my drawer again and take out the amount that needed to go to the bank. This was a new job for me definitely different than working fast food. I learned how to work the cash register, how to make returns, stock the shelves, recover, and help my manager close up the store sometimes.  The management there were great all very nice and helpful if you had any questions or problems when you were working."
good,Great place if your looking for a part time job. Great for a college student looking for that extra income. Management is flexible  and works well with your schedule . Nice environment
good,I was only employed for seasonal but my job experience was interesting. This was my first job and I enjoyed working there.
good,I would come in on truck days and unload it. Put out the new items for the customers. Open the store and assist people in finding their need.
good,Fun and easy job.  My co-workers and management were helpful and friendly.  The customers were polite and I was glad to assist them.
good,"I highly enjoyed my time with dollar tree, Great work day in and day out. The only drawback is corporate really dictates what is to be done on the store level, yet none have experienced or worked at that level in a long time"
good,"Dollar Tree is an excellent company to work for with decent benefits for management. You can easily move up from a cashier to a store manager if you are hard-working and motivated."
good,Typical Day is ten hours. Loved the management job and those I worked with. The hardest part of the job was only having two people in the store at all times. As a manager I was always the back up cashier no matter what was going on or how many vendors or trucks were at our back door.Most enjoyable part of the job was our customer base.
good,"I loved working here because of the employees. My manager was wonderful and cared about the business and employees. The pay wasnt that great but it was a minimum wage job. What do you expect? Overall, a great experience."
good,Great company with benefits and room for advancement. Offer continuous education in a face paced environment. Built strong business relationships and partnerships.
good,Very productive and hard working team. Customers are easy and nice to get along with and to help find what they are looking for with the right attitude the approach is easy
good,"Fun working environment.  The most stressful part was coming in at a high peak time of the year.  the management team, however is very supportive."
good,Fun place to work. Very dedicated management and staff. Fast paced environment with attention to customer service at the forefront.
good,"fun work place but professinal, supportive management. all about the numbers and how you personally grow an develop. decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of the company. the most enjoyable part of this job was working alongside my colleauges and learning from them,"
good,"I liked working here, it really was a good place to work and they worked with me on being able to be here when my children got home from school."
good,"A typical day at work is decent.  It’s retail, so you do have your fast and slow moments and days. I learned how to cashier and experience different personalities. The management is great, couldn’t ask for anything better. My co-workers are awesome. They are very respectful and are easy to get along with. Well, being a cashier, there is nothing hard about the job, in my opinion. The most enjoyable part of the job is that the store has a very welcoming atmosphere, and that’s always good."
good,"Being the dollar store, many people were in a hurry so the environment was fast paced. Management was friendly and always willing to rearrange schedules to meet needs of employees."
good,Since my time @ dollar tree I have enjoyed being in an environment in which I feel safe and eager to evolve my career with a growing company.
good,"Great environment, with supportive management who will make time investments in your development. Only issue is they offer everything at a PT level, and I need FT - otherwise, good company to work for."
good,"It is very kind  work place . A fast work place but calm environment."
good,"working at dollar tree was a fun experience, I learned how to check customers out and work under the gun in crunch time"
good,I've learned that many people like to get things for the cheaper price so they will go to Dollar Tree...I think some people came just because they wanted to come chat with me.There was really no hard part at the job..It was all easy to me.
good,"Great first job with flexible hours and friendly staff. A typical day is mostly working the cash register, while making sure the sales floor is presentable during downtime. Clientele can be undesirable at times due to store location and image."
good,"I absolutely love working for Dollar Tree. Its a smaller store, so everyone was close, and you could always find a friend. Management is always flexible and understanding with schedules. I never woke up and was upset I had to go to work."
good,"A typical day at work is stocking, unloading the truck, a lot of cash handling and plenty of interacting with our customers. I started as a cashier and was promoted to Assistant Manager in less than a month, I learned to be a team player as well as a leader. My co-workers are very friendly, easy to work with and talk too. The hardest part of my job is finding enough time in my day to get my work load done, as a retail assistant manager we wear many hats. I love working with the public, its an awesome experience meeting so many people with so many different personalities and my co-workers make my days with Dollar Tree all the better."
good,"Great, fun place to learn more about multi unit leadership! Great team of Store Managers to work with, tremendous support from regional team!"
good,My typical day at work at dollar T .Once i come in I check front Display at front window and making sure that visually display.Then I proceed to office and looks number sales from yesterday and se where i can improve in department number.I've learn many procedure that consist my daily task and one of them reading numbers that could help me reach my goal sales. My Management are well train by my self in order to get productive and task being done even im not in store.My co workers well is my associate i give them prassed and well good job when their department did good numbers and stock.Hardest part of my job is getting two store to manage and not enought time for personal needs.The most enjoyable part of my job is getting my bonus every month and having meeting new customer and people.
good,"A typical day at work is usually kind of slow. The store is located in a small town so the only time we are       super busy is during the holidays and weekends. I learned plenty about shipments and how to properly merchandise. My co-workers were great and they still love when I come into the store to visit. The hardest part of my job was trying to get the most amount of product out in a shift but also being a cashier at the same time. The most enjoyable part of my job was again, working with my co-workers."
good,The work day was very busy from beginning to end. There was always something that needed to be done. I was able to gain managerial experience from this company. The co-workers all put in the hard work that was needed to get a task completed.
good,"Loved job. Loved co workers. Didn't like the fact that when you close and go to bank they add time for compensation, however time addition can cause overages on lunch breaks and then they fire you for lunch break policy broken."
good,"I enjoyed my employment at Dollar Tree.  It was only seasonal but I did a variety of things to help provide excellent service during the busy Christmas season."
good,"If you don't mind being Busy and standing all day, then Dollar Tree is the place to be. The Staff is diverse and easy going. Customers are very funny and can make your day evening in the worst of days."
good,"Treated there employees fair and equally. It was a warehouse that I was working at and productivity was the importance. Product had to be picked and loaded onto the trucks. I was in charge of insuring all the RF, computers, laser printers. label printers, network was connected and working."
good,A typical day was good. My co-workers were kind and friendly. I learned to always ask for help when I need it. The management was okay. I often had to ask multiple times for help then one time I was denied help. The hardest part of the job was recovering items no one wanted anymore. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers and brightening their day.
good,"A typical work day would consists of unloading the inventory, stocking shelves in a clean & neat order, And providing great costumer service."
good,"I cashiered, stocked products on the floor, and helped customers find what they are looking for. My co-workers were all really nice and I loved my Store Manager at the time. He was very helpful and trained me very well."
good,"Enjoyed working there. Good part time job. Co-workers learned quickly. Fast paced, but alternating. Some days would have many customers, some wouldn't have any at all. Busiest time of the year is the summer, then Christmas."
good,"I thought this was a good place to work, and I can honestly say that I did not want to go. circumstances made it so I had to, but it was a good place to be."
good,"Typical day at Dollar Tree, customer service, unloading trucks, stocking the shelves, and ringing register. I learned that you can turn any bad situation into a good one. I was part of the management team. My associates were fantastic there. The hardest part of the job was unloading the trucks with a full back room. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers and my associates."
good,"The Manager is solely responsible for his/her work and the work of their crew. everything that each associate does is a reflection of your work ethic. The environment is very positive but fast paced. You always have to be quick on your feet, never knowing what kind of situation you could run into. Being that it is a customer service position, Flexible availability is a must."
good,"Always staying busy, positive work environment, I enjoy hard work so freight was excellent for me. Great job long or short  term."
good,"It was my first work here. We worked on an new dollar store and the only thing we have to do is stack up new products. Place the products on shelves. It was only for 3 days. As a young teenager, i think the hardest part of the job was only to carry a big box. But i also enjoyed doing that."
good,"-Open store"
good,"Working in recovery, I am given a specific task to do and allowed to do it in my own way, which I appreciate a lot, and also allows me to help my co-workers when they need it.  My managers are always friendly and willing to offer advice and answer questions, and my co-workers are all nice people."
good,"Very fast paced, learned a lot about everything. Management was not that great at times. Co-workers were fun to talk to. The hardest part was working very long shift, past 10 hours. The enjoyable part of working was getting my check."

good,I loved working here. They treated people with respect and everyone acted like family.
good,"A great company to work for. Haven't worked in retail since high school so I had to learn patience over again. The hardest part of my job was reaching an item  on the top shelf.

good,"good place to work , you gain experience in cashiering busy place"
good,"Great people to work with. A typical day at work consist of customer service, daily work on the cash registers, stocking, making over- head store announcements every 15 minutes, and daily paperwork. Its good, hard work. Working at a fast pace gave me confidence."
good,Day by day the store is always changing the merchandise around to make the store more customer friendly. The people you work with treat you like family so it makes the job enjoyable. The hardest part of the day is trying to help every customer and keep up with the workload. its hard at first but you adapt to it after a few weeks.
good,"was in charge of training of new managers, front end sales, and closign of the store... with hard work there was a great chance of growth wtih in"
good,I learned how to manage a team. Hardest part of the job was getting out freight while store was operational.
good,I moved up quickly to Customer Service Rep. at Wal-Mart. A moth after I started I was cashier of the month and two moths later I was a Customer Service Rep. Very fast pace and busy job. I love always having something to do.
good,My day at Dollar Tree would start off with clocking in and counting my draw down for my register I would be using for the day/night. I would then proceed to cash out customers until it slows down enough for me to clean the floor. I enjoyed most of my co-workers and I appreciated the managers that did their job. The worst part was when it was really busy and the parents in the store would not watch their children. The best part of the job was I could work fast and get the job done correctly and accurately because I like feeling proud of what I do.
good,Managers are really nice and love to joke around. They will help you out when the best they can when you need it. Hardest part of the job is fixing other people's mistakes.
good,"A very nice work environment. I was a sales associate, organized the aisles and helped customers with any questions they had."
good,"I am an assistant manager(part time). If you want to work retail, work at Dollar Tree first. This will prepare you for pretty much anything in the retail world."
good,i really like the job and really enjoyed working with customers on a daily basis.
good,This place is located in a shopping center so the work environment is upbeat and diverse. You get to meet a variety of different people. This is a fast paced job where quality and good customer service are important. You learn how to multi task and provide customer service in a timely manner. The management and workers make the work setting enjoyable.
good,"No two days are identical.  Always changing, demanding of your attention to detail.  Amazing loyalty to customers"
good,it's a reputable place and a good environment to better understand the needs of customers
good,I loved the team of people I worked with. It was always a joyful environment
good,"Overall, Dollar Tree was a good place to work.  The work was fast-paced but manageable.  The management was knowledgeable and friendly."
good,"Every work day was a blast!"
good,"A typical work day includes customer service, cash handling, and stocking products. I've learned to use my knowledge from my other jobs. The management team is understanding and have great problem solving skills. My coworkers are energetic and fun to work with. The hardest part of my job is telling customers that we don't have a product that their looking for. The most enjoyable part of my job is the customers."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of running the regisiter & making sure that the store stays clean & every customer has been helped. At this job, i learned more about the people in this town & that being nice can hurt & help you at the same time. Management was Very good, The best one out of every job i've ever had. The co-workers were a bit gossipy but overall nice people. The hardest part of the job was getting more hours. The most enjoyable part is the Feeling Of Acceptance their because MGMT & CO-Workers are Down-To-Earth."
good,Was a good way to enhance my customer service skills. the co-workers were good but there needed to be more communication between everyone.
good,"The only problem is the dm he does not no how to talk to people with out insulting everything no matter what u do is never good enough,always short handed ,and the assistant managers do not help stock,or clean up store,therefore it all falls on the store manager,and lord help u if you get sick,the third degree is truly inforced or your job is on the line every day.i loved my job ,i was a  good worker,but i will not recommend dollar tree to noone ,nor will i ever go back to dollar tree i think 6 years of hard work and being let go on drs order is to much for anyone to put up with.dollar tree used to be fun to work at with all these new changes it will never be right.the solutiom to this is look into the dm he does not like women managers period,he always talks down to us,never compliments anyone of us women tries to make are life misseable.im glad i was let go .because my dr said anymore mental abuse and i was heading for nervous breakdown.im better than that. And dollar tree lost a valuable asset.."
good,"I try to have a good day all the time , I am a team player  .I get along with managment and coworkers"
good,I love my job Dollar Tree including the customers. I have learned alot there as well as still present at the store.. I
good,finding what ever it might be for the costumer and being the good with money
good,"It is very fast paced. The co-workers were, for the most part, friendly."
good,"Nice co-workers, got along with them very well for the extent of my 2 week contract."
good,Multitasking is key to this job.  One minute you're a cashier and then have to inflate balloons or run to get an item for that customer.  Stocking the shelves is very important as you can have empty shelves in no time.  The hardest part of the job is finding balance between customer service and job tasks assigned to you.
good,"My typical day at work was the register. I hardly learnd anything new compared to what I am already experienced with. The management were flexible, cool, and smart. My co-workers were nice and helpful. There was nothing hard about my job then. I enjoyed every bit of work."
good,work well with others team player self motivated. fast learner
good,it was a typical day at work.i learned how to work fast without hurtin my self and without breaking merchandise.the management team was awesome.the co-worker were fast and consitant at great work/the hardest part of the job was workin all day and trying to make over time.most injoyable part was the pay check to pay my bills.
good,"Management when I worked there was just amazing. I enjoyed everyday I walked through the doors I enjoyed all the customers. There was never a hard day of work because I love my job because of the people I worked with. Everyday was enjoyable. Never had a bad day even when it was super busy. I learned a lot from my managers for example how to unload a truck, how to mark down items. A typical day was ringing at the register and stocking the shelves along with greeting some of the best customers."
good,"The day consisted of unloading truck, getting the product out. I learned team leadership as I was in charge of other works and helping them out with their task at hand. The management got all they could out of you and was at times not friendly to employees. I enjoyed my co-workers they listened to me and never complained. The hardest part was the responsibility of other workers and knowing that if they didn't do what was needed to get done if fell on me to be held accountable. It was nice to feel a accomplishment at the end of the day knowing that you did your job the best."

good,I verify the safe and relieve my co-worker. I check the customers out and help with any concerns they may have. The manegers overall were polite and helpful people. The hardest part of some days would have to be wen our system goes down at time and having to keep the customers calm. The best part of everyday was satisfying the customers and having them leave with smiles on there faces.
good,"Dollar Tree is an easy place to work at.  My position required that I meet a quota for the amount of boxes that I emptied within a day from the U-boats.  That was all that I had to do for my position.  However, I would stock several aisles in the store, so the items I placed, and sometimes how I placed then, differed most days.  "
good,I enjoyed working here.  The customers were friendly and we had quite a variety of customers.  Just a part time job but would probably still be there if I could have worked more hours.

good,Dollar Tree is a good starter Job for students graduating High school or still at hime with parents. Also feel they could pay a little more than 7.37 hr.
good,Very hard to advance in this company.  District Manager was not a team player. My store manager then was one of the best people they could have. Lack of communication with the uppers in the company.
good,"Friendly environment, and customers were great.  Management cared about the employees along with the customers.  Store was clean and organized. Would recommend this store to a friend."

good,Face paced manual labor. Unload truck by each peice by hand on rollers.and stack Uboats. You must be able to visualize the items you merchandising. There is Not a Set Planogram. Just general areas.

good,Dollar tree is great job for college students looking for an extra buck some of the managers are awesome some are unprofessional but as long as you’re doing your job you should not have issues
good,"I've worked in 2 different locations of Dollar Tree and they were about the same. I met new people/co-workers. The customers were actually nicer than the other location I worked at. I have worked through all holidays.....Christmas, Thanksgiving, Easter, Memorial Day, New Year's Eve/Day. The only holiday I had off was Christmas. We closed early on Christmas Eve, so us employers could go home early."
good,I absolutely loved working there I started in recovery and work my way up to assistant manager the best experience I've ever had . The customers are amazing

good,"Responsible for running a fast, clean and friendly environment. Excellent customer service. Responsible for maintaining employees. A lot of cash handling"
good,after working here for a few weeks the manager asked if i would be interested in an assitant manager postion. I was doubtful it was for me but i applied and got the job. I was told I would get a pay increase. needless to say that did not happen.
good,"Typical day would be slow, and only busy on the Holidays. Which you only worked half days for or not at all. The management there was above the beyond."
good,My experience working at dollar tree great dealing with customers helping them find what they looking for faced paced environment love seeing the customers happy
good,I didn't have a is due with this job other then it's only one person always which was myself fishing  out because I rang pretty fast so the managers would sit and basically do nothing and even when I became a manager I still was doing everything for 8.50 about which is no money for all the days I worked and was barely home
good,"It's a good place to work, they respect schedules and have really nice co-workers. If you had any issues on why couldn't you go that day to work, they always had someone to cover them or they were asked if they wanted to change the day with someone else."
good,Still work for them. Looking for more hours . Need more hours then the amount giving to me. Again look for 40 plus hours a week. At least. Need more hours. Need more hours. Need more hours.
good,"Overall, this was a good job, its easy to move up if you have the motivation to do so. Scheduling can vary, and hours aren't always guaranteed. But the staff is generally friendly, and booking time off is sometimes easy. Upper management doesn't always care, store management is often great, but it honestly depends on the person. If you're friendly, and have patience you'll do great here."
good,hard work  but fun team members are nice and helpful. always something to do. and busy all the time from open to close. largest store i've ever seen or been in
good,I worked on and off for dollar tree for 19 years and though it's changed with the right manager and crew it can be fun and interesting to work there. So many products coming in it's fun to see what comes in next!

As a cashier I had to create a welcoming environment by greeting and informing customers in a warm, polite, and professional manner. All while managing the cash register in the store, and Bagging or wrapping items for customers when necessary. the hardest part of the job was getting there at 5 in the morning to unload 3000 boxes of merchandise very morning. I rarely enjoyed my part in dollar tree but when i did it was always the part when i finished working for the day."
good,I worked as a stocker and helped keep isles clean and stocked. I organized the warehouse and help keep it neat. The manager was understanding of my right hand disability and didn’t give me more work than he knew I can handle. He allowed me to set my own pace which I appreciated.

good,"Dollar Tree was a great place to work! I really enjoyed being there. The co-workers and management were really nice for the most part. The only problem is the hours and pay, they do not offer full-time unless your manager, which means being paid minimum wage for maybe 4- 4 to 5 hour shifts being paid bi-weekly you don't get paid well. Less than 300$ bi-weekly."

Current district is led my a very unprofessional district manager, who does not push his district to follow company guidelines or regulations resulting in poorly ran stores. Which is abundantly apparent if walking into any establishment."
good,I also was not at this company for long because I ended up having a change in career and relocated to another state. Enviroment was exceptionally clean. Management was fantastic and did a wonderful job of hiring productive and efficient employees. Their system and frontline equipment were easy to use.
good,"My history with Dollar Tree is predominantly good.  My only dispute was a lack of hours and compensation for co-workers, who had to make due with very little.  We as a team made the best of it, however, and it was a pleasure most days to work with customers and make them happy.  Despite personal difficulties, my management treated me very well, and they are very qualified to deal with difficult situations daily.  They taught me to maintain a professional attitude in the face of such adversity.  If I were to recommend this job, it would be to someone attempting to start in retail.  My favorite part about this job was helping the customers, especially the elderly looking for a old fashioned ""good deal""."

All of the people I worked with were really hard working and cared so much for the store. Really loved the environment there, no complaints honestly."
good,I really enjoyed this job. But l was not able to lift the heavy boxes anymore and that was one of requirements of my job. I felt that I conldnt throw the freight like I use to. So I got a customer service type of job in an office.

good,"Overall, my experience at Dollar Tree was great, I learned a lot about their company and am experienced in customer service and know how to help others when they need help. I learned how to keep with the whatever task was given to whether it was making sure the front area was organized and cleaned, or stock the front register areas, etc. The management at Dollar Tree was well organized, friendly, and had everything under control whenever it came down to the holidays. The workplace was excellent, every employee and manager, including myself, did the best to have every aisle organized and cleaned up, as well as having items stocked up properly. The hardest part of the job for me would be keeping myself busy, though it would start to slow down during the nights and as a cashier we are not allowed to leave the register because there is only one cashier and management employee. The most enjoyable part of the job for me would be keeping myself busy for example, stocking items in the front area, organizing each register, and holiday times. During holidays, it gets very busy and I am a fast paced worker so it was a bit of a challenge to get the lines down, with back up cashiers of course, and helping people as best as I could but all in all I enjoyed working there and with my co-workers as well."
good,went to work at 9 pm and restock store and put out new stuff for next day. The manager there was great as long as we got stuff done we coul;d take breaks anytime
good,"My normal routine was everyday get to work, clock in, clean and pick up anything that was misplaced, than start to stock ails the were assigned to stock, unload trucks Saturdays and Tuesdays and after everything was finished i had to make sure everything was in place and organized.

good,A typical day at work would be to make sure we are meeting the customers needs and making sure everyone leaves satisfied. I learned how to operate a cash register and communicate better with people. Management is fantastic. I really like all of my managers. The hardest part of the job is recovery. You have to constantly deal with merchandise being out of place. The most enjoyable part of the job is doing cashier. I like interacting with customers and bagging product.

good,Working at Dollar Tree was a very relaxed experience for me. My managers down to co-workers all treated one another with the utmost respect. The hardest part of the job was the time shift that i had(Overnight/Graveyard).

good,"I didn't work here long but the time I did was alright. I was trying something new, some things I liked and some things I didn't. Managemt was great and did their best. Hours were crazy working so early in the morning but worth it for the most part. I had gotten another job while working here and found out having two jobs wasn't my thing. Nothing hard about this job, everything was pretty easy and the most enjoyable was seeing friends and meeting new ones."
good,can i say something this a great place to learn how to mange and up keep the work place another thing was the mangers was also great people to work with
good,Dollar Tree is a good place to work if you are a high school student and need only a part time job. The location is excellent. Just not enough hours worked per every two weeks.
good,"Corporate was the biggest issue, constantly unimpressed with our sales. Management was okay, if a little disorganized. There were barely any hours to be had and it was not worth working there."
good,"Nice job for your first job , typical day customers complain , its only you at the register being the only cashier managers dont come out to help. "
good,Shipping and receiving is the typical day. I learned a lot about receiving. management was very helpful. the work place culture is friendly. the hours are the hardest part of the job. the people are the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,Dollar tree is a great place for teens who are looking for employment but not good for people trying to make a career out of it. It has a great working environment.
good,"Once you get a staff that is willing to see you vision and ideas for your store, and participate in that vision, the job is a good one. Unfortunately, with the rate of pay offered to assistant managers, it's extremely tough to find the right people."
good,"I felt that my work experience was at times stressful, but manageable, Training was good but inconsistent  when under pressure. The trick to the position was to be organized and flexible.  "

good,I loved my time there I had to leave due to the fact that I am a single parent of 3 and at the time minimum wage had not got up. so I wasn't making enough to support my family
good,I would get there in the morning get the area I was working ready and around it cleaned up. As customers come in I would check them out and help them with questions and any other needs that they needed. When I wasn't helping a customer I was keeping myself busy keeping my area clean or putting back the items that needed to go back on the shelves.
good,The company has great benefits and great pay. The organization is growing every day. You get out of the company what you put in. Learn new skills every day.
good,"Ive worked for this company for several years, if you can handle a fast paced retail environment and have a real desire to work this is a place for you.  Our current store manager might work you hard but she works just as hard which the leading by example role is always greatly appreciated."

good,Dollar Tree is a growing company that has many opportunities for people that like change on a regular basis. Management is good and the environment with co workers is great if you like being on a team
good,"Everything about Dollar Tree was pretty simple. The only real questions a customer had to ask were where items were, or when we would be getting them back in stock."
good,"overall good job. People are good to work for. there needs to be more "
good,"I would show up and I would head straight to the back to the warehouse to begin unloading and preparing to go place items in their proper isles to get put onto the shelves."
good,I liked my job just needed better hours. It was a great place to work and the people were very helpful and I would go back if I could work those hours again.

good,Working at the Dollar Tree was one of my best work experiences. Being young and being able to work with so many great motivated people help to create an exceptional work environment.
good,I enjoy the job duties and the team I work with. Its a manageable job that keeps me busy and provides me with valuable skills moving forward in my career.
good,Dollar Tree is a great place to start for a first job. If you really want to advance you better be in management or corporate. I have seen many employees come and go for a variety of reasons. I got the pleasure of  knowing several employees but I feel that I am ready to leave. They are usually good about the shifts that they sign me up for although I have to remind them every so often. The hardest part of the job was when they update the system and don't tell the cashiers which confuses us and we can't serve costumers as well as before. A close second was when I just started and didn't feel adequetely trained. The best part is when other cashiers trade for or cover shifts for you. It does take a while to get to know new managers but they tend to be pleasure to know and work with. Due to how Dollar Tree operates they usually obtain a variety of merchandise that they get only so often and costumers often ask for that we don't have in stock. This is partly because Dollar Tree is a liquidator store.
good,"Hard work and good pay. My Job title was stalking I also did cleaning. Examples I cleaned toilets, sink, Mopped, Swept and wiped down the sink with Cleaning supplies."
good,"Dollar tree was a good experience, the training that was provided was really nice and easy not complicated. Learning the cash was easy, always had good customer service and always worked with a smile and positive attitude"
good,"The company provides a structure which allows all District Managers to be successful. The company has taken the time to test and implement tools that drive sales, productivity, superior morale and reduce turnover. I have found it to be a fun and challenging environment during my time with the company."
good,"The managers and employees are enjoyable to work with. I learned how to stock shelves and unload a truck. You don't work unless you clock in, you don't work for free."
good,Working at dollar tree was smooth and relaxing. You may get bored at times but it's a good job for anyone who's starting out. I got good money handling skills out of it.
good,"Temporary job just built shelves and set new store easy short job. I set new isles stocked shelves, hung merchandise, recycled boxes. organized stock room."
good,I loved working for dollar tree. I enjoyed working overnight stock because it was quiet and i could focus alot better then i would have been able to when the store was open.
good,Dollar tree does not do enough to incentivize its employees to come to work and not steal.  Pay is extremely low and only part time positions are available unless you're management.  This is not a job that you can have and support your life.
good,They were gest company to work for a nice clean respectful environment I liked overall working there the people I worked with where good Co workers I wouldn't change anything
good,"A typical day at Dollar Tree consist of being a cashier and stocking merchandise. The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with the daily customers, and my co-workers."

good,"My day started with opening the cleaning room and collecting supplies for the day . I then would fill my cart with clean sheets and pillow cases, bathroom supply's ,I would strip the beds put clean bedding ,I would dust and wash TV,lamps,table,walls,vacuuming ,bathroom,change towels, clean and pick up garbage ,change garbage, replace soaps ,shampoo, cups"
good,A typical Day was to open up the store. Clock in and get to work including recovering the store and stocking shelves and ringing up customers. Supervising assigning duties to employees and scheduling shifts to meet the store needs. Making deposit drops and closing out the books daily on store operations and profits.
good,This store was a clean and safe environment.  Their interest was always for the customer.  The store was also very family oriented.  It catered to all families and lots of different cultures in the area.  Always had the opportunity to help the customer and provide them with respect.  After all it is because of the customer I had a job.
good,Was an awesome place to work for. Also awesome people to work with. The customers were awesome as well. Stayed busy with the customers as well as with keeping the floor stocked.
good,"A typical day included counting and managing money, as well as stocking items. The workplace allowed me to be challenged with many different things, which has permitted me to learn different ways to handle customers and their needs."
good,Stocking cashiering was my job. learned so much. The management was very fun to talk. I really enjoyed working there. i miss working there. i met different people from different culture which was really good.
good,Very friendly employees  will do whatever they can to make sure and help you for what your looking for and everyone gets along great and has great customer service
good,"It is great working here. My managers are very attentive on my coworkers and I. it is a small store, so majority of the time it is just me and my manager. There are moments when it does get hectic because of the amount of people in line, or wanting balloons, or having people want things all at once. But it is something I have learned to manage. Also, I do have my managers help."
good,good first job to have as it is not hard to learn the duties of workers and learning what things need to be done by the different workers. enjoyed working there.
good,"Honistly my favorite job I have ever had. The staff was amazing, the atmosphere and general vibe was better than any job I have had since I have started working. Ever. Like any job there are holes in the company, like wast and maybe ways or organisation. But the store manager and even districts Managers where willimg to Help you change prosegers. All in all managment has been very helpfull and Has given me a confidence I never had befor working in this  Company. Im sure not all locations are like this but 9/10 would recommend."
good,"it was a quick pace job but easy, management is decent but not the best plus i learned different things at the stock room, the job is preety good for someone starting"
good,"Learning to interact with my customers was great, I loved meeting new people everyday. I liked having different responsibilities each time I would go into work. They definitely give you the opportunity to advance as long as you show your dedication. Fun environment, something new and exciting everyday."
good,I enjoyed working at dollar tree i learned great customer service skills. The work environment  was very postive. I enjoyed working in a fast paced environment
good,"A great company to work for as your first job. Flexible with schedule , easy work environment. You are able to work as cashier, recovery or stocking. Great management as well."
good,They have a some what a flexible schedule. Some of the management easy to talk too. Have to run the coolers and run the general store items too. No one wants to be there for truck days.
good,"As my first job, Dollar Tree taught me the basics and fundamentals of customer service, cash handling, taking inventory, and unloading freight trucks in an orderly and accurate time."
good,I loaded and unloaded U-boat freight carts to be stocked the next day. I worked on a team that worked on unloading a company freight truck. The products were stacked in neat stacks to ensure safety procedures.
good,"Working at Dollar Tree is a good place to learn a lot about the retail space, greeting the customers with a positive attitude and working together with others to take on the task at hand. Dollar Tree provides great hard-work experience and rewards you with great opportunities to advance in your career."
good,Dollar Tree Distribution is a workplace that encourages productivity. The hours are long but can be rewarding when you see your work go to good for the stores.
good,"Customer Service main priority, fun place to work, flexible schedules, and opportunity for promotion. Customers are great I enjoyed my team mates and location."
good,"I would stock shelves, and manage the cash register. My managers were really friendly and worked around my school schedule. Sometimes the customers were a bit difficult."
good,great place to work employees were considerate understanding dependable and the customers were polite and delightful Dollar Tree duties were manageable
good,"I've enjoyed and continue to enjoy working at DTC for the past 3.5 years.  All my coworkers and supervisors have always been very friendly and accommodating around my school hours and other needs.  I have gained a lot of confidence and experience with interacting with the public through this job. The only downside is that there isn't much opportunity for raises, as I've been making minimum wage this entire time."
good,We love our store we keep it clean it's easy to find things we always work as a team we help each other at all times the managers help us good we have change
good,Overall really enjoyed working here. This was a good management training experience for me. Jump started my career in the supply chain field and helped me determine the next step forward.
good,"my duty was at the register and help customers,Always have my work area clean good vision for the customers. The most difficut thing was to attend people with bad mood ,but in the end I knew how to take care of the situation."
good,"Working at D-tree was both a very good and a very bad experience for me. The people I worked with where very hard working, supportive, fun to be around, and generally felt like family. The working environment was generally slow paces until holidays and certain events came around, where things started to speed up a bit. I have absolutely no qualms about the nature of the work (Neatly stocking shelves, unloading merchandise from the truck one a week, handling a cash register, filling up balloons), nor do I have any problems with my co-workers or any of the highly supportive managers that worked there. The problems I do have however lie solely with corporate. The higher-ups at Corporate made it very difficult for the employees to be able to work at a steady rate. In my time working at D-tree, I only received an average of 12 hours a week on a very low pay. On some weeks, there where so little hours for managers to work with that I would only receive six or seven hours. The limited hours and limited pay forced me to consider other positions outside of D-tree. If the pay was decent and the hours much more consistent, I would return in a heartbeat. If you are someone whose looking for experience in a management position, or looking to advance even further and doesn't mind the low pay, then I would recommend working here for the experience. Anything beyond that however, I would recommend seeking out other positions."
good,well i usually have the morning shift so ill get a till count it before customers come in when we open. I normally greet customers as they enter the store. Assist customers when help is needed and keep the front end of the store looking presentable for the customers to feel good about shopping.
good,"Management is always helpful, will provide you with answers and will accommodate as much as possible. Moving up isn't hard as long as they can see you want it. This is the job where I found out what I wanted to do for a career."
good,Not the most thrilling job out there but plenty easy.  The hardest part is putting things away that people leave all over the store. Not exactly difficult.
good,Fun place to work at always meeting people. Place is not to big so you have the chance to know who the regular people are. Flexible work schedule. Not to heavy of a job
good,Everyone like to save money. That is one of the reasons the store is so busy. It is a fast paced environment to work in but the atmosphere is great and there are great people to work with.
good,they try to locate you close to home. hours of work were 40 hours. rotating days off. always getting new product in. there locations are all around western new youk
good,I started as a cashier and moved up to an Assistant position.  I learned a lot about working with a small team and leading people in this position.  There was a great team in place so it made it very enjoyable to be at work.  Management was great and always willing to help.
good,"Boss was amazing, customer were okay. Learned a lot in the 5 years working there. Moved up from a cashier to a operation assistant manager in 1year. Was able to run the whole store with two other cashiers sometimes even one."
good,I was in charge of running the cash register most of the time. some the the other duties i had were stocking the shelves and vacuuming when the night had ended. My most enjoyable part of the day was getting to meet new people.
good,My typical day is assisting customers to make sure they are finding everything that they need and keeping the shelves stocked with merchandise to make items easy to find for them
good,"people were nice, great hours, learned about the town allot. work there was easy, management was great, nice, and dependable. The work environment was  good."
good,I start work by walking the entire DC.  I then meet with managers the discuss the events of the day.  I update incident records and I talk to associates the find out their safety needs.
good,Good place to work. They care about their employees. Managers actually train you and not just throw you on the sales floor. Asking questions are welcomed by staff.

Whether you are a cashier or on stock crew it is all timed, recorded, and you get pushed to do your duties, work with as many as 6 other people depending on how busy store is on a day to day basis. Coworkers are all considered family pretty much, you do everything together from team effort on line or events we have for store. Hardest part of the job is recovering the store in the time given, depending on how busy store was and how many people are working it may not get all the way done.

good,a typical day was me coming in and clocking in then getting a register and starting. i learned how their registers worked and how to stock shelves. management was good and very helpful. my co workers were great and a very big help when i first started. i didnt have a hard part in my job. the most enjoyable part of my job was meeting different type of people throughout my day at work

Maintain a professional and friendly relationship with Manager and Customers, Follow procedure including safety guidelines, Assist with all  store function including; scheduling, store ordering, freight process and all day to day store activities as directed."
good,Even on days that the store was dead I still had something to do whether I helped other coworkers
good,Everyday here seemed to bring new challenges whether it was working with new co workers or dealing with different personalities of customers or even keeping up with new items in stock. I learned how to handle situations involving upset customers. I felt that the management lacked communication especially about schedules. The co workers were enjoyable to work with and was always staying on tasks as well as making it feel like a family. The hardest part of the job was closing down the store which involved sorting broken or missing items off shelves and going through individual aisles and sorting through the bottom bins to find missing or broken things or hanging up what could go back on racks. To me the most enjoyable part of my job was working the register meeting and greeting people and bagging their things and seeing them leave with a smile.
good,may be busy at times and sometimes slow but there's always something to be done. always a store opening up for employees who wish to be a store manager

good,it was kinda boring but a great learning experience. you learn many new skills volunteering at the VA Hospital.
good,Perfect for job seekers just entering the work force. Management seems very keen to help new employees. The co workers of which I've encountered thus far have all been very helpful and willing teach me the basics. The hardest part of the job I must say is standing for the entire shift. I also dislike how the company keeps all workers under Full Time status.
good,"Very hectic and busy store that will keep you on your toes from the time you start to work.  "
good,"Management was willing to work around personal schedules and made this an enjoyable business to work at. Restocking shelves, customer service, sorting merchandise, cleaning. Downside is part time at minimum wage was hard to support my family at the time."
good,i thought it was a nice small place to work. It was my first cashiering job and i think in went pretty well.
good,This job is very laid back. Each person should know what to do and how to do it.
good,"Opportunity for advance if you are a hard-worker"
good,"Typical day at work would always be busy, always running around and taking care of stuff, which I enjoyed because it made time go by faster. Learned a lot of management functions at Dollar Tree. Co-workers were amazing as was my manager. Hardest part of the job would be not always making the sales goal of the day.

good,"Loading and unloading truck's with forklift."
good,Professional employees and satisfied customers made this job very enjoyable and fun.
good,"I came to this company with a few years stocking experience at Kroger. The manager was awesome and a hard worker. He hired me on as a part-time assistant manager/freight manager. He taught me a lot about the company and the job and worked with me side by side for four years until he retired. The next summer the full-time assistant quit and he promoted me to full-time. Being a full-time ASM has it's perks. You get about 35 hours a week and open a lot of the time so you can work out the bulk of the freight. You are enrolled in the company bonus plan (only if you are full-time) and if you store exceeds expected sales you can get an extra $80 - $300 (depending on how well you did and the time of  year) which is really nice. Store Managers get even more in the bonus plan."

good,I work at this job called Dollar Tree. Its a good job though but it has it advantages and disadvantages. What i learned about the job is that they trained on certain things inside the store. The hardest part about the job is when you pick up the heavy boxes and u get sore. my strength is just going to work every day.
good,A typical day has its ups and downs. The customers make the place hard to keep up.
good,"A Typical day was opening up the store, getting daily weekly monthly numbers. Replenishing the store, merchandising and building product displays everyday and seasonal. While giving great customer service and over looking employees. I learned all basics and a lot of advanced techniques of policies and procedures of how to run a retail store. I would say the hardest part of the job was often not having enough hours to run the store with the amount of employees it required. The most enjoyable part of the job was doing something I enjoyed to do, while working with great people and making a difference every single day in peoples lives weather it was just giving great customer service to turning a frown that someone walked in with into a smile by the time they walked out of my door."

It was nice knowing I could help others find an item, or knowing that they found a product because their family was on a budget. Making people smile was the best part of my day."
good,"when working at dollar tree you experience the basics in working. In this field i learned how to work the cash register, and it was easier for me cause the way my manager set it up for me to remember the basics. My co-workers great to work with definitely with the communication we all inherited helped us get threw the job. The hardest part of the job is really nothing because it's simple work that i was assigned to. The most enjoyable part of the job is socializing with my co-workers and being able getting thru the day know i did an excellent job."
good,"typical work day show up run a cashier, stock shelves, clean and put product away in the places it should be in. Co-works are fun to work with, makes the day go by faster.

If the job is printed on 3mil, we allow dry time and then lay the job down on 20 or 40 mil styrene, Foam Board, Coroplast.  Then the job is boxed properly, sent to the mail room for further shipment.  I learned that without the art products will not sell.  My supervisor is very knowledgeable and wise, his experience allows the shop to run smoothly.  My co-workers and I get along well, we help keep each other focused and we compliment each other well.  The hardest part of the job is when customers change things at the last minute.  The enjoyable part of the job is when my supervisor treats us to lunch. "

good,A typical day at work is aon average about 100 customers. My co-workers are very easy to get along with. The most enjoyable moments on this job are the great teamwork and determination to make the store a better working environment.
good,"The position I had kept me busy daily with data entry, reporting, human resources, warehouse staff duties and assisting the general manager. The best part of the job, besides always staying busy, was the fact that I got a chance to meet different people and help different people everyday. Management allowed for me to work independently without being micro-managed, and trusted in my decisions. I made sure to never let them down, and they never let me down.

good,"Overall, I enjoyed my experience at Dollar Tree. The work place was fun, while being structured. The employees had a good relationship with each other and the managers. They gave raises based on performance and promotions when deserved. The management was firm but not unreasonable. The only issue was with orders from upper management on how the store should be organized and often required the shifting of entire aisles over one and then back again. This was the least enjoyable part of the job because it took up a major chunk of time and then was usually moved back within a few weeks. Otherwise, I enjoyed every aspect of this job, although the pay was a bit low. But, if I had stayed with the company longer, it would have likely gone up"

Management was very good and my two years there I went through 3 managers. Hardest part of my job was when nothing we did was correct to our district manager would punish us. The most enjoyable part was my coworkers, who always made me laugh and smile and made work worthwhile. I learned a lot about the retail industry when it comes to ordering product, sales, and customer service."
good,I enjoyed working at dollar tree because of my customers and my employees. My manager got very picky towards the end of my employment with them and since I have gone they have had 2 new managers in my place and only one of my original crew is still there.

good,I love working at dollar tree I have flexible hours and there’s never a boring day.I love working with my crew and customers.A typical day at work would be coming in and cashiering cleaning the front and sweeping the whole store.Making  sure everything is neat and well put before the day ends.
good,I think Dollar Tree is a great work environment for people to work. I also think and believe their pay is outstanding. The management seems to be great and the employees seem ok just as well as the customers
good,I like working here but I had another job so I guess the days that I did work was with my other job so I was supposed be at a different dollar tree but she didn’t let me know the other store was ready
good,"There is never a dull day at my job, between the wonderful customers and my amazing co-workers we make those 5 hours count for more than just scanning product."
good,Some days are better than others but it here not really a hard rome working at dollar tree. A great team makes a great store! We start really early so that we can meet our goals throughout the week

good,"The register is easy to learn, just have to know how to talk to people and bag items. Management is friendly and professional. Employees are very nice."
good,"Opening, Setting Up, Cash register start up, On certain days of the week each week we would get ready for delivery truck, Setting/ organizing over 1,500 boxes once a week, organizing about 300-400 boxes a day, Stocking shelves daily, Hardest part of the job would usually be weekly delivery trucks, most enjoyable every day."
good,This place is really good to work at . i think this place was really fun to work at because everyone there is super nice. we also have very good costumers too that keeps coming back.
good,"I worked as a cashier and as a stock associate at dollar tree. Cashiering was a simple process, as was counting and dropping the till before and after shift. Stocking was a bit more difficult because the merchandise is always changing from the company purchasing whole sale shipment containers with who knows what inside, aside from their permanent brand contracts. The truck hours would change and vary each week but there i always between 1500-2500 items of freight to be unloaded and categorized to specific u-boats per aisle and section. The truck is unloaded by hand unless it is already on a pallet like the frozen food section. After separating freight, we would begin stocking the aisles with it and then break down the boxes for recycling. It can be incredibly and physically taxing, especially when one or two stock associates don't show up for their shift and the truck needs to be unloaded either way within 2 hours maximum. The store manager was a great guy so I will certainly give credit where its due."
good,Good for while I was finishing high school and starting in university. Gave me good options and overall was very happy there. I plan on returning if I need another job.
good,"Great company, just looking at what else is out there. Dollar tree has been flexible and worked with me on my needs. They do train and listen to their managers opinions."
good,"Stocking goes by fast, work hours are flexible. Must be able to lift up to 50 pounds at times. You are expected to stock at least 20 boxes an hour on average."
good,everything is going pretty well and everyone gets along. im not afraid to ask questions or for help at all. the manager is willing to help me improve on my work ethic and assist in teaching me how to improve on my stocking skills.
good,I stock items that are unloaded from the truck and I help people find items that they looking for and I fill up the stack section with chips and drinks
good,I like my job just need better pay. This is a job where I get to meet new people. And also I can help other employees better at what they do. Easy to apply but not a lot of hours.
good,"Dollar Tree in Marshall, Minnesota is one of the best retail stores I have ever worked in. I has merchandise for everyone of every culture and has very friendly help. The working environment is healthy and non-stressful, the managers are amazing, and the customers are always so polite. I would recommend this store to everyone I know."
good,It's not to bad we miss the boss use to be there and she was friend and understand what we go through if we need to talk it is place of work but it's nice not have hostile environment we do with new boss
good,There is days you will love with and days you want to pull you're hair out. And there are days that you will only work 3 days out of the week. And days you will work 6 out 7 days .
good,It was a fun place to work and I got along great with my co-workers. The only thing I didn't like was the fact that I was working there while I was pregnant and I was having pregnancy complications and I had just had a miscarriage three months prior and the manager fired me because I couldn't come to work due to having pregnancy complications.
good,"The workload was difficult to complete under a certain amount of time, and there was never much hope for a decent wage. The people there made it worth it and made you feel like a part of a family."
good,It was a good good job.i liked the wotk and the hours there.my coworkers were good nice people. The hardest part of the job was the restocking. The best part was the customers.
good,Wish I still was there awesome company with an awesome manager the people who work there are very kind and friendly and I really liked all the cool stuff that we sold there .
good,"I stock in the mornings and its very convenient, the store is comparatively small. The co-workers are kind but all speak Spanish predominantly. The managers are worlds apart, some are very kind and benevolent and some are more quiet and reserved."
good,A relaxed and cool place to work. Got along great with team members. Great benefits and a great career opportunity. Really enjoyed working for that company.
good,Dollar tree was a great place to work at and excellent manager experience. All of the employee’s were very respectful and obeyed store policies and proceedures. The company has great benifits and stock purchase plans.
good,"* Work was quick-passed and very productive "
good,Dollar tree gave me my first taste of civilian work after my time in the service. My manager was a great motivator and leader. She would mentor every assistant manager so we all have all the tools we needed to succeed.
good,I enjoyed working there. I started as a cashier and was promoted to Assistant Manager in a short time. If you work hard and are honest you can have a career at Dollar Tree. Very good place to work
good,"Just like any other retail store you have your pros and cons "
good,"I had fun with the co workers "
good,Productivity was the name of the game. Helping customers was an extremely enjoyable part of the position. Many characters come through the storefront.
good,Every employee was always trying to help me better myself when it came to learning where things went around the store. The managers were always making sure the store was clean and neat at all times. Every employee will make sure every customer left the store satisfied.
good,"Working and being a team member of Dollar Tree, Incl. is what you make of it.  For example, I am currently, retired from the business world for over 30+ years of experience in the Administrative/Clerical/Accounting employment. I personally, enjoy working part time which a semi-retired person as myself can actually, accommodate my personal with working needs.  I enjoy working with people which is what I did for the past 30+ years.  In this light, I basically assist people in a consumer way rather than a professional arena."
good,A typical day requires organization of workplace and communication with customers. I learned to work fast paced and get tasks done. The management was nice and understanding. The hardest part of the job was not having a set schedule. The most enjoyable part was working with nice coworkers.
good,The job was fun but I found issues with the distribution of work. My co-workers had often expressed the same to me. I feel as though only having two employees running the store per shift caused multiple problems in that area.
good,"it is a very laid back easy job, if you are experienced. the management is nice and works with you on sceduling. i have not had to deal with discipline so i am not familiar with some repercussions, if you go to work and be productive, it is a great job."
good,"Must enjoy working with others and able to handle different opinions. The work is not hard. Really nice and laid back place to work. You get to meet alot of people. The benefits, if you get on full time, are good."
good,It's a busy work place and sometimes it slow but everybody works together to make sure everything done right and halfway. The manager is a hard working woman we help with everything like working the receivers at the back so we can have room for the truck and other items that can't go on the sale floor.
good,Dollar Tree is a very high production place to work. I gained a lot of stocking and production and module setting skills form this company.It was a very high demand setting and I had very driven and motivating managers. The hardest part of the job was unloading the truck and the part I enjoyed the most was putting up the freight in a timely competitive manor.
good,"Keep a smile "
good,The company spent a lot of time in training the managers.   They focused on developing the managers to be successful in a high paced work environment.  The mentorship program was very good.
good,Dollar tree was a great experience will fast paced I love the job I would go back if I could.Managers were nice to me they also offered me an assistant manager job there
good,"There was excellent customer service, organization of products, and treatment of staff. I highly recommend to anyone to have the opportunity to work there."
good,Dollar tree would be a much better place to work if drama and hime lives were kept separate and managers actually trained their employees as they are suppose to. Managers should not favor one employee over another.
good,"you do not make much but its great for a first job or for part time. Its fairly easy work and most people are friendly, depending on where you are to be honest."
good,Not too bad to work for. Commute was a little bit too far. Keeping good people can be difficult. The training program is excellent. Benefits are great.
good,The Dollar Tree was a solid job that gave me a good amount of hours. they were flexible with my school schedule and also gave me a good amount of hours that I requested.
good,"I have a few other responsibilities at the Dollar Tree, such as stocking small items near cash area and reading glasses, sunglasses, etc. I also try to straighten the aisles and stay busy the entire time I am scheduled to work."
good,"Working at dollar tree wasnt the best work place ,niether was it the worst. Putting in alot of hours and over time seemed like it didnt add up to the money I was recieving in a check."
good,I didn’t really have any work hours so I’m not making a lot of money. I’m just to to work and find something that works with my college  schedule when school starts back up
good,"Dollar Tree may not be the best paying job I've had, but my employment has been very full-filling. Teamwork makes the store and employees thrive, but we don't forget about making everyone feel welcomed and have a little fun. We do our best to make all our conversations with our customers and employees personal to show we care."
good,"Morning and evening shifts are relaxed, but get competitive. Coworkers make it an incredible work experience. When packing out stock onto the shelves, it was a competition to get the most product out on the shelves."
good,Cashier stock shelves. Management was great I lied working there. I would work there again. The manager was fun and outgoing to work for. If I didn't relocate I would be stl working there.
good,"nice place to work if you love helping others and meeting new people everyday. great coworkers, fast place job on most day. great items for $1 Part time hours only."
good,"Dollar Tree is a face pace job and very simple. I enjoyed stocking and taking care of customers. It wasnt a hard job at all, it was kind of hard to get to work at the exact time i had to work because of the bus schedule and having someone watch my child."

good,"I enjoyed working for Dollar Tree very much."
good,"I liked the work environment. Ideal for obtaining Customer Service skills. Mostly relaxed, slow-paced. Occasionally fast paced. Great staff. Work requirements easily manageable."
good,"Hi level, fast moving daily work. constantly learning and providing feedback both to upper and lower directs. Constant interactions with both external and internal customers in order to provide the best customer experience possible,"
good,A typical day at work consistents of me cleaning the store and assisting employees and customers with questions and job duties. I also have to monitor the safe and ensure that deposits are safely recorded into the store's system and delivered to the bank. The most enjoyable part of my job is closely interacting with my coworkers and customers. We really build a ginuine relationship and it makes work easier. The bad part is not every customer come in with bad attitudes and it just puts everyone in a negative vibe.
good,Breaks and lunch periods were always adequate.  The hardest part of the job was straightening bras and panties on hangers.  The most enjoyable part was the cashiering.
good,Fun  and crazy place ti work! You got all kind of people! Rude people people tht stills crazy people and so on! But for overall is a nice place to star your customer service experience

As a store manager, I know where my employees fit in and where I need to put them. I should be allowed to do so because I know my store better than anyone. Ive increased sales by nearly 20% and they came out with a new system. Now the company has a computer to print your schedule for you.

good,Dollar tree used to be a wonderful company to work for great benefits and and always a new challenge to over come. BUT everything changed about 2 years ago when the regional director retired and district manager left it's like overnite everything changed. There were no hours  given that accomplish required tasks and the managers were always being called out of the stores to help other stores and no payroll was given to help accomplish the tasks needed in other stores usually payroll hours were taken away from the managers who went to help FIX other stores. A 45 hour work week usually became a 60 hour one in order to keep my store as close to company standards as possible. The new district manager in the Memphis area was horrid and impossible to work for the store conditions in the Memphis area especially district 220 are now horrendous. I still shop at dollar tree but it has become like a treasure hunt to shop in all the stores they are empty and dirty.  Just wish someone from corporate would see this and take control of the Memphis area and fix it like it used to be. The most thing I miss is my customers and my emplayers who are still there. 2 years ago I would have suggested dollar tree to anyone Intersted in a good career now not so much until things change in the area.

good,I worked opening shifts and closing shifts..I was the main cashier and mostly the only cashier open unless it gets really busy then I'd have to page my co-worker. The hardest part of the job is when people would buy so many things and I'd had to scan it and put it in the bag myself. Especially when they bought something fragile so I'd have to wrap it up in a news paper. The most enjoyable part of the job is that I met a lot of people cause Im the cashier and they'd tell me how their day was and how'd they compliment me about my name and all that. The management were good.
good,"The job was practically easy we had lots of overtime if you wanted plus lots of off time. Co workers were awesome, managers were fantastic.

good,"A very physical job with a lot of advancement opportunity.  I have learned valuable management skills and continue to apply them on a daily basis.  I am always striving to train and promote management and associates so they can advance in their careers.  The hardest part of this job is the physical activity.  I personally enjoy it, but it can be tiring for someone not able to unload trucks and process freight all day."
good,Worked with this company for 6 years starting as a cashier and working my way to store manager.
good,"The jobs for the day would be relatively standard. I'd have an easy time to get started with my day. They provided the necessary tools, so I could get my job done at a safe and steady pace.

good,In this job I would help blend all sorts of food items.  I also would have the chance to be in the assembly line with other great and dependable workers.

The best part was we would be able to test samples of the great food.
good,"In a typical day at work i would stock some shelves, make sure the whole store was nice and clean including the bathrooms, registers, windows, and floor. The managers were really funny, it made the store a very fun place to be because we would crack jokes but still get our work done in a timely manner. my coworkers were really easy to work with because they were very outgoing and nice.

good,"When I walk in the door it's show time and I hit the ground running. Shelves must be restocked daily. By walking the store, logging it's needs, planning a good, productive schedule, I accomplish most daily goals. I must also be prepared for events that one just cannot plan for.

good,"A typical day at work consisted of front facing products, running the cash register, helping customers find products and stocking the shelves."
good,"Dollar Tree was a great place to work. Unfortunately, the hours are never increased so if you're part time, that's all youll get. I was a manager there and the upper management was very nice and my store manager was very forgiving with the schedule. Raises were pretty regular, you just don't start out making a lot."
good,"I worked at two different Dollar Tree locations, Hickory and Granite Falls. I worked in Hickory for 4 and Granite for 1, and I loved all 5 years. I had occasional problems like any job does, nothing is ever perfect but the experiences were wonderful. I gained a new family, and friends. They were all always there for me. The only semi-bad thing is you can't ever really be full-time as a cashier or even assistant manager, but it is retail so it will always be different."

good,I have been employed here for 1 and half years now and the management is flexible and they work well with everyone
good,"As an associate of Dollar Tree, I had many moments where I was able to grow in my relationships amongst co-workers and customers that come into the store. When I clock in for my shift, I start filling up the necessary prodcuts that sell the quickest. In addition to stocking shelves, I always make sure each and every customer is able to find a product within the store. As an associate you always learn that interaction with the customer will definitely bring a positive upbeat to their day. I've been blessed to work at a workplace where co-workers will help each other out if we are not familiar with an avenue of information about the store to a customer. The hardest part about the job is trying to maneuver around the customers when we are putting out freight onto the shelves. Even though this is the case there are many moments, where it is nice to hear individuals say I like how the store looks. It's definitely an accomplishment when you hears in general. The Dollar Tree that I work at has been number one out of twenty-one stores in the district for consecutive weeks. This makes me proud and gives me pride knowing that people appreciate our service and everything that we do for them. This results in good management from the store manager and the assistant managers."

My coworkers are really great they're all nice people . I really enjoy the management staff they really go out of their way to make me feel like an important asset to the company.

good,"working here was definitely good as a start out job. I learned a lot as the years i grew within the company. once i got promoted i learned more about freight, stocking, paperwork and the cash handling such as being able to open safe and have responsibility to open and close store."
good,Dollar Tree is a good place to work for the people who want to work there every day if your overnight stockers though it's only seasonal and you got to find another job through the rest of the year so I decided I had to move on
good,"I did enjoy my short employment at and with dollar tree managers mrs.Kc and mrs.Kathy are eeal good at being their  for the costumers employees and the company"
good,"Calm place "
good,"Store is what employee/manager makes it. If there is good steady team work and task training, then the scheduled task get easier to do. Management and employee's need to focus on bite size task repetitions."
good,I worked for the company a long time and it a very nice place . Even though there are something the company need to work on it’s not my place to address it.
good,"clock in go to work"
good,"A normal day at work would be a small rush, cleaning up the stores, doing go-backs, restocking shelves. Take a 10 minute break with pay after four hours or so and then take a 30 minute break without pay if you work more than five hours. The employees I work with are friendly, fun, and easy going to work with. Even though time flys by while I’m at Dollar Tree I enjoy every moment while working there. I do not regret it."
good,A tipical day of work is alittle tuff cause it can be competitive with the job rate and plenty more challenging job assigned to your mod or zone of work but once you find your balance with your work assignment everything else comes together.
good,"Great pay. A good job to move up and gain incredible knowledge in the retail industry. Overall, this job is a 10/10 with pay, experience and skill. Would love to go back."
good,"It would sometimes be fast-paced, usually slow during the weekdays"
good,I had worked for dollar tree a long time.  I loved the retail environment.  It was a wonderful place to work.  I would definitely recommend to anyone.
good,I started out as a Christmas hire pt cashier. Within six months I was promoted to ASM Merch and have been in this position for a year now and have received 3 raises so far and since I’ve been in this position my store has bonused every month. I am now being considered for store manager trainee. Dollar tree is just what you make of it. I love my job
good,Stocker at over night and cashier in the evening working with good people meeting new people of the area learning new tasks doing new projects making the store better for the people.
good,"Right off the bat it was an awesome place to work. No the pay wasnt great, but for a part time job you cant expect to become a millionaire. Employees were cool to work with management was even better. Always had something to do and most of the time if you were overwhelmed with customer, someone was always there to help out with anything from blowing up balloons to opening another register."
good,If you are looking for a company that offers the opportunity for advancement and competative pay Dollar Tree is the right place. Within 6 months I went from being a cashier to a part time assistant manager to a full time operations manager.
good,"Dollar Tree was a great company to work for. They thoroughly train their employees and offer promotions regularly. It's a fairly easy job with low stress and great pay, depending on what your local minimum wage is."
good,"Helping others always smile, if it’s a bad day you could make someone else’s day, never be afraid to ask someone if they need help! Always ask questions and stay alert"
good,"If you are just starting out, it is a great place to work. Training was good and easy to learn. Job roles are easy. Only thing is when they only schedule one person to work and it gets busy."
good,"the work place is spectacular expect for a few exceptions,but that's a given in the workplace. However, you must still work but it's a balance ,and well pace work. You'll get caught up in rushes and slums but just keep going you'll understand later the true atmosphere"
good,I liked working there it was just a hassle because there was a lot of stocking that needed to be done and to just have to work fast and make sure things are looking good in the shelf's and not sloppy
good,Great job to start from the bottom and work your way up. great way to learn new tasks to take with you for an advancement opportunity. The hardest part of the job would be eating sleeping and breathing retail.
good,As a part time employee its a good place to work.Management is good in behaviour and work schedule is flexible.Some times they do ask you to do some odd work.
good,I have learned how to be fast paced in a work environment. I respect and work well with my fellow employees and employers. I am learning alot about unloading freight trucks and stocking the shelves of the store quickly but at the same time effectively to convenient the customer and try to keep the product moving sufficiently. The most enjoyable part of the job is when management or an employee compliments me on a job well done.
good,"Very easy job. Depending on location the customers are nice and have great manner, so its easy to be a good cashier. During the day you help people fin what they need stock and clean up the store."
good,"There are definitely opportunities for advancement "
good,My manager was really nice and the hours were great. I would go in and clock in and get on the register and when a customer needed balloons i would blow up balloons and I would stock when I wasnt busy. Then at the end of my shift I would count my drawer and print a reciept and give it to my manager and clock out. The most enjoyable part was interacting with the customers.
good,"i had a great experience there i can't complain too much about it. it's great for first time job seekers, its pretty basic with the opportunity to move up."
good,Shirt are short 4 -hours goes by who been there only ru. Back ground if management is offered and buzzy fast paced girls mean kind and store always dirty bathroom don't use .

good,Dollar tree is a fun work place It gets busy with the help of managers and coworkers working together you can get things done fast .Problem is they dont give that much hours of working .
good,"Got to be fast and ready to work. Good place if you are looking for a part time job. Very easy and relaxed place. If you enjoy working with people, this is a good job for you."
good,"Was my first legit job. Easy work, unless on register people are mean. The location i worked at is now closed but it was a great place to work. People were super friendly and helpful. Manager was switched half way through employment and allowed me to take on more responsibilities. They also accommodated work hours for school schedules."
good,"Dollar is a fun place to work at, everyone cares about each other and is always willing to help. The different and unique products that we receive every week are amazing and grabs the attention of our daily and weekly customers. I've learned a lot of great customer service working here especially being patient and kind with everyone. This is one thing I'm going to take with me, being patient goes a long way. A typical day includes welcoming guest, stocking, cashing customers out and helping them look for products they're looking for. Overall, Dollar Tree is a great place and has a fun atmosphere to work at."
good,"it was a productive place to work, it paid the bills, you had the major holidays days off, dont get me wrong it had its down falls but again it was a job"
good,"Everyday as the merchandising manager I would start my shift by counting safe, then get a plan made for shift, write up plan for each employee, fill out stock sheets, load u boats per department on daily action plan for stocking, change end caps to Corp plan o gram, at the end of every shift I would calculate all boxes employees stocked and make sure back room was clean and stacked safely, record all my numbers and hand shift over to next manager"
good,I enjoyed working at Dollar Tree. The Manager and all other associates were very friendly and helpful. I loved checking in freight and putting it away. I just wish this job wasn't just part time
good,"Dollar Tree is a great place to look for a first job. It was easy to get an application and fill it out.The training was very easy to understand. If you have any question while you are training, the person that is training you will do there best to answer all your questions."
good,you must be a multitasker. As a manager you're the leader of the store. Therefore everyone reports to you and you have to know how to prioritize tasks effectively.
good,It was a fun and exciting place to work at every day. The staff was great to work with. The management was good in recognizing your accomplishments and advanced you.
good,A typical day at work would be to make sure the customers was satisfied and making sure the shelves was stick with product at all time. I learned about merchandising. Management was very easy to get along with. The hardest part was truck day and having to get all the product out. the enjoyable part was all the different people you get to meet.
good,It was cool just was helping set new store up. I help build the shelfs and help load all the new things in the store off of  truck I helped with grand opening of the store .
good,"An typical day of work consisted greeting customers, ringing customers up, and also stocking up the aisles. Every employee made sure the work environment was clean."
good,Hardest part was the speed because christmas was around the corner. Organization was my least favorite. The management was really good.
good,"This job filled up my evenings. The manager, workers, and customers were nice. There was not a lot of instruction. The hardest part was being let go because it was a seasonal position."
good,"unloaded a semi truck with new store items to stock, placed items in isles, organized items being brought in by the semi in specific boats to be taken to the floor"
good,"had a good experience while I was employed there.had a good working relationship with supervisors,and fellow employee's.the commute was difficult and was forced to resign my employment there."
good,"Managers work fantastic to work with, I felt like it could somewhat be myself in the workplace. Very clean and very polite. The managers helped out with cashiering when needed"
good,"When I worked there the atmosphere was good. Staff helped each other out when needed. Also, the staff was willing to help customers out and knew how to handle difficult situations. Management were great. The store in general is awesome. I don't mind spending a dollar for certain items."
good,I like working there I learned about management and they taught me about how to paperwork. I learned more about stock work and unloading trucks
good,"It was actually a good place to work at, the coworkers were friendly, the hours were good and it was really close to where I lived  it just wasn't my kind of store to work for."
good,"When you get to work we all exchange our hellos and get straight to our tasks for the day. If anyone needs assistance, the managers are quick to help. One person is never given a job too big without help to complete it. Also very good with working around your home schedule. I highly recommend working at the Dollar Tree in Klamath Falls Oregon. The staff their is incredible."
good,"*timely"
good,Very easy and relaxing job. Management is flexible and employees are nice and fun to work with...........................
good,"Management is good-humored, understanding, and fun. Very few times have I been honored to work in a place so coordinated and yet fun. Managers keep the day light with humor and joy while keeping everyone on task and not letting people slide or do less than everyone else (except in extenuating circumstances, when they are incredibly understanding)"
good,"Lots of aspects came with working at the Dollar Tree:"
good,"It was amazing work at dollar tree the manager and team"
good,"Hours worked well with college schedule."
good,"Scheduling at work varies; at times I am scheduled for the morning shift and have to do my daily routine as a cashier. However, I am also scheduled in the evenings and  have to do recovery around the store. Keeping the store clean and organized is part of my daily routine. I go in early mornings and stock the aisles with new merchandise. I learned work ethic, time management, how to approach customers in different situations, customer service and meeting deadlines. The management is fair."
good,A typically day at work is a fast paced environment with a high volume of customers. We work together as a team to complete tasks and make sure everything is done by the end  of the day. I learned a lot from working at Dollar Tree as well as a lot from my co workers. The management is phenomenal I have never worked with such great people before. The hardest part of my job is when ever I make a mistake or don't complete something that was needed to be done. I'm a really hard worker and I don't like to make mistakes. Almost everything about my job is enjoyable most days are pretty busy and it's kinda fun it also makes the time go by faster.
good,"Just about anybody you work with is very friendly and willing to help if you ask politely. The work isn't very hard until around the holiday times. I personally don't like cleaning up after others, but the customers who speak to you make it doable. I enjoyed the friendships I created while at this job."
good,"I worked here as a second job and the manager, Kyle, scheduled me so I could do both. He was a great manager and everyone loved working for him because he ran the store very well and was respectful to everyone. If he's a product of Dollar Tree's training then they're doing pretty good. Hours are alright and pays the basic, so all in all good place to work."
good,I enjoyed myself at Dollar Tree. I loved the people there. I loved taking on the responsibilities as an Assistant Manager.
good,"On November 2011 through December 2011, I started working at Dollar Tree as a Cashier/Stocker while I was in high school. The position that I applied for was Part-time because but I did not know it was Seasonal. During my time there, I started being greeter by saying ""Hello and Welcome to Dollar Tree! How may I be of assistance to you?"" whenever a customer walks in the door. Also, I've done inventory to whenever the produce was low, I would put in more and more produce to fill in the shelves so that way the customers would see more than just empty shelves. I have excellent social skills because I am a people person for example, if a customer needs something and cannot look for it, they ask me where the specific produce or product is and I would tell them and/or lead them to the aisle that they are looking for but I would also recommend the customer a different product/produce because I would think it will be better for them. While I was still working for Dollar Tree, I called in to see if my boss or if the co-workers needed me and they did not so by the next time I called again, my boss told me that she did not need my services anymore and that is how I became a laid-worker."
good,"Cashier, stock shelves, direct customer service. When not on register we would stock the shelves with the new product.  Also, part of the job was to announce items of the week."
good,"come to work, punch in and count out a tilt for me. if it's not busy organize the Go Backs and put them back or go look for Go Backs down the ails. if its busy go up to your register and ring up the customers. my co-workers are fun to work with and it makes the day go by fast because you have your friends around you. there really isn't a hard part of the day, once you get the hang of the job your doing it gets easy to do. the most enjoyable about working there is meeting new people that walk threw the store and being with your friends that you like working with."
good,"A typical day at work was hectic and crowded, but a lot of fun too. I learned to stay on top of things. Management was friendly and attentive. My coworkers were great and always helped with problems I couldn't manage. The hardest part of the job was sticking to one task, I always have the tendency to go do something else instead of an assigned assignment. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the customers and making sure they were happy before they left the store"
good,Where I work it's a joy to work at everyone is friend. You always have something to do from ranges from cleaning to stocking shelves. You meet a lot of wonderful people at this job and you form great relationship with costumers.
good,welll dollar tree was the best i wish i can go back there anytime . everything a dollar work was great other then unloading the truck  pushing the u boats was great setting endcaps and sale
good,i enjoyed going to work to see everyone and all of the costumers. I learned how to be quick when there was a line. The hardest part of the job was trying to manage keeping the front end straightened while there were a lost of people in the store.
good,I would go to work and count down my cash register and at that time I know the day would never be boring. I loved my co workers and the manager everyone got alone very well and we all made each other laugh to pass by the day. The job was filled with an equal balance and fun the best way to have it.
good,"get stared "
good,"A typical day at work for me would be a day where I go in at 8 have no customers until 10 and then they all pile up at the register at once. The one good thing about having the 2 hours with no customers is it gives you time to put up stock if you have it or clean up around your area. I learned a lot about customer service and how to handle customers whether they be happy or upset. I really enjoyed my co-workers. We always worked as a team. None of us minded helping each other. The most enjoyable part of my job was my customers. It was my home away from home. You meet different people and learn a lot. The worst part would have to be truck day when you are trying to unload the truck, trying to stock the shelves, trying to blow up balloons and run a register."
good,"I love working at dollar Tree. I felt like i was needed, by my customer, and my co-worker and if i needed help and i felt that they back if something happen in the store. "
good,a day at work there wasnt bad it was like a day at the gym . it is very physically demanding but it is worth it. i lost a lot of wait working there. and everyone one there was very nice. the only bad part of them is when stuff gets slow they will find any reason to let you go. the hardest part of the job is the heat. 
good,Dollar Tree Distribution is a great warehouse to work at with great managers 
good,"My typical work day would be coming in speaking to everyone including the customers. I go to the office where the manager was and check out a drow for my line that i was in that day, afterwards I would go to my station sign in and start greeting and checking out customers. If i didnt have any customers in line i would do sort back which that provides all the items that dont belong in that certain aisle's and put them back in there right spot, I also clean and sweep. The hardest part about the job was to make sure i cashed out correctly, wasnt over to much nor short to much. The most enjoyable thing about my job was my co-workers, manager, and the customers who always was nice to me and rememebered my name and always wanted to come to my line."
good,"Dollar tree is a friendly fun place to work at. Multitasking job anwersing phones, getting grocery carts, working the cash register an scaning costumers items, daily announcements, and on slow days blow balloons up and organize shelfs."
good,"I have worked as a cashier and in customer service. I also posses experience in warehouse,restaurant, and inventory. As manager,my primary responsibility was to operate the stores. I did this maintaining standards and motivating the staff to achieve maximum performance. I have excellent communication skills, both written and verbal."
good,Mulitasking is a must in the retail business. There is always someone who needs your help whether it be a customer or an employee and it is hard to be in five different places at once being in a management postion. Deligation is a must to be productive and you must keep your priorities in order. Staying busy makes the days pass quickly especially when you have a good work enviroment and good team work.
good,"Great Staff,you can go as far as you want with a career at Dollar Tree.Learning all about the job,the in's and outs. Marketing, signage.Whats new and comming."
good,I sit up the store the stayed on a cashier /stocker. then was offered a job as manger great job
good,I loved working there I mean the people were great and it was easy to ask for help and cashiering was easy customer service being a backup manager was nice I mean it was great working there I loved it.
good,"Pay started at min wage, then $11.75 as ft mgr, salary paid for store manager. Salary would have been worth it but qe weren't given enough hours to schedule employees. As the SM I got stuck working 6-7 days a week, with 3 or 4 of them days being open to close. Being on salary I was paid for 48 hrs a week while actually working 60+. I had no work/home balance."
good,I don't have anything bad to say. I enjoyed my time working with the company. I regret that my health prevented me from doing my job. But Dollar Tree is definitely a great company to work for. I would recommend anyone to work there.
good,"I love working at dollar tree, I have regulars who come in and we sit and chat. The location I work at is clean and well kept. The management is amazing, and they are very good at what they do. The only problem I see is that they don’t pay very well, 8.50 an hour for cashiers. Sometimes the schedule can vary, and I get good hours, or not so many hours. I wish I was paid more."
good,"Unloading truck can get quit overwhelming when you have a very little space to run off of, a lot of heavy lifting, double truck days can get confusing, sticking heavy stuff sometimes can get to you"
good,"Great work place, with awesome people. Rarely ever had problems and everything that needed to be resolved, took less than 10 minutes. This job really developed more skills and made me a better social person."
good,"I enjoy my job as store manager  and love my work family,  the public,  the job and all it entails.  I wish though as an sm that our district manager would be more assesable.  Answer questions,  listen to suggestions. I've always loved resets, plan building.. in all it is a good job. I've been there 10 plus years so I must be doing something right."
good,"Es un buen lugar para trabajar, con un ambiente agradable."
good,"Enjoyed working there. like anywhere else always an issue with freight vs payroll."
good,"A typical day at work involves me traveling to 2-3 stores, walking the stores with my Store Managers, giving notes on what needs to be addressed while giving recognition and praise for accomplishments. "
good,"The opportunity to advance into management is everywhere and if they see your work ethic it can happen quickly. Sometimes there aren’t enough hours. Overall, a good company to work for and good for long term if you get into management."
good,I was promoted within about a month into working for the company. I enjoyed my coworkers a lot!                                                       .
good,They really do try to teach to how to stock. They want you to work fast.  Towards the end of the week he expects you to know how to do the work.You will received a name tag and they doesn't really tell me you how to dress since I worked overnight. You take a 10 minute break.
good,"A typical day at work from 5am to about noon-ish sometimes longer was very easy going. You got to know the regulars who would come in. You've got to want to be helpful and know where things are sound the store cause everyone would always ask if knew where so and so is. I learned to become a better person, a more caring individual. The management is very good at what they do. The work place culture is one of a kind. The hardest part of the job is keeping up to tip top shape. Bring the biggest store in MN we do more then alright on our part. The most enjoyable party of the job is getting to know so many different types of people, it makes it stay interesting."
good,Nothing is too complex to learn cashiering or stocking and daily tasks are very consistent it's a pretty good stepping stone for my plans for the future and would be a great starting job.
good,"I really liked working here, the schedules were steady, the people were awesome, and the customers were brighting to your spirit. I learned management skills here and basic operations to running a store!"
good,"Working overnight can be strenuous. The job entails a lot of pressure and no time to get some of the work done. The company does not give enough of people to carry the workload. As an overnight manager I had to pull at times more weight than the workers. The hours for a part time associate are little to none."
good,The workplace culture was inviting and productive. The workplace guidelines were easy to understand. All associates were helpful. Hours were flexible.
good,Working on Dollar Tree is a great place to interact with customers from different places and countries. It is a fast paced work environment. Managers are great leaders.
good,Dollar Tree was a team building workplace. It was very busy and i also had to work overnight shift and got to train other nee coworkers. Dollar tree is an overgrowth company. Keep up the good work.
good,i enjoyed working with the customers each day. We worked together as a team to get the job done. It was a job where there was always work to be done.it was fun.
good,"Dollar Tree isn't a bad place to work at all, you just have to be on top of your game when you start. I say that because most of all you're handling other people money and you don't want to cheat them out their money and you don't want the customer to cheat you out of a job."
good,"typical shift would involve me standing in front of the cash register to complete purchases, and reorganizing shelves and helping out workers when there's no customers present at the register."
good,Always more than enough work to go around. If you're the type of person that is always trying to work overtime than this is the place for you. You also have to ability to hit bonus if you like to work harder than the bare min.
good,"The Dollar Tree Distribution Center in Marietta, Oklahoma is a wonderful place to work. Currently, there are more Dollar Tree's in the United States than McDonald's. Therefore, there is a huge opportunity for advancement. They have a phenomenal management team, excellent benefits, and great pay."
good,"Have more people at check stands (at least 1more) people stocking trained in checkstand work so we don't have to call manager.keep people that are doing there best even if they are a little slow,get rid of late and workers that are late abuse breaks."
good,Dollar Tree is a good place to work at everyone that works at Dollar Tree our team players the company lacks in resources that all Associates including management has to work together at the end of the day to make the store run. Very fun and easy
good,"A typical day at Dollar Tree is starting a shift and making sure you know what your'e supposed to do prior to coming to work. a lot of inventory needs to be done, you have to make sure youre ready to take care of shipments coming in adn making sure your cashiers are ok throughout their shifts."
good,"Great enviroment, quick promotion, friendly and motivated staff. The company needs to invest in security and more protecton for stores and staff. They need to adjust hrs to accommodate freight workers. Lastly management pay should be properly increased."
good,This has been a very good experiance i have enjoyed working with this company it has been a place i would recomend people.  the company has a good management and very clean and is a good place
good,"I loved the job I did. The managment and staff was friendly and super productive. There was always something to be done, never bored. The location was close by tp where I lived."
good,Great workplace very good management and fair just not enough hours. But very happy to have the opportunity to work for the Dollar Tree. If there is position available I would take.
good,Good place to work at and also has good benefits. The starting pay is $10.50 which isnt bad at all. It is easy work and you do not slave out there at all.
good,It was a nice place to work! Manager was patient and friendly. It was flexible with my schedule as well and they trained me and i was able to learn everything pretty quick!
good,Friendly environment and good customer service. The overall start is a little to get use to but the store becomes your second home. Scheduling and management are good if not great and no one ever gets left behind because everyone works together to make it the best experience at a local retail store.
good,I like the job because you get to meet a lot of new faces different attitudes.Also Management was good but unfortunately the job was seasonal. They good with giving hours also.
good,"I  love working at this job and overall its a smooth fast pace job, and has great opportunity. Also it's a great place to work for plus it has health care plans, and different excited ideas goin on."
good,It allows you to gain knowledge of the buissness world and teaches you how to see the people you serve as more then just another thing to get over with during the day
good,"My management was understanding, respectful, and helpful. The environment was relaxing but hard-working as well when it came to stocking merchandise on shelves. I didn't have much trouble with customers, it was more so a mutual relationship. The most enjoyable part of the job was break time and the hardest or most annoying part of the job was truck day whereas myself and others collected merchandise from our scheduled truck drivers in the stock room and placed them in their respective sections. I learned that you needed a respectful and dependable work team and to negotiate a decent wage for yourself depending on what it is you are getting paid to do for your job."
good,"I like my job a lot because i get to meet many nice people, i also work with very friendly team . we all work hard together. I enjoy keeping everything clean and tidy ."
good,Overall this is a great working place for non experience workers. A job is a job so I cant complain.... its work. You do have supportive management on the team. Its about how you grow and develop in this business. That means its not all about money/numbers. You will be comfortable around everyone cause everyone works together and gets along great.
good,"Assist the store manager with daily activities and delegate tasks to employees. I learned how to manage employees and multitask. The management and co- workers are great and get you through those tough days. The hardest part of the job is trying to please and help every customer to the best of your abilities, even in situations out of your control. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with the public and getting to know your customers."
good,I was responsible for the operations and profitable sales at my location. What I loved most about the job was all the challenges and merchandising the products. Dollar Tree is a very well organized company and always implementing changes to keep up with the demands of business. There was a great support system and the coworkers became like family. The hardest part about the job was times that I needed to work extended hours and wasn't able to spend as much time with my family. No matter what I would do it all over again.
good,"I was the Store Manger. I Started with 20hrs a week. I had the opportunity to continue to work more hours. Within a couple of months I was promoted to Assistant Store Manager had the opportunity to train and work with other Store manager, around my area. After about  year I had a good opportunity to continue growing and was promoted to Store Manager. The best part of my job was that I got to train all of my team. The good thing about that was everyone knew there responsibilities. It was a Fun, Exciting and very fast moving environment."
good,I really enjoyed this job. There were different jobs and assignments all the time. The work was hard but always fun to learn new things. Plus I enjoy labor work. I worked with one guy all the time so it wasn't with a lot of coworkers. The hardest part was the hours and the heavy lifting and of course the valleys but I got used to it.
good,Working at Dollar Tree was one of the easiest jobs I've had. Not much hard labor as a Cashier.
good,i would get there and unload trucks and stock shelves and make sure the store is clean and up to par with management.
good,I had a very good time working for Dollar Tree during the summer. The associates were very friendly as well as the manager.
good,It was an ok place to start working when I moved to Grass Valley. I never done retailing before so it was good to learn something new. 
good,fun work place i loved stocking the shelves and unloading the truck
good,"with cashiering theres never enough hours, but I love that job usual the hours flew by"
good,"I love working at the Dollar Tree. Management was amazing. I feel like the listened. They were extremely encouraging and wanted me to be the best of the best, but they wanted me to be me the very most. I wish I had got a little longer to spend with them, but it was only a seasonal job."
good,recieving and sending out boxes also clean work area helping company buyers doing displays
good,"Working at Dollar Tree I learned many things. I learned how to handle money, perform specific tasks, how to stock shelves and how to communicate with customers and co-workers. The management was very ethical and the co-workers were friendly. I did not find any part about this job to be difficult. My co-workers always made it clear and understandable on what needed to be done and how to perform the task. The most enjoyable part about this job was the enviroment. Everyone got along and as long as you did your duties, there weren't any problems."
good,"Dollar Tree is an easy place work. Customers and employees are all very nice. Management is will to work with you, so you do not feel like you are working for someone, but working with them. The hardest part of my job is dealing with upset customers, it is a very tricky thing. The thing i enjoy most about my work is talking with the other employees and getting to know them better."
good,C was rude she would send me home over clothes I was wearing when there would be 5 other people in the store wearing the same thing she's racist and she cusses like a sailor she doesn't care who hears that that up Bethany and that's the store that I helped to build I don't remember her name but she's horrible I was told I couldn't come back to work without a doctor's my doctor's note I  Then she fired me for not calling in every day she said I had banded in my postcalled to see if I was on the schedule she told me yeah sure come in
good,"The work is fair and the managers are great, but the pay is too low for anything beyond a starting position, like a first job. The job can be tiring, but do your best and you will do well."
good,It's a fast paced job I like it keeps me busy like my hours I'm always on time and do what I'm ask to do with no problem responsible and respect everyone.
good,"great to work somewhere where everthing is literally a dollar. based on your team, you can do great things and boost sales for the store and get the customers coming back happy."
good,Team members already know where what to do with day by walking the isle's before store opening and quickly restock areas where said so employee works with his or her other crew member.
good,"I am currently a Store Manager at one of the highest volume stores in the company. I have also run a much smaller volume store. The work is what you make of it. Dollar Tree, like any other business, is here to make money. So, with that in mind, some unrealistic expectations can be held by individuals who don't quite grasp the finer points of business. However, for anyone to rate the company as a whole, based off of experiences at a single location, working a single role.... hard to do. My opinion, store, district and regional level leadership can often lead some to have a bad taste in there mouth. First step is to look in the mirror and ask 'am I doing everything I can and should be doing'. My experiences are positive, having worked myself up to the position I have."
good,"Ability to move up within the company. Good retirement plan. DM""s are always available for guidance. Conference calls are weekly and manager meetings are every quarter."
good,My review on Dollar Tree
good,"Awesome place to work for a high schooler , and also for someone who is retired of work.  This place also had the best discounts and very good pay rate"
good,"I worked at the dollar tree while obtaining an associates degree, they are flexible with hours and staff was wonderful its more the clients that can be extremely stressful, due to area and many shoppers."
good,I enjoyed the time i worked for this company. I got along well with the management and employees that i worked with and was even able to train certain people.
good,Management is great. Has good flexibility and work/life balance. Everyone is super friendly and helpful. If job stability is a must this is a good place to be.
good,its nice to work at Dollar tree.i love my job. Nice people to work with and good management. The only reason why i need to look for other job is im planning to move to BC.
good,It was my first job when I moved to Illinois. The Customer base was nice. Management was nice but hired far too many people instead of giving the other workers more hours.
good,Great place to work enjoyed the experience and the environment was sad when the owners changed our I would be working there today since then business has changed and not for the good
good,When I at the dollar tree it was great I have my own spot. The supervisor tell us what positions to stock in the morning. And on Wednesday we come early start unloading truck. The most like people great personality  make you feel comfortable working there.
good,"I worked there over ten years ago. It was a wonderful company at that time. It was fun and fast paced.  It's been a decade since I worked there, so it's hard for me to give real feedback."
good,It was a good experience. The manager was okay at some moments. Most customers were really friendly. Most of the co-workers were good workers. The only thing that was wrong that the manager didn't correct was the workers being messy and unprofessional.
good,The manager really works with your schedule. There's plenty of work to keep you busy. The pay isn't the best but if you prove yourself there are opportunities for advancement.
good,"A typical day of work is stocking the shelves, taking care of the cashiers, make sure the customers leave satisfied. I learned how to become a manager and what it takes to be in a position where you have to make sure everything is running properly. My coworkers weren't that great I feel that Dollar Tree can use new workers that have a positive mindset and that actually care about having a job. The hardest part of my job was satisfying customers, because you will have to always be friendly and keep the customers satisfied even though they can be really rude to you. The most enjoyable part of my job would be the customer's even though there are not nice customers there are some customers that will make me laugh and are fun to talk with."
good,"I enjoyed working at Dollar Tree. You walked around a lot (as a manager or stocker) so it was like working out and getting paid for it. The store I worked at was very strict when it came to breaks and lunches. The store manager would get in trouble if a break or lunch was missed. I enjoyed the people I worked with. They were all hard workers. I enjoyed stocking and making the store look good (the customers would come in and mess it up, so there is always something to do). This would be a good starter job or to supplement income, but I would not make a career out of it."
good,"co workers were friendly and helpful always things to keep all busy on a daily bases had great insurance ,management very helpful when things would come about ,I was taught to run the company as if I was the manager if in case they were unable to be there for any long term '"
good,Going to work on a typical day was an exciting one. The employees and employers always had a positive attitude. I learned how to work at a faster pace at dollar tree. The most enjoyable part of the job was dealing with the customers at the cash registers.
good,"A typical day in the morning is following appleseed, which is a daily plan for the day of what I have to accomplish. I have learn how to run a business, and what to expect of the company I work for. I also learn how to deal with all types of personallities with the employee's and the customers. Being in management helps me to apply being respected and also to give respect. How to deal with the business and what and how much to give of myself. My co-workers are just like any one else. We try to think positive everyday and I make sure that they enjoy what they do. The hardest part of my job is to see someone terminate themselve. Because I try to work with everyone I work with, and If they can't work for me they won't make it. Because I agree to help and work with inmates that may need a second chance in life, that not many places will give a second chance. And I have seem some of them excel above what they expected to do. I like to see peole advance in growth and enjoy what they do. I enjoy my customers and I love the elders, because they get my upmost respect, and I call almost all my customers by their first name."
good," Great Customer experience"
good,good day at work
good,Typical day at Dollar Tree is hands on all the time. Learned how different price points are nt always needed. Higher level management was great. Co-workers were great to work with. There was nt a hard part of the job. The most enjoyabale was meeting the differnet guess that shopped.
good,i like working with my coworkers and manager they r very nice and kind and i enjoy being there
good,i loved working at dollar tree day to day duties include socking cleaning and merchandising..I've have learned many things how to manage my time better i have improved my customer service skills management was wonderful co-worker are awesome hardest part of the job was trying to complete your task and help customers
good,With everything that they ask us to do it’s definitely an underpaid job unloading truck box by box for four to five hours the having to process most of the chemicals before you can clock out never having enough room to stock everything and only getting a few hours a day to get a uboat with over a hundred or so boxes stocked it’s almost impossible
good,The only reason i put pay cuase i have 3 kids and thay are giveing bad hours so im trying to get as much as i can i am a stocker and a cashier and i unload the truck its ok just bad pay and hours
good,"My boss was amazing with the schedule, when I worked there I was working at another job at the same time, she was able to help me out if needed so I was always on time to me second job, everyone was really nice, training was easy, very easy job"
good,Dollar tree always have what customers wants. They have wonderful customer skills and care about what customer wants and needs. They are very friendly and have a wonderful team of management
good,I have to leave because i move pretty far from there and the manger only gave me some days for work..i think the customers was great and we can takes breaks and have a nice lunch and i like how clean dollar tree are...
good,Great job to have the managers will work out things with you and make sure you understand your task the customers make the job fun a great job to have.
good,Great place to work fast pace always a new adventure you get to use your management skill in every day situations you can build you team of employees to make your work load work
good,The job itself is laid back and I enjoyed it. My boss worked with my schedule and was very flexible and understanding. Work environment was laid back but you also stayed busy.
good,I like working here because I had a great boss that worked with me n was understanding the team was good if I need help there were there so a team we did it
good,It was a real easy job . But the hours I only was working 2 to 3 days a week . I was not satisfied with the hours at all . The employees or very nice and sweet
good,"Poor management, overall great work environment, fast paced environment, competitive work environment. great customer base. nice people, nice customer base"
good,The Job at Dollar tree is fast paced on your feet at all times. Can't be shy have to be talkative and open minded. Pay attention to what you are assigned to do.
good,a typical day at dollar tree was motoring the cashiers. unloading and stocking the truck.opening and closing the store. taking the deposit to the bank
good,Was a cashier... Also helped with truck and stalked shelves... Was great job I loved it... I only left because a tornado hit the store... Was no longer there and I moved away shortly after that
good,I truly enjoyed my time at dollar tree. I found out a lot about working in retail with the company. I don't have anything negative to say.. We had an amazing run!
good,It was will put in order when I got in staff was real cool an it was so busy time always went fast grate staff it was never a day when I did not want to work they made me fell like I was part of the family
good,Always busy which kept me occupied throughout my shift. It was a very fun place to start at. Being there for 3 years allowed me to get to know a lot of the customers. I loved being able to help a customer when needed. The hardest part of the job I would have to say would be customers getting upset over the fact that Dollar Tree doesn't do returns or store credit. The most enjoyable part of the job would be working with great co-workers.
good,"Dollar tree is a good job when first starting off. Wouldnt recommend making it a career. Its a decent job though, nothing wrong with it. Business like and ran very professionally"
good,was a ok place to work. Management needs to be more friendly to employees and not have favorites. Schedule was flexible.
good,"I learned that this is a fun but nice environment to work at, fun meeting new people. nothing hard about the job, managers were always understanable"
good,"Cash register experience, nice employers, responsibility, customer satisfaction priority, greater chance for advancement. A large store with more to choose from."
good,"This job was so amazing, I loved it there, could have used more hours and i would have made this my career. Best job ever!...."
good,cool company to work for. not enough hours they only offer part time. no raises the year and half I was there. really stressful during seasonal. cool management laid back work place.
good,The first store I started in left alot of room for me to get trained; we moved into a much bigger store and got more experience. Hardest part was being the youngest in a store that had employees who were there more than five years.
good,"Management is lacking and doesn’t want to work, wants to just sit in the office,  company expects to much for little wages. Want you to do several things at one time.  But they say customer service is the key goal, it is not."
good,"Dollar Tree is laid back for the most part. Wasn't a bad job as long as you strictly want low pay, short hours. The co-workers were good people. Easy to get along with, and it was nice gaining work family as well as growing a friendship with even the customers."
good,To Be Cashier i learned to multitask  and have a fun attitude and customers will want to come back to you. If you have a bad attitude it will show on your performance
good,Fun place to work yet the hours and money are not. Not very easy to move up either..its an open door company ..would only recommend to young people as a jumping off point to a real job.
good,hate this job but loved the coworkers manager would never stock sits in his office and do nothing
good,Great place to shop not so great to work. Not enough coverage and management definitely needs to be retained on customer service skills and employee treatment.
good,"one day she is your best friend the next she is hating you and everyone else, lots of gossip brings home problems to work. if she is having a bad day expect everyone to have one as well... as a person i enjoy her as a boss not at all"
good,Very fast pace you have to have good customer service and willing to work The hours that they give you meds have a good attitude and have a very good patients to work at the Doubletree
good,I was able to go to work and touch many lives. I made my customers very happy with great customer service. The most enjoyable part was seeing the smiles on there faces.
good,"depending on the shift you got it ranged from early morning stocking to basic cash register management to evening janitorial duties. I learned how to use my people person skills the correct way as well has how to communicate with very difficult people and of course the customer is always right. management was not very good while I was working at this store, we would have a new manager every few months. I adored the coworkers I worked with. They made the job a lot less stress full. This job was fairly easy once you got a hang of the routine. The only thong was you couldn't get the schedule you wanted as goes for any job. Everything from my daily customers to my coworkers."
good,It was a stable job. I greeted customers and rung they items. Made sure my areas was clean. Sometimes I did a little stocking. And closed with coworker.
good,We had we have been working for several months without a store manager well we finally got one she did not introduce herself to me as who she was and how she would look like for things to be handled just simply gave me mighty old which is the money that I sought working with and would not allow me to verify it told me that this is how she do and their policy is that if
good,"I loved being apart of the Dollar Tree staff. However, it was hard to advance in this job because they wouldn't allow me to work more than eight hours a week."
good,"A typical day at dollar tree is a 4 hour shift where you will cashier and stock shelves between customers. You meet alot of people and learn alot about retail and what makes products sell. "
good,Typical retail position dealing with the public - stocking shelves with truck freight very physical (thus getting exercise) - Occasional great deals would come in unexpectedly
good,It's very busy and certain day and holidays you learned a lot like how to work the register and etc.Our manager is always making sure we task and some of our co-workers barely like to work or show up for work. Their is nothing hard about this job. The most enjoyable part of the job is stocking and making sure customers find everything they need.
good,"Dollar Tree of East Brunswick, NJ was a retail environment with great hours, flexible work and great people to work with."
good,i thought they had to many managers on the floor at one to many people did not know what they where doing
good,I worked for Dollar Treeand was a dedicated and loyal employee for over 4 years. In that time period I received one raise (for 15 cents) and was treated very unfairly. I was interested in a management position and the DM lied and told me there was something that came up on my backgroud check. This is impossible bc I have absolutely no record! My father however was a DM in another district and LOVED his career. They treated him very well. I would not recommend Dollar Tree unless you are a store manager or higher.
good,"I stayed busy and enjoyed working with the customers. Hard work had to sometimes running cashier, stocking taking balloon orders and ringing customers up."
good,People are nice and very understanding. Working with the company has been a good experience. The customer were nice. The hours are wonderful. Co-workers work together to make the store a team
good,this job was a good job had no problems there at all i had some family problems and had to quit or else i would still be working there today great work environment.
good,management was the biggest issue working there they did not want to help when the lines were long only cashier until 4 hours
good,It is very fast paced place to work. I had to learn where everything is located.  I have to clean the store at night before I leave. I have to set up for the deliveries on Monday nights also.
good,It was ok I enjoyed the management there but I worked there over the holidays and it was extremely busy. Awesome management and people I am really sad I had to move.
good,"The new manager was too inexperienced, more concerned about hiring her friends rather than placing a qualified individual. Excellent place to work, fun environment, possible to advance, just get the right manager."
good,Nothing to discuss. Everyone has there own experiences. Thank you  put God first above everything. Stay loyal and committed. Keep a smile on your face. When you smile the world will smile with you.
good,Fine I’d you don’t mind min wage. Manager excellent co worker fine customers nice too. Was easy job if you did your job right. Good place in the north port store
good,"Dollar Tree is very fast paced,very physically demanding position."
good,Great place to work if you're looking for something part-time. Good for college students or older people that can't work many hours. Not a job for someone on their own.
good,"I enjoyed working at Dollar tree i had an awesome boss very caring and understanding of his employers, he appreciated us and it showed. A typical day at work was all ways busy with cashing out customers item returns or re-shops. The hardest part of the job getting customers to understand that we give no cash back just exchanges. The post enjoyable part is working with people because i enjoy that."
good,Management wasn't treated fairly pay wasn't great with the responsibility they give you the customers was rude everyday need to hire more people for a effective and productive team
good,"I love working here, its fun, easy, i like the people i work with, but i need a full time job!Every saturday we get truck, and unloading it maakes you carry heavy stuff."
good,Working for Dollar Tree wasn't that bad. I enjoyed the associates that I managed and the work that we did together daily.
good,"Coming into work by noon and ringing up the customers. If we were slow we'd stock shelves at the same time. I learned to remember the aisles by heart, just in case the customers ask for assistance. My managers were pretty decent. The hardest part of the job was coming back into work at 11pm til 6am just to stock the shelves. Your body becomes drained when you dont have any sleep. I enjoyed seeing the same customers weekly and getting to know them by name."
good,I was seasonal but learned alot. I set up displays and stocked new items every day. The managers and co-workers were friendly and helpful as well
good,"Unloaded merchandise from trucks, stocked shelves, inventoried"
good,"management in uper level need improvment  , need more attention to thier team needs ,listens, understand and think about futures."
good,They only pay minimum wage for all the work that you do and it's not worth it management is ok but can be very difficult at times customers is really rude
good,I'm a very good and hard worker....always on time never call out.. I just want a job that values  an hard working  employee. I would be an good fit at your company
good,It was a great experience  working  for that company  .i learned  alot helped a lot of people  .made a lot of new  friends. My boss was fair .sometimes  he give me extra hours.
good,"Orangeville....Great place to work. Very supportive and friendly staff. Scheduling done to meet needs. Chances of advancement are good. learned many things within first few weeks about management."
good,Just need changing within the DM. Company should pay more attention to the SM needs due to them being in the store and know what actually happens with the DM compared to the DM  making false staeo
good,a typical day at work is clocking in and standing at the register checking people out the store. When the store is fairly empty we must take the items that were wrongly placed throughout the store and put them where they are supposed to be. We also had to bring the inventory from the back and set it in the aisles where its supposed to be.
good,"Personally I didn't find Dollar tree providing enough money and the teamwork was out of control there. People were constantly on there phones, listening to music and when I needed backup no one would come for at least 15 minutes and then the customers would get annoyed which I tried to diffuse any situation that could have ended poorly. Overall Dollar tree is definitely a beginners job but it was definitely a job that I would never forget because it was my very first job."
good,"Low wages, no advancements and not enough hours to work. It was great having the pleasure to interact with customers and bring them a smile."
good,"Supervised team members helped customer with certain issues, learned that productivity is a very strong factor, getting extra work done was the most enjoyable part of the day, hardest part of the job not having enough payroll and having staff that constantly called out and that upper and the management team rarely helped to resolve important issues."
good,The job is very hard because i dont have help i need to get the job  done also the store manager takes my over time from me and pays me the hours in regular pay i also have to work off the clock after i clock out for lunch or go home i only get ten breaks not 15 min breaks.
good,Working for Dollar Tree was acceptable when I was in high school and in college but it does not suite my needs as an adult. It is only part time and pays minimum wage. It does not offer benefits and the schedule is not flexible. I work mostly weekends and nights which secludes me from my family and friends. The people who work at the store is what makes it worth it. They feel more like a family then co-workers.
good,a good company to work for with a good team but they can improve in some area and not making people feel like they are less important that the full time employees not  making one employee feel like they are shut out cause the only work four to five hours
good,I had a great experience working at Dollar tree it was good days and bad days but overall I still had great customer service bc interacting with different cultures was nice and I always made the customers wanted to come back and shop no matter what im a people person but I just had to move on to something better
good,"Good experience, good job, acceptable coworkers, fun place to shop as and work, learn lots of new things, meet lots of interesting people, good work environment"
good,"I did stocking."
good,I think it's a great place to work and be able to move up and advance into other opportunities there. Management and other employees become like a family there and they are willing to work with your home schedule
good,I enjoyed working at Dollar Tree. My co-workers and the assistant managers were like family to me and a lot of the customers were super nice. The store had a little bit of cleanliness issues but overall the store was organized. The problem with the store was the Store Manager because she would make smart remarks about customers and employees. The Store Manager also didn't care about her employees health if they didn't feel well at work.
good,Working at dollar tree has been a great experience because I have learn to work with different types of issues that happened at a retail store I learned to keep my cool and as much as I want to control what happens I can put myself and other in danger. I've learned to be patient with customers and try to help them as much as possible. It all depends in the area that you work in some areas are easy and manageable others can be hard and difficult to work with I personally think that every Dollar Tree should have security for the sake of the employees and customers we aren't able to handle all the customers at times specially when they can harm the employee or customers.
good,"It's part time retail, nothing glamorous, nothing particularly special. However, it a very supportive place to work. The management always tries to accommodate one's personal schedule."
good,It sucks if your dm doesn’t like you. Will not move to Hogher volume store or chance to grow. Other than that it is fast passes and stressful if you have a brand new family at home 6 day work weeks during fourth quarter. Okay not bad but time to move on when you grow tired of the bull.
good,I really like working there I like the people and co workers. I work there as a second job. I really like the customers. My manager and I get along really well.
good,It fun to work at sometimes when it's slow I stock product on aisle I stock candy and I also do impulse well I'm checking and do go back and face aisles when it's slow
good,Not much to do just stock shelves and unload trucks with merchandise in them and do your job that's pretty much what it is oh wear anything but blue jeans
good,This job as a cashier you only get paid 7.35$ an hour! It's not an ideal job if you have bills to pay! It's good for a second job if you have a primary job..
good,This was a new store setup. Once the product was stocked on shelves the job was over. The position included putting shelves together. Light cleaning was also involved.
good,I was in an accident and had to be out of work 3 months. I kept in contact with them the whole time. Once I received my doctors release they inform me I can only come back as cashier.
good,Just be prepared to work and keep a smile . Be willing to work as a team . Be a flexible worker and please customers. I think you should get more hours
good,i enjoyed working for dollar tree manangement were proffessional and also understanding. Staff members were very helpful when needed. Great place for work
good,"A typical day at work for me was, customer service, and restocking shelves. The only thing that I had to learn was the buttons on the cash register, everything else I had already known because I had worked in retail before. Management and the culture of the place was very poor. There was nothing hard about the job at all, and the most enjoyable part of the job was being able to meet and talk to different people."
good,Be able to multitask. Will be standing on feet so wear supportive shoes. Bring snacks or have snack in mind because breaks are very fast! Overall it’s a good place to work. They only offer part time unless you’re management.
good,"People People. The employees at Dollar Tree understood Customer Service to the Max. Service is number one. Whatever time of the year, Holidays, Legal Holidays, and other, it did not matter. When work was available you could work. Good atmosphere and great training."
good,"Working for Dollar Tree wasn't all that bad but the hour suck and for some people to be full time employee's they were barely giving them part time hour and the pay that they pay their employee's is not even worth you getting up for and dealing with what you have to deal with. And, on top of that Dollar Tree is a high volume store where a lot of steal all day long and they have no security. Its sad cause everything in the store is either 2 for a $1.00 or a $1.00 each."
good,I would recommend working for dollar tree if you are not working at the carroll island middle river position. I already knew the system from working at dollar tree in westminster md which was a great place to work.
good,I enjoyed the customers. And I was very good at my work whether it was assisting customers with their needs or help. Worked in a neat and timely maner.
good,Company is a good job but they work you to hard for the amount they pay you management are very rude but employees were great to work with. Other then that I don't have that much to complain about
good,"I wanted to try a new career change and thought I might be interested going into the retail business."
good,"I liked the environment. Everyone was real friendly and nice, kind heart, and caring. We were like a family in there. Team work. Day by day the job was exciting. I meet great people."
good,Estollia is a person who only does for her own kind. When she came everyone wanted to leave. She didn't speak English and nor did she have much management experience
good,"i was able to meet new people every day and regular customers who kpet coming back to visit us. "
good,"Co-workers are nice & helpful. Its a easy job, helping customers find what they need, cashing them out, keeping store clean, answering phones and making sure your area is clean before clocking out. This is not a Job I would want to move up in but it is a good experience."
good,the co-workers was very nice it was a part-time job i was a cashier at this job i learned to make the the people smlime.
good,I work my butt off for minimum wage and not very good benefits but the employees are nice and the store is clean.
good,I would ring people up when I worked on register. Keep my area clean and put back returns.
good,"cashier, customer service, greet customers, stock, face and front, clean, process returns, process coupons."
good,"A typical day at work starts when you clock in, then you have to take items back to the aisles to which they belong, while keeping the line down, then you have to stock items and recover any misplaced items, keeping the line down and assisting any customers. At the end of the day you have count down your draw clean and restock the pop cooler. "
good,everyday at work we work hard to get freight out and wait on our customers to make sure we offer the best customer service we can 
good,i learned a little bit of the retail multimillion dollar company but still in need to lean more.
good,At work I assisted customers with any inqueries they may have. I helped them find all merchandise they needed. I performed all duties required with a register. The co-workers were friendly and hard working as well.
good,Miss the company had great coworkers. managers let us work with them at end of day got to learn hands of with deposits and balancing out monies. the bad part was parents just letting their kids make a big mess of the toy area while they shopped.
good,Working at the Dollar Tree was fun until I had to do the same thing over and over again. It was way to reppetitive and it got boring. The management was amazing and everyone got along great. One problem they have is you don't get enough hours. I only got to work five hours in a day and got very little pay for the amount of effort I put in. Worked there for 2 years and got a 10 cent raise at most.
good,I love my job because it has flexible hours and the only thing that isn’t working out is my pay 7:35 for a large corporation? I don’t think so. What I like is the vibe I give to people when they come into the store
good,Enjoyed working at the store. Met great employees and customers.Pay is low. But will schedule you for part time hours as needed. Turn over is high but people that want to have a part time I encourage to apply.
good,Working at the Dollar Tree started off just a part time job while I relocated to TN then I transferred back to Indiana it was to be without a job. I loved the people I worked with just didn’t pay enough to survive with kids. I needed more hours and more pay. But a great place to work.
good,"Not too bad if you just want a job to keep some change in your pocket, but only if you have another job as well. The one I worked at in Wichita KS was clean and had some cool items."
good,Dollar tree is a very easy job it's just frustrating . Nobody stocks the shelfs correctly so when it's my turn I'm Sticking for five hours straight because I have to organize before restocking the shelfs .
good,Overall it well pleasant working there. I would recommend this job to anyone and i would go back just would have to pay way more. Their pay isnt the best especially for the cost of living now days anyways and they dont give alot of hours..nomore than 25 hours a week..besides that it is a great job.
good,"I provide excellent service to the customers.  I enjoy my job duties.  I offer to assist in stocking shelves, merchandise displays, front office duties.  And any other job duties assigned."
good,It was an Okay job. They wanted to much from me with no raises. I was pushed in mtg. An really didn't want it. The mtg then wasn't very nice to costumers an employees. She ran off a lot of good employees..they now have a new mrg.
good,The job itself was pretty cool. Some times you might get a crazy customer or two depending on what area you work in. I would work there again in the right area.
good,i enjoyed the work i did and i loved all the customers and my coworkers. Decent hours. I loved organizing the shelves and setting up displays. We always had a theme for every time of year and holiday
good,"It’s fun to work at Dollar tree, flexible hours , no stress, co-operative co-workers. My exceptable salary per hrs is $ 10:00. Due to this reason I am looking for another job."
good,working at dollar tree you have to have a lot of patients dealing with the customers. a typical work day would consist of cleaning and stocking. I learned to have patients
good,"It’s a fun experience depending on the shift manager sometimes your stocking shelves, cashier, cleaning aisles, blowing up balloons or putting throwbacks back onto the shelf"
good,Was a cashier and had to unload trucks and put freight out in a timely manner helped customers with getting their merchandise fast and quickly out of the store
good,"Pay wasn't that great the hours were't amazing but the manager i had would always work with you if you needed the day off to take care of things she would help you with it,"
good,not a good place. I really hated it a lot. I would never walk in a dollar tree store never again . rude customer & from 1 - 10 I would rate dollar tree A BIG FAT 0 .
good,"Good part time job to get u by, no benefits, it's the people that you don't want to work with, the manager, forget his name was stealing and still was working there, no room for advancement"
good,"Great place to work if you are a student are need a flexible schedule. The Manager Trish is a great person and a good boss.. The rest of the employees are really caught up in a game of cut throat, pretty childish stunts and drama is a constant part of the atmosphere."
good,"Very fun place to work, I am a cashier and stocker at the moment. The employees are friendly and I enjoy working with customers. I need more hours but my boss said they are maxed on hours."
good,"A typical day at work involved checking out people, sorting go backs, cleaning, taking out trash, sweeping..."
good,"Personally, I loved working at Dollar Tree and gave my absolute best into every day I gave them. Dollar Tree is a humbling place where you can learn more about your community and what/ who comes out of it. It has a more down to earth vibe."
good,Well the job let me use my creative experience when wanting to sell items. The management was not mean. It wasn't especially strenuous. The people did not complain too much. yeah! overall it was a good job it just did not pay much. And the checks were delivered !
good,This Job isnt recommended for any full time (or even part-time in some periods of the year) unless you work your way up to Assistant Manager. Very easy Job; There's nothing difficult.
good,the most enjoyable part is that I can come in when I want but the management is very horrible . I learn how to appropriately stock.
good,The Store was a great store but the managers really didn't take the job as serious as they could have. the job is fairly easy task.
good,Wonderful place for seniors in highschool or freshman in high school to make money they provide you with the extra hours needed
good,A typical day at work was work. Helping customers and running a register and stocking shelves was the most part of a shift unless you were closing then you just add cleaning. I learned how to do the job of the managers and how to deal with customers. The management was ok depending on location but in all no complaints. My co-workers were mostly female and were all really nice. The hardest part of the job was cleaning up after other co-workers after their shifts and also trying to get everything else done that you are supposed to be doing on your shift. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning new things. Most of the time the people I worked with were really nice. The district manager I had was amazing and was easy to talk to.
good,this way a fun place to work. Everyhing is a dollar. I learned how  to do Point of Sales.
good,i liked this job as a cashier but managing the place didn't look as good as other jobs would.
good,Easiest job I ever held. Management was ok but dont get your hopes up on actually keeping a job with this company.
good,"Depending on the day and month, its typically busy, Always doing something different from processing freight to ringing on the register"
good,"Good place to work overall , the job is great and very calm Job but management is poor but maybe the manager will leave but everything else is great and I recommend."
good,"This was my first job and it really worked around my school schedule. Managers were always good to me. This was a very busy location though, being calm but fast and efficient was key."
good,I enjoyed this job I just didn't get enough hours as I wanted to.I worked about 5 hours everyday. And I enjoyed them team I worked with was decent I really dont have many complaints.
good,"I come to work ready to work and get my night started. I have great customers. I have learned so much from working here at the dollar tree from closing at night to help to stock the shelves to keep the store clean and organized. I have worked with some cool managers."
good,"The manager and other employees were very nice! There is a dress code. No jeans. Very low pay. If they paid at least $10, I'd Iove to work there. Dusty."
good,Fast paced Sometimes it can be very slow but sometimes you get long lines  asked for back up but overall it's a good job to start off with and most stores have great people in it
good,Was easy work and didn't require much training. The pay is not too good but for the amount of work you're actually doing I would say its fair. The customers make it a fun place to work and not to mention its a great place to bargain shop.
good,I would still be there if my life hadn't went array. It was fun face paced and a joy. Manager was cool and so was staff. Every thing was easy peas and I truely loved it.
good,"To be honest the management position at this particular company is very racist and she should never be able to manage anybody, but overall its a place to make some quick money."
good,Overall great place to work just not enough hours a week to make ends meet training is pretty simple because you do all your training in about a day in the only thing you need not really know how to do is count money
good,"The manager is Awesome, The store was fun at remodel but job didn't last very long as they expected which was bad for us employees that got laid off after a week."
good,This job I work for is productive on the sales that are made each day at work.  what I like about this job is checking out the people and making sure that they find what they are looking for. there really isn't anything hard about this job all there is to be done is stock the merchandise and check out people at the register.
good,"Order Selection"
good,This is for fresh out of highschool. The workers are always so helpful. This is perfect for someone with no experience. I worked in haygood shopping center and i meet plenty if good souls there.
good,"Had a good experience with Dollar Tree, job was good, and got to really know the customer. The hours were pretty good and hours are normally pretty normal."
good,Working for Dollar tree is manual labor it is fun around the customers especially around season holidays when everything's a Dollar always beautiful people and never a problem it was nice working there...
good,Once enjoyed working there because of the actions of a store manager it has become unprofessional. No communication no respect employee's get mistreated in front of costumers theres alot to say this is just a hint of the worst unprofessional store manager i have ever work/ed for
good,"I stocked shelves 20-30 hours a week unloaded the truck 2 days of the week very tedious work hard labor lots of products to be put away. But not fair with the pay, 7.25 is absolutely not Ohkay with me to stock shelves for 5-6 hrs a day."
good,Pleasant work environment.  Enjoyable employees and customers.  The head manager and assistant managers were highly trained and easy to work for and talk to.
good,I love this store if i could go back ill probably would. This job didn't long for me because the the distant i have to go .very easy place  to work at for a first job
good,The store is constantly busy and  it's allot of work to keep clean and stocked but I love my coworkers and management everyone sticks together and does their part makes it easier .I guess you can say that's why I love the job so much .
good,"Dollar Tree, was a great first job to work at especially since I was still attending school when I first started working. It taught me how to work in a fast paced job and how to handle situations calmly and collectively."
good,Lack of pay make people loose interest or for more money else where. That’s what I’m doing but the place is very opening and welcoming but for the work it’s not worth the pay.
good,"I liked working at Dollar Tree but the pay wasn't enough and every time I got a raise,  minimum wage would go up and the raise wouldn't carry over.  The result was me making the same amount as a new hire despite being there for five years- at this point longer than anyone else at my location. Additionally one of the new higher-ups has instructed the management to ignore the scheduling needa of the employees and leave the schedule up to the computer, which may end up leaving employees with less than 15 hours a week."
good,"I truely loved my team! they made the job a great place to work, the pay and the hours aren't enough money to live and the advancement oppertunities are limited."
good,Dollar tree is definitely a good place to get some work history if you don't have any. It's very easy. If their pay was higher and there was room for growth I would go back
good,fast paced environment but management needs a lot of work. was not getting a day off on a weekend but other managers were. very discrimative. did not always get 40 hours. sometimes only 32. the most enjoyable was working with customers and paperwork.
good,I can easily balance my life with work. Never did I find having a job difficult. I enjoy helping customers and giving them the information that they're looking for. My working experiences has taught me how to be outgoing and useful!
good,some days could be fast pace and some slow pace.how to work with other and learning all the ropes.Enjoying the getting to know you'r customers .management good for the place.
good,it didn't pay well but i learned a lot and met a lot of wonderful people but it was time for a change . they need better organization and management but it was ok.
good,"Dollar Tree is a fun place to work, when you have the right management. The only thing I had an issue with, was when we had a switch of management and they didn't like how I worked, and I was pretty much running the store by myself, as a Cashier and Stock employee, until we got another Store Manager. I was taken off Cashiering to be put only on Stock, then ended up losing my job over an incident that I didn't have anything to do with."
good,"Overall the Dollar Tree Stores is a good place, to work.  When the store manager is not a good one in the store; however, it can make for a miserable place to work."
good,Had great co-workers which made the job much better. Pay wasn’t the best. Not much room for advancement and raises were non existant. Would have kept job but I decided to move back home.
good,A typical day for me is I am a closer I work 5;30pm to 10.30pm. To me it is usually a normal night . I do what I usually do every night. I have learned to be more patient with people. The main manager is great he is awesome fun to work with. Also the assistant manager is good too. To me the hardest part of the job is when your day starts out not good it seems I take it out on everybody else. I enjoy my customers.
good,"Great place to work,fast paced yet enjoyable working with the public.Management was good.no hard parts to the job.Most enjoyable working with the public and seeing customers happy."
good,"Only worked through holidays "
good,"It was a fun job , I like to work with other people , I learned allot about dish washing and stocking , I just want to work and make my money , and every body else job easier"
good,i loved my job until i transferred to another location i had noticed my store manager loading her truck up with donated goods that were for charity i reported this to the district manager and they did nothing so i looked for other employment because i didnt want to work for a place that allowed that
good,"I was a stocker first when I was immediately hired helped the store open up. Because it wasn't here prior. I helped build the store up on the inside. I than became the cashier, that was a fun part of the job because I got to help each customer that passed through my line. But I wanted to do more. I was asked to do gift baskets for the store that people could purchase as a whole. I ended up making those as well as cashiering. Working with people is the most enjoyable part of any job. I loved interacting with the customers and helping them out the best I could. I do recall be the only cashier cashiering the day before Easter in 2006, and I grossed 20k for the store me solely. It felt good."
good,Was a great company felt like a family. We had perfect balance  amongst our team. We worked as a group and got our task done. There was more of a family bond between the team wich made it easier to work together and in return it taught me working together u can achieve anything with help.
good,We pretty much gutted the inside of the store.  Skilled laborers came in and put new flooring and painted.  We moved the shelves and replaced the merchandise.
good,"I really enjoy my job-meeting new people,helping when and where I can. My managers and co-workers are friendly and help out when or if I need it. I like to think that I have an open face so people feel comfortable approaching me for anything."
good,"Great starter job for a teenager, however there is no room for advancement.  I like the atmosphere at the Dollar Tree because there was always something to do."
good,It's was a very easy job. I'm very friendly. Helped put things up. Helped move things with stockers. Helped other cashiers. Has helped close and open before.
good,Everyone works as a team. We all multitask. If one needs help we jump in and help. Customer service is important and having a good attitude is imperative and we all try to keep smiling and joking as to keep the everyone positive.
good,It's was okay but it didn't fit me  great for shopping but I wouldn't work there again I would stick shells and then organize the shells and then people would come and mess it all up
good,The manager was unfair and favored certain individuals. The time off requested was usually granted. The atmosphere was acceptable and the work we did should of been worth more then paid
good,"management was very understanding, when I was going to leave my previous employer, I was given extra hours.My customers were saddened when I left"
good,"I worked the stock shift which was good. Go in at 5 a.m. and get off at 10 a.m. then on Saturday come it to unload the truck. The hours were not that great, only about 20 to 25 if it was not a holiday."
good,"A day at work was usually pretty easy going. At certain times of the year (Summer, Holidays, etc.) it is very fast pace and physically demanding. This was my first job, right out of high school, so I didn't have any job experience, this was a great first job. Getting to know the people and assisting people was always a great part of my day. Co-Workers were always willing to help you out and would go out of there way to make sure the front ran smoothly and the lines didn't get backed up. The hardest part of this job was trying to keep it stocked plus making sure the line didn't get backed up. It was hard trying to watch the line plus getting all my merchandise stocked up. The most enojoyable part was getting to meet new people and being able to learn about peoples lives. It was a real eye opener to see how different peoples lives really are."
good,"A very good place to work, very freindly atmosphere. Longest job ive held, I learned that many people behave certain ways when in a rush."
good,"love working here get to meet so many people on a day to day basis. I think  dollar tree is  a pretty good company, i enjoy the customers and our staff."
good,all in all I loved working for this company n my Boss was very nice n polite. Clean n stocked every day. Was close to home n learned a lot of different stuff in short period of time .
good,"I enjoyed the work, because, I was always busy, and, I like to meet new people."
good,a typical day at work was always busy. it was my first job. the hardest part of my job was multi tasking
good,A typical day at work I was a cashier made small talk with the customers as I rung up their items.Management was probably the hardest to deal with but the co workers were very friendly. The job was fairly easy. The hardest part was dealing with unhappy customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was being in a fun work environment.
good,"A typical day at work consists of a lot of communication between myself and the customers. It's a very team-based work environment and with the right people there is really not a lot of stress on the job. We all do our part to make it easier on each-other. The management that I've worked with in the past two years has been very understanding and pushes me to better myself no matter the direction I decide to take. I don't think this job is hard to keep up with, it's very laid back and as I've said, perfect for a first job or someone new to the workplace. I do however have to say just like any other retail job, the hardest time to keep up is during holidays. The busiest days can be somewhat hard to keep up with if you aren't used to fast pace environments and it can get a little overwhelming when there aren't enough staff working on register. Set that aside, it's a great job and I think the best part of working there has to be all of the regular customers that we have in the store. I've spent two years at the store I'm in now and I know most of the regulars on a first-name basis and they're always asking how I am. It makes me feel welcome, and excited to go into work."
good,When i would get to work i would always fine something to do because i never liked to just be standing there and not do anything i would get bored if i was not doing anything.I always like to be on time to work i was never late all my co-workers were very nice to some of them taught me how count money how to stock.The hardest part of my job was when i first got there i didn't really new how to count money and at the end of the shift if i was the one closing i had to count the deposit money and i didn't know how to shut down the registers.The most enjoyable part about my job is that i got to meet people everyday and got to help them!
good,"I had to deal with horrid customers and horrible hours. `unfair hours include working one day a week for x amount of hours, which was not enough for me to really support myself."
good,"overall good job"
good,i would work for this employer again even though there are no medical benefits and are part time only positions
good,"Help and assist customers throughout work shift. Finalize all transactions, answer phones calls, provide proper information to customers."
good,"I enjoy working at Dollar Tree.  It's a great place that has many new items weekly.  Great place to shop on a budget.  Co-workers get along really well. The hardest part of the job not getting enough hours.  Typical 10-15 hour weekly.  I most enjoy the fact that when customers leave with a smile, I have do a good job."
good,Dollar Tree is a great place to work but it is only part-time with no benefits
good,"As a cashier I enjoyed my job. When I became an assistant manager I was not given the training for certain task in some areas such as important computer task, but I realize I was just part time but it was an important job. I enjoyed working for Dollar Tree, but I only work part time. When I opened with one cashier we got there 30 minutes early and made the night before deposit riding in separate cars for safety reasons. I had to go to the bank inside Walmart to get change for the day and toward the end of the shift for closing shift. I checked emails, stock merchandise, ordered merchandise, and done counts on a print out sheet on certain merchandise than came from home office. I also counted down safe to make sure all money was accounted for and did cash register readings through out my shift. When I work closing shift at the beginning of my shift at 3 pm I counted down the safe to make sure there was no shortage from previous shift, check emails from home office, stock merchandise, counted down safe throughout my shift and register readings. Customer assistants, unload truck. and started cleaning up store at 7pm and straightening shelves to make the store presentable for next day. I had to count down my register and print out my shift read out to make sure all cash was accurate. Then I locked up and cashed out the cashiers register and readings to make sure all reading was accurate. I gathered all money that was taking in for the whole day from all shifts and totaled it to match the deposit on the computers deposit. Gathered all paper work made out deposit slip and bagged it"
good,"Alright company, needs better pay and benefits, should provide better hours as well."
good,A typical day in the job was greeting everyone who walked into our store with a smile. The crew was very welcoming and helped me when I needed it. Management at the time was very helpful as well with teaching me what I needed to know in a good amount of time.
good,"To much going on there, it's Black Friday everyday. The job was ok, it could be tough, but for the most part you were treated fair. The pay was not the best for all the things that needed to be done"
good,I really enjoyed my job as cashier. I enjoyed working with and helping the customers. Im glad the store is under new management cause now it just seems so much neater and shelves are stocked. Good job .
good,i work for dollar tree I will not review not trying to be  terminated if this is posted. Jobseekers need to decide for themselves. When applying for any job. This is my own opinion.
good,Good job just need better pay and organizations and better managers and they dont recognize the work you put in buy the coworkers were funny and helpful not all the managers were bad
good,"It was a good job until the district manager started letting workers go, they said they didn't need any reason to fire you they could let you go for any reason they wanted"
good,It went pretty good company to work for everything in there with cheap and good quality I'm back at the management they were pretty cool it was just a good vibe good environment
good,I had an overall great experience working at dollar tree. I just dislike the fact that the hiring manager was playing favoritism and was listening to other employees under her.
good,"When I was working for Dollar tree it was always me and another assistant manager on duty. When I come in and were to be over the safe. The other manager would go in the safe without me knowing then when money comes up missing they blamed me. When they claim they roll the camera back they couldn't see nothing. But they always wanted me to replace the money when I got paid, saying I was going to get fired by they company if I didn't. Just be aware of your so call bosses."
good,Working as a student in dollar I was given many roles. I acted as cashier and also stocked the store. Dollar Tree was a great first consistent job experience.
good,"Dollar Tree was a fast pace environment that was a very rewarding experience.  I worked approximately 5 hours per day, 5 days a week. I really enjoyed the interaction with the customers."
good,"Besides having experience prior to the job I only make 7.45 an hour. My management team is amazing, as well as my coworkers. Holidays make it stressful."
good,A typical day is running the cash register and walking back and forth through the store to stocked shelf's and put everything back were it goes. it's a great job if you love to constantly be on the move or have to stand in the same sport for 10 minutes or more at a time.
good,"Enjoyed the people, awesome work  environment, everything a dollar, just wish I got paid more then what I was being paid. I learned quick and able to work whenever called in to work."
good,"Dollar tree is a community cheap store that everyone likes!"
good,"*A typical day at work could be anything to slow to busy, just depends on the time of day it is *I learned that as long as you work hard you can achieve anything *Management could be both easy and hard but its all about the energy you bring to the table *The hardest part of the job is when you are dealing with a rude customer"
good,"Normally, for me a typical at Dollar Tree includes greeting the customers, assisting them in any way I can. As an employee, I have to make sure the store remains clean. Working at Dollar Tree, I learn to help customers that speak another language find what they need. I enjoy speaking with older customers asking them how they are doing because you never know what someone is going through."
good,Greet customers with hello welcome to dollar tree. Learned store layout returning products to sales floor. I worked with some exciting people. I truly enjoy helping people find the things they need.
good,It was extra work with Christmas holiday so close and was easy to work with school schedules and with all the kiddos letting out for the holiday and new years around the corner
good,You are given a chance to learn and progress everyday. Also you are challenged in bettering yourself. You are given chances to fully run a full staff on your own as well as a store on your own. You are given space to make decisions based on your best ability.
good,"as long as you are willing to work this is a nice relaxed place to work. most of the people are friendly but there is hardly any chance of advancement and the shifts are only five hours long,"
good,"I learned alot about retail here it was my first retail job "
good,"open or close store. Count the safe and cash register drawers. Stock shelves. Clean my area , and different areas in the store. Train new cashiers. Make bank deposits."
good,I enjoy my position but more hours is needed to perform the job that is required to maintain a perfect score in this store. I feel that my face pace helps customers continue to shop with us and my organization skills are well recognized as well as appreciated.
good,"Most people dont help, the pay sucks, if you are part time you will be lucky to get 15+ hours in a week, most people quit, the turn over rate is very high"
good,"Just a bit upset at the ""younger crowd"" who failed to apply themselves in accordance with instruction."
good,Dollar is a fairly nice place to work at. I would highly recommend working there. It is good work experience too if it's your first job. You also don't have to worry about fake money because the managers check it themselves.
good,Unloading stock ; stock shelves with products;i learned how to do a reset for new product. Both managers were helpful and hard working.it felt like a family working together.some people would go thru the store and knock things off the shelves purposely.The best was meeting all the incredible good people who shopped there
good,"learn to work with problem solving "
good,My work day consisted of standing at the cash register for 6 or 7 hours at a time and checking the customers out. The days were very fast and non stop .
good,"I was a stock at Dollar Tree and sometimes whenever they needed me an cashier. Regular employee none manager get 5 hour shifts. Within those 5 hours they want you to get 125 or more boxes stocked out before your shift is over. In other words, 25 boxes an hour, if not you are not meeting the requirements. Between those 5 hour shift unless your manager asks you to stay (optional) you only get an 10 minute break."
good,i like shopping at dollar tree is great but actually working there was stressful no hours were given out and the pay even with experience was still unfair
good,This is a relaxed and balanced work environment. The management team is wonderful. They have flexible hours. I would recommend to anyone seeking part time employment.
good,Management was very poor. Pay was not that great. couldn't get fulltime hours. Manager and assist manager was very rude. Cashiers did all the work. Poor communication
good,Could have made a better decision on the store manager. She is too young and immature to run the store properly. Pay and compensation could be alot better for the job that is required from you.
good,"My review for this job is also great because everyone knew everyone and there was always team work and everyone was very respectful except for the manager , the manager was okay at times but not like everyone else , but also she was very fun to e around even if the manager was in the mood for fun just all work ,we did not have security everyone as the security at the time and no benefits at all."
good,"The hardest part of the job was unloading the truck because sometimes the truck drive will come late or too early. When the driver would unload it the boxes would be smashed, so we had to look in them to make sure the items were not damaged. Its makes it hard to stack also with the boxes damage. Especially for the chemicals, if it was leaking, That was never good!"
good,The experience here was great met a lot of people and a lot of new things and got myself used to dealing with people I'm working with people in that type of alarm
good,"It was a great job, i can say that it could easily be someone's first job. The position as a cashier is not that hard, the only challenging moment would  have to be certain costumers. Just have a tough moment, or give the issue to a manager. I truly believe anyone can so this job. I enjoyed it for over a year."
good,It was a fun easy job and I will definitely consider someone to Work there. Good and decent hours . Also good pay . Nice environment to be around
good,I would like to advance in a Management position. Dollar Tree is a great place to work. Have good people to work with. You meet great customers. Management is good.  I like working at the Dollar tree.
good,Liked the company just not enough pay or benefits . Cashiers are only part time positions at 8.75 hr. while management is full time at 9.50 to 10.00 hr.
good,I like my job  i do cashier answer the phone and greet are customers as they walk in . I also have day were i help with stocking merchandise and unload truck when we get are merchandise in . I'm  Always willing to learn something new.  I want  to better myself  as well to  progress in life.
good,Good friendly fast and convenient. I like working there the managers are friendly but not enough employees in one shift and not enough hours are given.
good,i had to stock and re stock shelves also keepo store clean also clean bathroom and cashier area keep back house clean keep stock area low pack shelves out
good,"While I worked as a cashier at dollar tree, sometimes the work was boring on slow days, but I had the best manager. She was amazing she knew how to keep the job interesting and fun. When standing at a register for hours, your feet and back get sore and tired, but she made sure in the slow moments to keep you busy and focused on something else. The job itself was a decent and ok job but the manager I had made it a great experience"
good,Well I stock the selves I also unload the freight. I work the cash register. I make my announcements over the PA. Organize the stock room.
good,"a day at dollar tree can be hard and trying sometimes if you let the customers get to you .. but me I always keep a smile on my face and everybody love to come in my line, I made sure no one waited to long and if there was a problem I made sure I talked through the problem with what I know"
good,"dollar tree its easy its a regular part time job cant really say much about it . the employees are friendly, the manager is firm he makes sure his store is running in a great manner ."
good,I really enjoy working for Dollar Tree. I am currently looking for a second job or a full time job due to the lack of hours available at Dollar tree.
good,It is always busy and there is always something to do at the job. There is always something new to do and always new product to see.
good,"I loved working for Dollar Tree. It helped me learn a lot of my skills I have now. The management was very professional and the other employees were very nice. We all were truly an dollar tree family. The downfall was it was only part time so I wasn't eligible for the benefits so I quit to look for a full time position. I got to fill balloon orders, help with customers pick out gift baskets, also helped unload the truck and stock the shelves."
good,"The provided a great work experience, great coworkers, nice boss, easy fun atmosphere. A typical day at work consist greeting customers, ringing up merchandises on a register, cleaning my work environment, put away merchandise, but my main goal is to please the customers."
good,Management with this company isn't to bad. I wouldn't recommend anything below since their part time workers get about 15 hpw...
good,"Nice paced, but no room for advancement. Nice place to work for if nothing much else is going on in your life."
good,I'd clock in and stay at the register unless we were slow then I'd stock until they needed help at the front.
good,"customer service, stocking, cashier, part time only, only 5 hours a day no benefits,"
good,"Typical day at work was busy, I learned cash handling skills and customer service, Management was not around much, co- workers were always nice, Hardest part was staying til midnight, Ennoyable part was going to work and ringing peoples items."
good,"I wish I could work there again. Awesome managers and co-workers, great hours. And just a better job."
good,"Performed Day to Day Operations,"
good,"A typical day for me at work, I would come in get things ready for my shift, start stocking the candy isle before we opened. When we opened I would run register, stock shelves, help if customers needed assistance. I learned that I can handle many things at one time, the management was great to work with we all got along very well, and co-workers were good. Only few did things. The hardest part of the job was when co-workers wouldn't do the things that they needed to have completed and I would have to do it. The most enjoyable part of the job was just getting to meet new people and interacting with the customers"
good,"if you like long hours , and plan to have no life outside of work , this is the place for you"
good,"Loved the job very much but position was only seasonal. It was challenging working retail at Christmas, but very rewarding.  Customers were in shopping moods and in general were very friendly and full of joy."

good,"Good place to work everyone friendly and hard workers "
good,"Dollar Tree is a great place to work,I reach for higher.I like to give myself a challenge,not to just be a cashier.Being a freight manager is sort of a challenge.However I want the whole package,to have my own store."
good,Good company to work for. Always understanding my scheduling that I need. Mangers are always helping out when I don’t understand something. Hardest part of the job is when the Hollidays are  coming up you have a non stop line.
good,Good company and work environment. About a normal Sales Associate work day. Good managers and professional work environment. Sometimes you are needed to help in other departments.
good,A very good place to work for people of all ages. Employees receive decent hours and the work is not too complicated or hard. The pay is alright an most customers are courteous
good,I liked my job with Dollar Tree but unfortunately was at a place in my life which disagreed with my career. I was able to promote quickly within the company because of the high-turn over rate but the employees and customers are ideal- if you select the correct locations.
good,Enjoyable job. Management and employees were good to work with/for. Worked a cashier drawer and also stocked products onto the floor. Worked at a couple locations.
good,"It's a good place to work, but the store manager makes it difficult to enjoy working there. The customer base is great. They make it worth working here."
good,When working here you have multiple job task to complete on your shift. Maintaining a clean and organized store is the main priority. Stocking is a must.
good,I enjoyed working there good steady place to work it was great!! I loved the environment one of the best jobs I ever had really the pay was awesome I was loving that

The customers are wonderful . It is a pleasure to go to work every day . My only wish is that they paid a little more to their employees .
good,The people who work there are nice kind and helpful and respectful  honest you stock the shelf and clean and put things together so u can have them really to be put on the shelves
good,Dollar Tree was a great place to work I really enjoyed my time working at the dollar tree. I was a great place to get away from the everyday stress for the house.
good,I hated working at dollar tree because people there was acting crazy in doing stuff regular people won't do people nor doinf they jobi didn't like working there
good,Nice job interview nice people nice manager clean and honest environment to work at give nice hours and have nice and friendly people that come and shop everyday
good,It was easily accessible because I was applying in the area and it was trial basis so there was some pressure I even worked with cabinets unloading and inflating balloons
good,It’s fun and I love the people I work with they are nice work with your schedule school if you’re a morning person also this  is a good job the benefits suck tho
good,"It was great working for the company.Worked with great staff, manager was great. Enjoyed working for the company, but I needed more pay so I got another job."
good,There was always a call out... this was my second job at the time so I was already a little sluggish and had to pull extra weight. Management let employers get away with breaking rules
good,"Working at Dollar tree you need to be quick on your feet, patient and able to work with difficult customers. Because it is such a big company but sells cheap things people take it for granted. Making it hard for employees to maintain the areas clean and organized."
good,Dollar Tree was cool a good job it showed me how to handle money and work on my customer service skills . I like the hours and the pay the co workers were respectful
good,A place where employee and customers come together to make it a happy place to be.  Greeting customers and hearing them say hello back.  hearing crafty ideas from the customers as they checked out.
good,"Great atmosphere, great people to work with, DM was very reliable and understandable in every aspect of my job. Very great place overall to work at. Would definitely love being part of the company again in the future possibly."
good,"This job wasn’t hard at all it was actually good . I learned a lot such as great  Communication with others , how to be more organized & stock things in the right areas"
good,I really didn’t like this job at all the place and everythin I wouldn’t recommend this job to anybody you rarely get hours and u rarely get recognize for your work
good,"Dollar Tree is a great company to work for, the shifts are nice and fast paced, the managers are really nice and notice you when you do good work and work hard. This job also helped me build the basic skills needed to be an efficient worker."
good,For the most part it was a good place to work at like to my employees and managers if I could go back to Dollar Tree and work with the same people and the same manager I go.
good,Worked at dollar tree for a year and was a good place to work at especially since the manager before the new manager came in gave flexible hours to those who had school/college. It benefit me because I was able to focus on school & be able to go to work for a few hours rather than a full shift unless I was asked to do so for extra hours which I didn't mind. The job was very easy going and the management before was great and super nice! Unfortunately dollar tree got a new manager at the location I was at and basically cut mine and some others hours which was unfair because I went from working about 20 hours per week to 8 hours per week. New management was very unprofessional and rude.
good,What do you get dollar tree was a fun experience you got to be a lot of demanding people that are coming out for all types of things and it’s just pretty much family store see a lot of friendly faces
good,I learned communication skills and how to be a team player. I learned how to do a five star endcap.how to rotate products .how to supervise employees and how to use my skills to my advantage.
good,The job was easy and fun to do I think to be honest one of the easiest jobs I had specially management I thought I was going to be stressful but it was really easy
good,It was a great job while I was in high school I wish I could have lasted but I moved on. Construction worker outside I loved it more great people great atmosphere
good,I have nothing to say I liked working for dollar tree I just had to quit because I got married. The people were very nice.pay was good I didn't get benefits tho
good,It was a little bit hard at first and then I got the hang of it and I got along very well with the employees there and I love working there and I I needed help I would ask them for help.
good,Family and community work. Strong relationships that can get you other jobs in other places. Your name will spread in your community good or bad. It's easy work.
good,That good was ok but it just wasnt for me....  I think u need for work at this job it speed and great multi tasking and understand you can  just say anything... But like i said it just wasnt for me
good,Dollar Tree was the best job I had .i would go back there if I could . Overall the work place was grate . They worker came to work on time .we had a go time at work it was like we where family.
good,A temporary job or side job to make extra cash. Friendly environment and reasonable pay .  Cashier scanning is easy but not something that everyone might like
good,"My experience at Dollar Tree was a very good experience. I learned how a small company can grow into a large company, while selling cheap items. I was fascinated by the structure of the business and / or the creative minds that was behind creating the company"
good,The job was good and the people were nice. I got to stock shelves and check out customers. The whole experience was nice. I would tell anyone that needed a secure job to try at Dollar Tree.

good,I was a great employee at dollar tree. Working there was not so hard it kept me busy and staying on my feet right before you knew it my shift was ended I loved it there
good,Dollar Tree was a very relaxed atmosphere.  The opening of the store was a bit stressful but the management did their best to make it fun for everyone.  After the store opened the relaxed atmosphere and encouragement from management continued even when the store was busy.
good,Dollar tree was a great workplace it had good pay overall it could have been better with the hours but in 2013 that was the best year for me because around Christmas time you get to see the laughter fun excitement moments helping people pick specific items for their loved ones and also seen enjoyment that the kids had seen all the Christmas stuff they had to offer and it only being 1$offerbeing$1 got a few of us
good,Great Work Experience For Anyone Who's Seeking A First Time Or Second Job Employment.. Fair Pay But You Also Have A Chance To Increase Your Work Experience

good,I would never work with them again They don’t pay you anything and they want you to do a lot I would not suggest anybody to work there my reason for leaving was it because of the pay
good,They have no trust in managers which they should knowing they have the keys to the store and stop being sceptical. Being untrustworthy is sad and never have someone work for you if there is no trust.
good,In general am looking to apply anywhere close to where I reside. And I feel dollar tree would make a great way to occupy myself. I love to work and i am desiring this job heavily.
good,nice place to shop if you're in a bind and need a things on a budget great people friendly and helpful most of the time store is clean and very well stocked
good,Work was good at first. I started around holiday season. I worked pretty much four to five hours daily. With the exception of having two days off. After the new year my hours got cut drastically. So I found new employment and gave my letter of resignation.
good,"Opening of the store prep for the day, stocking merchandise,  cashiers backup and helping customer to find of items that they are looking for. Taking daily deliveries."

good,ran register when not busy stocked front of store also assembled items to be put out on sales floor sometimes I worked overtime or was called to come to work
good,It was a good working environment overall. Dollar tree was good for me up until the time I graduated high school I then realized I wasn’t getting paid enough nor was I getting any good hours.
good,Frendly people nice area. Would recommend it for other people the management was good to work for and district manager was I little gruff but spoke his mind.
good,"Depending on the day and shift your working it sometimes gets super busy and then other times its dead and your day fills like it just dragging. You only work 4 to 5 hours a day but that might go up in the winter time for the Christmas season when its crazy busy all day and night. "
good,"If you are looking for a place to learn what your skills are in the customer service and retail area, Dollar Tree is a GREAT place to start!  "
good,"Easy enough. Everything is $1. Basic math skills, stocking, and organizing. Some stores are better than others. Seek out stores that are clean and well managed. They have an extremely high turn-over rate, at least for my area, so expect a lot of new faces."
good,I had a lot of fun working for dollar tree it was my first job it was very easy going lots to do if it wasn't busy. good managers great co workers. all around good

good,"Dollar Tree is fun and a nice place to work . The management is very helpful and nice . Working Part-Time fits in my schedule and I am happy with 13-18"

good,Dollar tree is a  great place to work for a close to my house for travel. They employees are nice and the management staff are easy to work with. Overall a nice company to work for
good,"Manager at the time was very nice , he was encouraging. I like working there so much I've tried to go back .After I had to leave. Do to an accident. Which caused me from walking at 100% . because of this , when I called to tell them I was ready to come back. They didnt have my job postion open  anymore .  which i understood but was upset because .I really loved working there . I never missed a day.  In all that time working there ... I have filled out applications to go back part-time . but NCB."
good,I like working there it’s a latex back kinda atmosphere every body is really friendly. I like the fact that everyone is treated fairly.they are always willing to accommodate to your needs. For doctors appointments or whatever else you need
good,Working at Dollar Tree is great. It helps build great customer service skills. I enjoy it. This job also makes you appreciate teamwork. At Dollar Tree we are a team
good,Working here was great it is a good company to work for. I really enjoyed being employed at the Dollar tree in Morgan hill the workers were great and so was the enviroment
good,dollar tree can be really crowded so u have to try and make each person happy while they wait the most enjoyable part to me is meeting new people and all the great things the store has to offer
good,My overall experience working there was fun. Everyone there was real easy going and helped me learn the stores routine. Its good pay if you are looking for something part-time.
good,"I love working at Dollar Tree. Managers are awesome and understanding within reason. They only hire part time. Friendly co-workers, fun setting and easy going atmosphere."
good,"The Dollar Tree was a great place to work. I was an Assistant Manager and did no get paid much but I tried to make a difference for the surrounding community. The Dollar Tree locally here has been in disarray (meaning, items were always on the floors needing to be picked up). I lost 40 lbs working there. Cheap way to get a gym pass."
good,Fast paced. No down time to get bored. always something to do. customers are great. management was ok. not too bad to work with. would gladly work for this company again.
good,"This is a job that could get picked up by someone who just graduated high school. Works around young people's schedules and yet, it teaches discipline."
good,Its a Great place to work. the management is awesome and I enjoy helping people.I clock in and either do cashier or stock and if I do stock I'm a back up cashier.
good,"Overall great place to work, Once you get to store management level they pay very well, unfortunately as a part time cashier or even full time Ops/Freight manager the pay is about 75 cents more then Min wage. Hours are very little as well for part time employees, easy job but not a walk in the park, as you get higher in management it does get more stressful as far as call ins you have to cover or Truck not ever showing up on time. But overall good place to work with many chances for advancement within the company."
good,Worked hard and advanced fast but pay increase either never happen or was so minimal it was not worth it.  I was an assistant manager for almost two years and stayed in the nine dollar range while other managers were brought in at fourteen for same work load.  All reviews were excellent but pay never really increased but demand sure did.
good,"Great place to work, great place to start your life and get a great feel for management. I would suggest working here to start your career, and hopefully better your life. I really did!"
good,This was a good place to work. They could use some work on how they talk to the employies but over all a fun place to work. Very fast past and very clean.
good,The hours were good. I only left because I moved. Customers can be trying at times but the staff were great to work with. I never had a complaint about this place
good,"it has a positive atmosphere and you can tell that the managers are all on the same page. if one section is caught up or ahead in work, their supervisor and a few others from that section will help catch the lagging one back up to demands"
good,"The short time I was at Dollar Tree, it was good. They make sure people know what their jobs and duties are as a employee. The hiring process was simple."
good,Must be willing to always play catch up with this company. Shipment always over the expected amount. Overall the customers are great just need more hands to complete tasks fully.
good,This is a good company to work for if you are just turning 18 and needing a job. I was hired on at 18 and by the time I was 19 I was an assistant manager. For this company you will be standing majority of the time so if you're used to being on your feet this job is for you.
good,i just really thought i should recieve a pay raise because i was always there when another employee did not show up way past my time to leave i stayed from opening to closing.
good,"I loved dollar tree  because it was a very enjoyable experience and because they had nice products, customers and quality guidelines for property management. -"
good,"Fun to work. Difficult sometimes, but good paying. Made a lot of friends there. Management team is very professional and helpful. Free training and good work environment."
good,what i did on my shifts was stocking the shelf's every-time the truck came my job was to UN load the truck in put all items inside warehouse an whatever needed to be put out on the floor i put on carts so they could be stocked.
good,This was a wonderful job. Went in early morning at like 4 and was off between 12-3 pm and had my whole afternoon to do things. I enjoyed unloading trucks and putting away the merchandise. Really wish i could of worked here longer then i did.
good,"Typically, I'd come to work in uniform, clock in and grab a till. I'd spend the rest of my shift alternating between the cash register and stocking shelves, depending on how busy the store was. I learned how to be a cashier and a few ins and outs of work in retail environments. The managers and employees are reasonably nice, but there was little to no conversation between coworkers. Overall, a nice temporary job, but not a great long-term place to work."
good,When i was working at the dollar tree i enjoyed working with the customers and helping my managers get things done. i enjoyed opening and closing the store
good,It was a very nice job to work at but I need more money I have Financial situations going on you bet you got to shoot something I enjoyed working there I like making the people happy I'm selling the products that dollar tree has the customer was so happy and please with the prices that we had you couldn't ask for a better store then dollar Tree
good,Dollar tree is a fun place to work at.I love the suggestive selling they do made the job more fun. I love that you always have work to do on slow times.
good,"Great place to work, relaxed environment, staff is very supportive and eager to help you hands on. This was a great place for me to learn cashier and customer service skills"
good,"Dollar Tree is a great place to work just a little slow for me I like to keep moving personally, gotta keep busy or I get bored and sleepy. I have really bad anxiety and depression that bothers me, thats why I have to maintain a job to help me stay busy. Its a great job with friendly people and great managers that try to be understanding, Its just a job thats not very busy as most jobs may be."
good,"Very nice place to work, poor manament, alot of cursing by employees, supervisors are not willing to help. No training while being hired. Alot of rules  not followed .  No lunch breaks and only one cashier for 30 people in line. Too many customers complaining."
good,Now Dollar Tree is a part time job unless you’re a manager. Dollar tree pay is not something you pay your bills with but is a job if you want extra cash. I will say I loved it so much I wouldn’t mind going back working there. My managers were amazing made work fun like a game.😂 That’s where I learned that I loved doing retail.
good,"it is always busy, you learn how to do many things at once.  The management is always helpful.  the hardest thing is stocking and the enjoyable thing is the people"
good,Everyone was amazing. I miss working there myself. The employees an customers was amazing! Pretty simple. Decent pace. Didn’t like my schedule Bc I always worked nights but was great job
good,Great Place to Work. Great People to work with I have a great relationship with my boss. Great Benefits 401k and stock at a 15 percent discount. Great HR Department.
good,Place is cool. Got to be young to work here not to much money is made. Obviously everything is priced at a dollar so can't be too much money you know.
good,I would  rather some else. The schedule was always  changing.  A lot of times employees either called in sick or didn't  call at all. So the other employees would have pick the slack.
good,"This is an amazing place to work if you're a college student, stay-at-home mom/day, or someone that just needs extra money. With a very flexible schedule, and great managers makes this an awesome day to work."
good,At this job I was a cashier as well as a stock person. I loved my job at the Dollar Tree and was devastated when the hours were cut to almost nothing and I had to find another job.
good,"I absolutely loved the store manager, but the higher-ups not as much. This is a great place to work as long as you don't plan on moving up. The pay isn't that great for cashiers, but this job is much more enjoyable as a cashier."
good,Best management team that I have been under. Positive environment. Flexibility to work the hours that are you are needing if you also have another part time job.
good,Hours were less than I had expected and I had to leave due to childcare expenses. The management team was friendly and very enjoyable to work with. I learned all basic cashier duties performing in this job experience.
good,Productive always. Customers relationships grow. Nice environment with all employees relationship. Not really stressful. Decent pay. Wear comfy shoes and always bring your energy. Didnt have many problems. I just keep a positive attitude and spen all my energy smiling.
good,Everything was a fixed price so it was easy for the cashiers not to have a drawer that collected too much to less money. But the breaks were very short so that led to being worn out on the job.
good,"First manager was a very fair and kind manager. After first manager left, this particular store went down. Last 2 managers were very nasty and mean individuals. Quite disgusting to say the least."
good,My time working at dollar tree was exciting. I have never had a job where I could connect with so many different people and take them in as my own family.
good,normal day at work i love the managers there nice helpful don't over work you but they still made sure there jobs where done. leave the store on time.
good,The calm environment helped me gain confidence and get better at my job much faster. I am able to get tasks done much earlier than when they are supposed to be done when I am in a calm environment.
good,"A pleasant and productive environment to work in."
good,I really loved the environment. It’s a fast but a happy workplace. My manager was nice but she also stayed down my back. She stood by this saying “there’s a time to play and a time to do work” and that saying taught me a lot.
good,"Meet and greet customers. Customer service. Ringing out of customer merchandise. Cash , credit and ebt use. Check processing. Cleaning and stocking of product."
good,I really enjoyed working at dollar tree if I could do it all over again I would the management when I was there was the best I really don't remember anything being hard about the job and I enjoyed every shift I worked
good,Good  place to work and learn fast paced working environment. Good place to learn how to work at a very fast and neatly pace to get the job done in a very short amount of time
good,"coworkers are nice and often easy to get along with. I did not work with the customers because I worked overnight, but the customer service is fantastic"
good,"Dollar Tree is a company where everyone can work, the customers are very kind, they're respectful.        I like  the coworkers at Dollar Tree they're understanding , helpful. I love the customer service there, the  way the customer ask for help, and thank me  .        Some customers are sometimes difficult, and unhappy, but I always make my best to  satisfy them , I always smile to them and thank them for choosing Dollar Tree as their favorite shopping place. More further I learned a lot from that job, I learn  how to treat the customers even though they seem mad, how to make them smile even though they seem mad. I learned how to calm them when they get mad ."
good,Very busy place and overall not too bad of a place to work for especially if you have a good manager. They are very flexible with hours especially having a kid.
good,"My experience at dollar tree was very wonderful all employees are very helpful and understanding in any situation. While working at dollar tree i learned so many different things such as how to properly stock shelve, assist customers, and to move at an accordingly time manner."
good,Dollar Tree is a good job for someone still in high school. They were flexible with the hours because as well I played sports. I recommend it to students.
good,Great work place with great people. Always making sure customer needs are met. Ensure that shelves are stocked in a timely manner and store is cleaned daily.
good,A very slow paced job. Not too stressful. Very to the point. Great customer service experience. Easy to learn what is expected as an employee. I enjoyed the staff and the management.
good,If you enjoy getting in some hard work and a day that flies by this is it. The atmosphere is ok the customers are great and the work is plentiful. My days always flew by and I enjoyed work.
good,"Expect to interact with customers. "
good,"I loved working for th Dollar Tree. I started when the building was just a concrete floor, went through setup, the initial delivery of inventory, to setting/stocking shelves, to Opening day and beyond. All the management personnel involved with the setup were amazing and very helpful and understanding to all the beginners. Everyone was always positive, even when they were giving you criticism."
good,I loved my job at dollar tree.  Management on the other hand not so much great advancement opportunities and awesome co workers great team players.  I loved my customers
good,"Focused on the front of the store."
good,I loved working at dollar tree and of course shopping at dollar tree. Very easy to find items and customers were great. Of course the not so pleasant customer would come in but then you would have the sweetest customer come in and wanted to pray for you.
good,"I loved working here, very professional, I met alot of amazing people/customers. I even learned how to talk in sign language and I brushed up on my communications skills."
good,Loved my coworkers an easy job.. customer's  made it fulling an my boss was awsome but  she didnt take no bs she  didnt   let  lazy people be lazy. if u did ur job an   didnt slack then this job was easy an fun.. i respected the way she ran our store best job i have ever had.
good,"Work schedule is all over the place. Although it's better than having no job at all, I'm curious about the schedule for other employees. I wonder if anyone has any sort of consistency to their schedule. Also why it is that way."
good,Register is pretty easy and everyone was helpful when I needed information about certain transactions or where products are. I enjoy interacting with the customers and helping them find what they need. It's a generally easy place to work with.
good,"Its been a great experience to work at Dollar Tree with good career opportunities."
good,"I really enjoyed working there. The people were friendly and helpful, the customers were the same. I enjoyed my shifts and duties that were required of me. I would recommend to anyone looking for work to apply."
good,The days went by fast. most for the people that worked there were freidly. the maneger was awsum. breaks were fair. Dealing with costemers could be chalenging at times.
good,Things are not very organized with the scheduling of hours and what needs to be done. I think things should be explained more on what you are suppose to be doing on your shift.  Some confusion between employees on this subject. More training needed with all employees that work here.
good,The overall experience was ok at best. Very nice employees and customers. Management was great and very responsible. Store was always clean and met store standards.
good,I loved working at Dollar Tree  The work environment was excellent my boss was great very respectful and fair I loved going to work I got along with all of my co-workers we were like a family  if not for making a poor decision in my life I would still be employed there
good,I loved working there. There were doll moments. The managers were not the best. Managers would down grade me in front of costumers. Coworkers were enjoyable to work with.
good,I enjoy working for dollar tree it just money tight and I need a better paying job plus I don't like the health insurance plan I hate to leave they are like my family but I have bills and the money just not enough.

There's almost no honesty and policy rules get thrown around when it's to their advantage. We have a great crew and ops manager but even when people don't show up for work, they still say there's no hours, at least not for me. You can't choose favorites and you're not suppose to lie to your employees but it happens. Besides the asst. Mgr, I 've been here the longest and still waiting to advance as I watch the new ones come in and 3-4 months later, promoted to a management position. I still love my store and co-workers when they're being fair.  I wish the company would allow us the hours to maintain the store so we can work at a comfortable level instead of running up and down the aisles to stock. We're not allowed to work comfortably or enjoy our job. Nobody wants to clean the store at closing and most of the time, won't allow me to clean it. Finally get a good check, and they cut my hours."
good,"Everything about my job stocking overnight at Dollar Tree was perfectly fine except the pay and the fact i was only a seasonal hire with the possibiity of staying a permanent worker if she had the ability . My manager was wonderul, very kind and warm and i never had one single problem with her or anyone i worked with. That is, until one employee called OSHA out of spite because she was fired for no call no showing on the night of a large holiday related truck that we NEEDED all the help we could get for. Only negative thing to happen during my employment there."
good,It Was A Really Nice Job The Experience Wasn’t Bad The People Were Very Friendly And Super Nice an they had a very professional management I’m really thankful for the experience
good,"Flexible hours but unless you are a manager you will not get decent hours. Plus, the wage is minimum and people that worked there for awhile never got raises."
good,"Well to be honest, I have liked working at Dollar Tree but, I have a daughter that's almost 6 years old and I can't take care of her and myself too well on what I'm making. It's time for me to find another job with better pay and hours. I like most of the people there but I have to do better for myself and my child... The hardest part of the job for me is sometimes standing in one place for hours at a time. The most enjoyable part is the friends I have made there, I love them like family and will miss working with them..."
good,"Very productive upscale and get work done ,Sometimes slow as  the weekend comes in  , I like working at dollar tree ,  The managers Treat you equally i love it"
good,"a typical day at work for me was usually started after my college for the day "
good,"Slow -paced environment that helps with communication skills. Good for  a first job maybe not a career unless you get into a full time higher up position. Great environment, part time hours were  okay I suppose."
good,Dollar tree was a wonderful place to work. Everyone was so nice and helpful. If  I needed help or wanted more hours they would do anything they could to help me out. If I could ever work for Dollar Tree again I would definitly go back.
good,"Most managersbcan work with flexible scheduling, decent hours, and I worked with nice people. Transfering was simple and I personally moved up realistically fast."
good,I love how it is constantly busy not only on the register but on the floor stocking shelves and cleaning up like organizing. but i love how the customer love it when you help them with no hesitation and i love how the customer compliments how the store looks and how I am doing my job.
good,"Slow days usually"
good,"Satisfied to say the least ,me and my fellow employees along with management have a great relationship considering our indivisual tasks,great company make of a successful team environment."
good,"the days get very busy but when you work with an amazing team the job gets done quickly and effectively, There are times when the workers feel as though we are getting way to short of the hours we are allowed to work."
good,Really enjoyed this job only certain ppl were hard to work with. Job was overall easy. Management was willing to work with employees on schedules as long as they were willing so show up on time and do their job.
good,A typical work day can start off stressful but it usually slow down close to closing time. The skills that I learned from this job was working with a cash register and learning that all cash register are not the same. Management at the Dollar Tree I was located at was good. The manager I had did a lot even though she didn't need to. the hardest part of my job is my manager doesn't communicate with about changes going in the work space. I can honestly say I enjoy the customers I met and help.
good,"Wish I could have stayed but I had to relocate , I had very great co workers , only thing is the assosicates were alittle unreliable so made it hard for the work say"
good,when i started here everything was great. the people where amazing. slowly those people left the manager left and things started being very inconsistent.
good,Was very enjoyable until new management changed everything.pleasant customers...work enviroment friendly...at times like family....tasks are repeted constantly...job can be teadous.
good,The environment and co workers were pleasant.  The job itself was not stressful and the customers were great.  The only time it was stressful was when shipment day arrived.
good,"The Environment was pretty Relaxed, The only problem was the lack of advancements and no real benefits to the job like other retail stores offer, which is unfortunate but not unfair due to the type of job."
good,"I worked at the busiest time of the year “thanksgiving and Christmas “ and it was always busy. I loved my co-workers, very happy environment. Friendly customers."
good,Dollar Tree can be an awesome job. It takes good management to be in place to have an successful store. It takes good people to keep everyone motivate to run a successful store.
good,"Great part time job "
good,"Overall, Dollar tree is a fun a friendly environment if only the team workers are friendly and are not bias towards other employees, and customers. I would have to say though If i see lack of workmanship from an employee I would recommend reporting them to a higher boss because their lack of work ethic effects the company and the overall environment of the store and business sales. Because people shop with their eyes and if a messy store is intaked customers won't be pleased, therefore low sales and less customers."
good,Good place to work pretty fast pace and good place to learn how to work in the retail jobs. My manager was an understandable person and easy going. Good starter job.
good,"I was a full time ASM ,who transferred to another state,"
good,Dollar Tree is not a good place to work permanently but is a great part time resource. I worked through college making enough for bills and groceries.
good,Its always nice working at the dollar tree. I've learn so much that should have patience with people and gain experience . The hardest part at the dollar tree is stocking. You have to work it out you schedule for their truck if its coming on time or not. The most enjoyable was the people/coworker. everyone are having a good time even though your at worker. everyone get along nicely.
good,The company should fix a few things. But if you are looking for part time then it should be okay. Some workers are underpaid for all of their hard work and dedication.
good,A typical day at work is running around completing tasks non-stop or at register. The management has become sort of conflicting. The hardest part is trying to get everything done and the enjoyable part is getting along and joking with your co-workers. Everyone acts almost like a family with joking and laughter but we do have our complaints. It's stressful trying to get enough hours and do everything required or only minimum wage and every cashier is considered part-time.
good,Dollar tree is alright to start out with as an entry level job. Benefits are decent for people who stay long enough and become mangers at the company. Just if you are going to college or looking to pay a lot of bills and finances I recommend this job morover to a high school student or someone looking to get Workin experience. This job is good to have though as a secondary or a primary job if you're looking for multiple jobs.
good,Working for the Dollar Tree company was only temporary for myself. I knew when I first got the job based on the pay rate I would not be there long what so ever.Other than that I enjoyed working there I loved my manager and my fellow associates.
good,"This place was awesome to work at, of course you have to realize you won't be making a ton of money but they work with your schedule the management is awesome and you get to see all the fun new products that come through. It's not a hard job and if you just want to make a little money or its your first job I would definitely recommend it!"
good,"At my dollar tree only managers are given full time. I learned a lot over the past 2 years working there. Management isn't too hard. All my managers love me and have no problem with me and they even recommended me to becoming a closing asm but the store did not have enough hours to support another asm, There's not really anything hard about the job."
good,"I worked a cashier and.  I greeted the customers when the approach the store. When not busy stocked the Selves. Made them look presentable, Swepted the floors"
good,"I had a good experience gained experience in retail, customer service and as a cashier made friends and met new people. The pay and hours weren’t that great but hey it’s better than nothing. Great manager"
good,Dollar tree is a good place to work if youre still in school or need to add little income .. The pay is low.. Too low for families. But you work with great people and management..
good,"Passionate, compassionate, respectable, professionals, hard workers, sincere, honest and provides affection to all as family members and fun workplace to remember forever in life"
good,"being a greeter and a cashier and a stocker it can be very easy going, but the traffic is very busy at times and we must maintain the store because we do haver runners that jet out the front doors with merchandise, we need to be alert an on top of things for safety and our business too implore"
good,"Im not going to review this company, Was there for 4 years that says enough. Each store is different in ref to management. You will like working there if you have the right people."
good,"I loved working here, the majority of customers were great and I was always busy, as well as I enjoyed the people I worked with. I found this to be one of my favourite jobs and would not have left had I not had to move."
good,"Dollar Tree is not the job that can stress you out, there is a good balance of chaos and organization. It teaches patience and understanding. "
good,It was a great place to work but the hours were awful and some of the managers were lazy and very rude. The cut your hours if you have to call in for court or anything else.
good,"Working at Dollar Tree is fairly easy and great for those looking for a first time job. Availability is definitely a big part of working here because many people call out and they will expect you to be able to come in. They're always looking for employees who can close as well. Management is okay, I never had a big problem with anybody there. Hardest part was multitasking between being a cashier and stocking, also getting to know the different parts of the star and where different items were located."
good,Great place to shop before going any where else. Got to love the Dollar tree. The store is one of the best in the United States. If we don't have it you don't need it.
good,"There's no benefits and no moving up to a higher position. Raises are minimum and it's only part-time, you're lucky if you get a total of 20 hours a week."
good,Work was fun and the work was easy. The other employees were nice and cooperative to work with. I enjoyed coming into work when I did and due to personal issues I was sad to leave my position at dollar tree.
good,I was able to learn more about how items needed to be stocked in different isles of the store. Now keeping the store clean was hard at times with the customers would come in and out of the store.
good,"Most times worked 7 a.m to 9 at night and got bi-weekly pay of maybe 300$. Place is a rip off when it comes to paying their employees! Hard hard work for little pay, not worth it. Very judgmental work environment. Hardest part was being around co-workers who would get treated better for doing less!"
good,The most enjoyable thing that I did while working at dollar tree was talking to the customers. I loved to talk to everyone and be friendly. I helped everyone find what they needed in the store. The worst part about working at Dollar tree was that I needed to stack shelves. Stacking shelves was incredibly hard and if you didn't do it right you would get in trouble.
good,Busy place to work. I loved helping customers with their purchases. Organized and clean. Product recovery kept me busy when I was not helping customers.
good,Typical day at work entails bagging groceries and keeping the store clean. After working there for a while you learn to have a thicker skin for some of the ruder people you come across. But having a good boss and managers makes life a lot easier. Except for the occasional bad customer the hardest part of my day is keeping the isles clear of go-back items. Though all that the best aspect of my job is being able to constantly meet new people and being able to be myself around my co-workers without worrying about being judged.
good,i really enjoyed working at dollar tree. it was a very easy fun job. i made a lofelong friend within minutes of my first day. I learned how to be more organize and learned how to be a better person.
good,overall a great place to work with great people to work with. I have never experienced anything that I couldn't handle or any employees with which I could not work with.
good,I love working at the dollar tree its a fun work environment I have enjoyed the work place as well as the employees their. i will miss them all. specially Andy my manager
good,I really enjoyed working there because mostly because it was overnites and because of the freedom to work at my own pace and without the General Public also liked the fast pace and physical labor required
good,"It was a regular sales job. I learned that if you are willing to be nearby, management will be more likely to call you to fill shifts. "
good,Awesome first job I had it is simple and less stressful then other jobs I had. The hours were good but they should make it into a full time for those that want extra money.
good,I love working with people and assisting them in their needs. I also love informing the customers about new items and also the items of the week.  I am glad to be apart of dollar tree because we provide low price items for low income families and even those who love a deal.
good,"Dollar tree was my first job. Very easy to learn, doing cashier and stock. I recieved a raise within my first year of working here but this is not a company you can move up in., maybe to assistant manager but that's all."
good,good company to work it. I learn a lot to work in a small environment. deal with customer is what make the job better. knowing that they are satisfy.
good,When I would get there in the morning i would stock the shelves with merchandise. I learned how to be patient with the customers and how to do customer service. the hardest part would have been some co-workers would try to bully people and intimidate. I love they would work with my schedule.
good,"The people I work with are great and the customers are normally very nice. There is usually a lot of work to be done, but we always work as a team so there isn't normally a problem getting everything done."
good,"Management was good, the co-workers were a fun group of people to work with. the job was fairly easy to handled. the only problem was there was not enough hours to work, had to find another job."
good,my co workers are very fun to work with short breaks and managers are nice also. Work minimum hours don't get paid alot. Would like a different job to get bills paid
good,I was a cashier. Also processed freight in a timely manner.  Management was excellent. Pleasing customers.  It was a fun place to work.
good,"Great place to work and allows you to build on your productivity, time management skills, and customer hospitality skills. If you up for a fast paced environment this may be a job for you."
good,"Always Busy: Customers/freight/Cleaning. I love my job and I like most of the people I work with."
good,"Wonderful place to work at with great customerservice coworkers are nice management is as well everything is affordable great new thing for the house,school,kids,events,Holladays,food,medicine cosmetics"
good,"easy to connect with the other team members. was also to aid in assisting manager on several projects with redecorations to the store during sales, seasonal themes, etc."
good,"Love meeting people and just helping my customer and working with my coworkers is a great challenge,by just making the store up to it's part stocking, getting balloon orders ready and just working as a team,great boss man for letting you grow and to be on your own when it comes time for changing the broad."
good,Everyone their was really friendly and hard working knew their jobs and willing to do it. There where times we was short handed but we did what we can . always willing to help eachother
good,Really good place to work for teenagers not as many hours but a really good job Coworkers were awesome we all got along I've learned how to satisfy customers management was great the hardest part of the job was when i had unhappy customers
good,used a cash register and spoke with customers and had a lot of fun although the management of a few cashiers was favortism even when i picked up hours they wouldn't take
good,Productive and good benefits. A good company to work for. I had the pleasure to meet some very nice and helpful coworkers and managers. And I learn a lot of new skill and trades as well.
good,A typical day I walked In spoke to everyone greet with a smile checked in and starting on my register. I learned a lot about customer service from communicating to helping around the store. My manager was a very intelligent lady that I respect a lot she was very patient and helpful when you need her assistance. The employees are very nice people they helped you when you needed the help they never complained. At times the job was hard for me to stand for 6 or 7 hours straight even on break because there wasn't a break room. Besides that I enjoyed working there a lot.
good,although I loved working here for some reasons the store couldn't keep a steady manager it was awful they kept bringing new people in and then firing them within months the saddest part of my job.
good,"Dollar Tree was an interesting first time job. At first everything is confusing but after a few days of work I was able to get in a rhythm. Management was rough but they wanted to be firm on what needed to be done and at the same time have fun. My coworkers, I had little interaction with them due to small work teams, but when We worked together we got along pretty well. The hardest part of the job is when things get busy during the holidays and the lines seem to never end, but at the end of they day I felt accomplished. The enjoyable parts of the day is when everything is steady and the work gets done."
good,"Dollar Tree Stores is the perfect place to begin your job experience. This was my very first and only job and I can't complain! Working here is a day filled with both ups and downs but when involving my coworkers, it makes the ups defeat the downs. Being here for 2, almost 3 years has taught me how to work in customer service and how to always keep a positive attitude. The most enjoyable part of this job is the positive customers that always brighten up my day."
good,"Dollar tree is a easy going job. I cashier, communicate with customer, stock supplies and keep shelves in an orderly manner."
good,"A typical day at work consist of me checking people at the register.  I learned how to function a cash register, and how to stock shelves.  The managers were very sincere and easy going, they didn't get mad a lot and we got along smoothly. Every person that worked with me had a very positive attitude toward me and everyone around them."
good,"Work usually went by pretty fast, i learned how to deal well with people. Excellent store manager, she was always there to lend a hand. Great coworkers, we were all like family. The hardest part of the job, was cleaning the store during the ""busy"" season. I enjoyed everything about my job."
good,"good place overall, great co workers and okay hours, friendly people and customers as well"
good,"I have amazing co-workers, I love that I get to interact with multiple people whether it is internal or external customers, and it is a medium paced work environment."
good,The pay wasn't great but they were willing to work with you. Typical day at work consisted of running cash register and stocking shelves as needed and providing great customer service. The management was alright and the hardest part of the job was keeping up with customers trashing the store. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting a break from register and being able to stock shelves and beautify the store.
good,A typical day at work. I would get to work at 8:00am and I would start my work day and I would have to help stock. Then costumers would start coming in and they would look around until they found everything they needed or wanted. I would stay where I could see my register and walk to my register and ask the customer if they was ready to check out. If they was i would put my information in so i could start checking them out. My co-workers helped me out a lot if it wasn't for them i wouldn't have been able to work so easily at all. So i do thank my co-workers for helping me when I would get stuck on something.
good,"early morning hours, stocking shelves.nice people to work with just not enough hours"
good,"It was a pleasure working for them, they provided a friendly atmosphere where I could learn quickly. They were also very patient in teaching me."
good,i learn alot when i work and i enjoy being around others and have fun.the hardest time of a job is when you have things go wrong with something. but you can work it out. what i enjoy most about my job i the people. and about my co-workers their ok. the enjoyable part of my job is making the costumer happy.

good,i work cashier and handle customers needs and wants on a day to day basis i learned that a happy customer is a return customer i work with alot of great people they are all so friendly and helpful
good,"i enjoy it some days, management was okay but i always needed back-up because i would be the only cashier doing a 5 hr period"
good,they are a by the rules place
good,"My days start anywhere from 5 am to 7am. And usually last 10 to 12 hours. I work with customers all the time. With some office work like scheduling, managing payroll, and cash flow. I have learned a lot about merchandising and payroll that I previously didn't know. My supervisor is helpful for the most part. Overall good. My co-workers are good. Like to learn and like to teach. The hardest part of the day is not being able to spend as much time with my family as I would like to. The most enjoyable part of my day is helping customers and feeling accomplished when getting a lot of work done."
good,this company is great to work for but the lines be too long and not enough workers
good,Either you are cashiering or putting up the freight throughout the day. AM shifts were putting up the freight while PM shift was cleaning up the store for the next day while also counting down each register and safe.
good,Worked part-time on select schedules mostly afternoons. Mostly operated Cash register and interacting with customers. I learnt to be patient with customers and treat them with respect. Management was helpful assisting me with the skills I needed to do the job and co-workers were understanding and helpful too. Hard part was dealing with returns from customers and dealing with those that needed fast service because they had to be somewhere else during busy times..
good,"a typical day at work i help costumers item for item, hold friendly conversation. And make sure evryone has a great day. I learned how to be very heplful when needed and wok in a timely fashion. all my co-worker are very friendly and are about there job. I respect me and my job and i have no problem at work."
good,"typical day is great, friendly customers and great products at an affordable price. management are helpful and friendly. hardest part is being on your feet for so many hours but the most enjoyable part is watching the look on customers faces when they see a product and cant believe its being sold for the price!"
good,Stand at the registar and check out the customers. Handle cash and complete transactions. Set up displays and clean up the registars and the ilses as needed.
good,Typical day at work would be walking in checking in and greeting my customers. and getting very welcomed. Managers were very great. Made me feel comfortable working with them as an employer
good,On a day to day i see people come and go as we work hard and seaport echother. Staff are frendly and hard workers. Environment is well cleand and taken care of.
good,Dollar tree is a part time job its a great place to work for someone to start getting in the field to find a job they are great people that work there they pay rate is okay
good,"I would still work here if they offered 20 hours at least and paid a little more. The manager was awesome, but could use a little morning training in employee etiquette. The customers were great, co workers were wonderful."
good,I really enjoyed working for dollar tree.  I did not like working many nights til closing and weekends.  But the manager was great and the coworkers were all team players and willing to help out.

good,Was part time. Was able to keep up with others. Worked all over store. Great experience. Had a great team to help me when needed. Manager was very helpful
good,They’re definitely flexible and have given me many years of security and I appreciate them very much. The labor isn’t excessive at all. It’s average and very easy as well as self explanatory.
good,"The people I worked with and under were wonderful people.  Sweet and understanding and done everything they could to help. Work hard and do your job and things go smoothly,  and they will be willing to help you when you need time off or when there are emergencies."
good,From my point of view the job at dollar tree was going great I had made friends there while I was working. Also felt like I was becoming more of a better person working
good,It's fast passed checking out customers and replenishing merchandise. If you are a cashier your 4 to 4 1\2 shift goes by quickly checking out customers. It's a decent place to work.
good,"I like to meet that is new people there at Dollar tree.what I dislike about my company that is,not enough hours and not enough breaks and can’t listen to no music at my work not at all"
good,I liked working here it was easy and the public/ customers liked me because im pleasant and always smiling. Some wud even wait in line jus to have me check them out.
good,When I got hired I was only interested in nights and no weekends.  At first I was on morning shifts and worked weekends. Being a new hire I didn't complain about the weekend work but I did mention the morning. With in the next week it was changed to all nights.  My boss is great guy and my coworkers are very nice.  Great place to work.
good,"Dollar Tree is a great starting job, for those first time overly eager teenagers. However it is also a good secondary source of income, for any retirees. That want to remain, physically active outside of home."
good,None  at this time sorry I dont have anything else to say about this dollar tree store at this moment it was a cool store just wish I could have went back
good,This job is a fast paced slow paying job. There is little room for advancement. The pay is minimum wage. You only get raises once a year and it's a quarter.
good,I love working at Dollar Tree. Good people good environment! There is never a dull day at the Tree. It is very fast past most of the time. Sometimes its slow.
good,"A good regional, trainer, and a good District Manager. I enjoyed my time with company until a bad district manager was my boss. We thrived in a group successful environment which every player has goals and we worked together to solved them. My time in Charleston and Seneca was rewarding because I was trained to adjust and train mine the same."
good,its not a bad place to work at its really comfortable there but really the only bad part about it from my experience is i kept getting teased at the cash register other than that i i did mop and clean the floor but i manly do stocking it was fun.
good,My work experience was great at dollar tree. The job at dollar tree could had been more professional. The manager lacked a lot of communication with me.
good,"Great work place very friendly customers! Coworkers are very friendly and helpful to each other and the customers, clean place to work, fast paste environment as well"
good,It was a very laid back environment. A little too laid back.  Management was lacks in duties therefore the store suffered in how it ran and appeared to the public it served. It was very easy to find time to do my register and clean and restock at the same time.
good,I love to work around people dollar tree is a way to have great customer service experience there is a lot of ways to learn an experience new things it’s an alsome opportunity
good,"I love working at Dollar Tree!  Have the ocassional bad customer, but the majority makes ups for them.  Just wish that the pay would be increased a little, and maybe have some benefits.  But all in all a great place to work."
good,Good temporary job but for long term im not sure financially it would work out without a second income. Overall a good job to either start with or have as a second job
good,"Doesnt seem that you can advance. Store manager is great works well with the staff. If you could advance like it advertises.  Co-workers are great also. Customers can be challenging, but if you have a can do personally you will be fine working there."
good,This was a great place to work but I got a divorce and move here to florida. But it was a great place to work I had a nice boss and coworkers . I would recommended this place to anyone
good,learned how to drive a pallet jack was a good place to work for just needed something closer to ardmore. the hardest thing about the job was trying to move 300 pallets in 8 hours. the only way to get that was to move double stacks
good,I enjoyed working there and the coworkers were fun to work with.  My manager was great to work with and communicated well with workers. The hardest task was unloading the truck. The best part of the job i enjoyed was the customer's and keeping them happy!
good,"Not the hardest job ever. It is a very simple, easy, basic job to do. There is no stress involved. You just need to scan items and place them in bags and make sure the register does not go over or under by $3 or you're fired."
good,"I loved working for Dollar Tree. My favorite part was doing the trucks and stocking the floor. My least favorite was handling money. In management, you work a lot bc unfortunately people call out. Working weekends and holidays in retail are a must. Great job tho."
good,Loved working at dollar tree it was always busy ...i have always loved working with the public..got along with all the co-workers ..i would go back in a heart beat if they would match the money I'm making at Publix right now ..
good,My experience at Dollar Tree has been very beneficial to me I love talking to the customers and interacting with I am a people person and I love talking to customers.
good,Good place to work for a single person living at home. No benefits low salary. Management is great. No good hours. Except around the holidays. Fun relaxed
good,"I start my day at 7am, I verify funds, go to bank if change is needed, complete morning paperwork. I interview once or twice a week. As manager I have to set seasonal and maintain. Ensure all employees are aware of their tasks for the day, manage time and budget."
good,it was a fun place to work and my co workers were great I liked the fact that they just let you be to do your work and that they had chances for u to get a promotion
good,"Dollar Tree is a great part time job. Pretty repeative work day in day out! I liked knowing what I was going to do ,what time I came in and what time I would be leaving with no doubt"
good,"As a former employee with Dollar Tree, the work was mainly my home and co-workers were more like family. Customers were on most often kind, understanding, but many would also pose a challenge with customer service skills. Advancement can be quick. Pay is overall adequate. Overtime has to be approved, but a rarity. Work in general can be stressful, but only due to call off's and no shows. Overall a great place to further gain skills with customer service skills, deal with stressful situations, but also make a family not just with coworkers but customers as well."
good,Its a great place to work for interacting with the public and job security but the pay is the worst and advancement varies. The shifts are short and there is a lot to know.
good,"I enjoyed my employment at the Dollar Tree, the other staff members were very friendly. I looked forward to work, had a very energetic attitude. Recommend this employer."
good,"This job was very easy, getting to see all the new stock coming in was a big plus! The checkout process is very simple and stocking is very easy as well."
good,"Had I not had to relocate for awhile and help with granddaughter I would still be there. Friendly staff, customers were amazing. Manager was a very outgoing boss who trainded very well and didn't make u feel like u we're doing it wrong. Hardest part of job was not knowing we're everything was at forst"
good,"The management is great, the staff is great, no complaints.They work with you on explaining things that are hard to understand. They also allow you to work at your own pace."
good,"smile, greet and thank every customers for there service. give announcements over the loud speakers of the values to good to pass up. ask the customers if they would like to give donations to our troops serving for us over seas. let the customers know about our survey at the bottom of their receipts to enter in for a chance to win money also to let dollar tree know how our customer service has been  while shopping dollar tree.always thanking our customers at the end of the transactions."
good,"They are a great company to work for with keeping you productive, there is always something to do, your never board there. Always great the customer with a nice smile, you are supporting dollar tree with every customer, you want to make sure they will be back, that they see the workers are friendly and treat them kindly, that this is a good clean and safe environment to be in when the customers come in the door. The management is friendly and are there to help you with whatever you need and are happy to do it, the teamwork in the workplace is good and friendly to support one another. The hardest part of the job may be that it is a faster pace during the holiday season and can be hard when the customer isn't friendly or impatient or to take in so many people for some time. The best part is everyone likes each other and helps each other, and we bring snacks on occasion for doing a good job,"
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help people find what they was looking for in the store.  However we didn't get many hours, and they didn't pay us very well."
good,I loved working here. I love organizing things and i did a lot of that while stocking merchandise. i worked the register and that was very easy. I would love to have the time to work here again.
good,The hours and pay are not enough to live on. They pay min wage and schedule 4 to 5 hour shifts even during holidays which is thier busiest time of year. I get on avg 10-15 hours a week no benefits. The management is great and the other employees are amazing to work with. Layed back environment and friendly.
good,"My experience at Speedway was one of the best work experiences I have ever experienced.  The managers were always understanding of my needs, and would step in if I needed help at the register."
good,Great first job. Managment was great. Hardest part of the job was having to check people out and then having to stock while still having to keep an eye out from across the store
good,It was a great experience learned a lot really enjoyed the crew and loved helping the friendly customers just wish they paid more and gave benefits to all employees not just management me they really just needed a lot of help putting freight on the shelves and also unloading the freight truck that comes once every week
good,Great place to go  shopping. For all your food and holiday stuff. For all seasons .the selection of sutff you find is awesome and its all fir a dollar.
good,"Relaxed work place and can be hectic at times, unloading truck can be fun and stocking shelves it ok, they try to work with you on a schedule if you are a student, or needing a certain day off"
good,The Store Manager of this business gave me my first role as a manager even though it was part time. She was always good to me and I enjoyed the work I performed. Pay rates and benefits lack for employees
good,I believe working at Dollow Tree is a great way for beginner in work experience to build confidence to speak to others. This job has given me opportunity to come out of my comfort zone to be able to speak to customers. I’ve been able to help customers have a better day simply by doing my job.
good,"Unboxed shipments and label them correctly and neatly, The work place was very fast paced. We had to restock shelves and make sure to items never run out on the sales floor."
good,Dollar tree is a great place to work for young people that are looking for a job while in school. This company also has managers that are willing to work with you if you have a tight schedule.
good,"I love working at dollar tree you stay busy and get to meet new people daily, your constantly moving so day goes by fast, you are able to work at other dollar trees if hours are available."

good,Excellent company all should apply fast advancement teach alot and learn learn learn and grow within the company the funnest thing is learning procedure managing a crew and growing as a person
good,Working at Dollar tree was actually fun. I loved that all of the managers are hard working and nice. They are very sympathetic and understanding as well. The hours are very flexible and the work environment is great. I would suggest this job lead to someone in college or for someone just trying to make ends meet.
good,This was my first job. My manager was awesome and was always willing to work with me. The environment was great and my day was never boring. The position was great for me at the time but I’m not sure how it would be for me now as an adult (as far as being able to pay bills).
good,"I loved working with the friendly group of employees that I was working with and I love how often they switch the shelves. Manager was awesome, very helpful and upbeat."

good,"My Day's Always went Well At The Store I Had A Wonderul Manager and Everything Went Smooth, Everyone Got Along We Came in And did what Was Exspected Of Us, And We Always Met The Requirements That Was Exspected As a team Before The end Of The Night"
good,"Job was mostly fun,it was the Christmas season and most people are happy that time of year. Typical day consisted of checking items at register,stocking when new product came in,sometimes clean-up,and restocking things that had been left in wrong place. I liked my manager,professional,fair,and friendly. I guess the hardest part of the job would be sometimes so busy didn't get a break for 5 or 6 hours. The best part was interacting with customers,I loved the happy faces."
good,"Stock shelves, clean your work area, assisted customers, returned boxes to bailer, cashier and greeted customers. Team members made going to work enjoyable."
good,"I very much enjoyed my coworkers and awesome management!!! However, I believe that the management and employees of the company should have been compensated a bit more within a reasonable pay scale, due to the duties carried out by each worker..."
good,I loved working at dollar tree my managers were the best ..hours are great. If for some reason u need to change shift or any family matter the will work with you the best they can. I really do t have any thing bad to say about dollar tree
good,Dollar Tree is a good place to work if you need a decent check. It help you to meet and greet people and have a good day with the customers. It helps you grow and learn about the people in your community.
good,I think it's a great place for people who are just starting to work.  People are very nice and friendly . Flexible hours .they work with you for days off
good,Dollar tree is a fast paced place you have to keep moving at all times. Your work hours are based on your work performance I love working at dollar tree.
good,I had the best managers and they always keep there store in tip top shape and I respected that. I enjoy keeping things in order so it made it easier for customers to find what they needed. Working cashier gave me the opportunity to meet people an d stocking was a challenge in itself.
good,Great pleace to work. Friendly staff. Friendly management. Easy laid back job. Good pay.  Cash handling. Restocking. Long term work environment. Nice ceos
good,Like I said in my review salary. Dollar Tree is the best company I have ever worked for. You just don't pay your non-management enough and I didn't get enough hours to cover half of the cost of living. Great place to work.
good,Greet customers 
good,"In a overall review I loved working at Dollar Tree, it had some ups and down for me. For it being my first job it was a great experience for me. To see my potential as well knowing how fast I had got promoted there for being reliable. Dollar Tree helped me gained experience in management. It’s a good company to work for when only needing a part time job. The more reliable you are, the more hours you were able to get when needed by them."
good,"check people out stock shelves. work with money, Managament is not very good. Work place was nice to work in. Hardest part is to work enough hours with out taking a second job. helping out the guest was the best part"
good,"I would come in and review the apple seed Daily check sheet, count safe, set tasks for warehouse and cashiers, write off or repair damaged items, work on displays, run freight, check in all delivery's. assist customers"
good,"Management isn't strict as long as your ready to give customers your full attention when they need assistance. Typically during work you only show up for your shift, although, if you arrived for the earlier shift and someone has called in they may ask you to stay otherwise you will go home. The company doesn't offer any form of raise unless you move up as a store manager or assistant manager."
good,"Everything was okay , has fun , stayed in my feet , I was a good worker didn't cause no problems and I would go back . But I just wanted more hours . Yes"
good,"The most enjoyable part of working at dollar tree was making my customers feel happy and welcomed, so that way they have a great shopping experience with us. a typical day at work is making sure the store is cleaned put all new items out front, have your drawer counted before the doors open. The hardest part of the job is the short hours and the pay. the management was awesome I had some good mentors and great relationships with people."
good,"Would be a decent choice for a second job, only part-time hours are available unless you're management. Decent workplace, good coworkers, fairly busy most of the time."
good,i had fun working at dollar tree on of the best jobs so far but i was only there seasonal job but they did said they will hired me again when they need people work there
good,I personally enjoy working here a lot. It is very upset and face paced but also relaxing. The workers are very understanding and friendly. The management is also brilliant.
good,"I was just moved up to ops asm. The training wasnt great, but my manager made sure i knew what i was doing. in any position, the employee is expected to do a lot for not a lot of pay at all. i was happy to get a raise in hours and in wage, but its still not enough to even try to make a living off."
good,"Friendly, wonderful coworkers and managers, flexibility with schedule. Great job for little extra cash in your pocket. Hard to leave work without buying something."
good,"Great place to work, short shifts so you don't get burned out!  Very repetitive work and always on your feet. You meet a lot of customers. Co-workers are fun to work with and it is a team based environment."
good,I’m looking for a cashier job my other job was  productive slow and easy i  did facing stocking the throw back and cashier I can always have a daycare job bc I had that in the past as well
good,typically it’s pretty easy work.give your job100% effort but everyone does things differently. Management is great I couldn’t as for better managers. The hardest part is probably the Holliday’s because you barely move from the registers. Enjoyable part of the job is seeing the customers happy.
good,I loved working for Dollar Tree.  I was never still and I always had contact with the public.  I loved working with people who viewed each other as family.  There was a lot of different things that were expected to be perfect which were impossible (one person recover entire store in 5 hours) and whenever I had a moment we would all pitch in and help get it done.
good,"Easy fast past job, You learn how to great every customer even if they have been in more than once. Management is great. They train you in the right way. The hardest part of my job is getting hours I can work, and the most enjoyable part is satisfying the customers."
good,"I enjoyed working at Dollar Tree due to staying busy at all times, flexible hours so you can have another job or school. The management was very understanding."
good,It is an okay place to work for the pay and the hours. The management team is good to work for on each shift. The crew is alright too. I like working the hours I work because I still get to work my full time job.
good,while there i was the closing shift. Job place closed at 9pm. Enjoyable part would be coming in and seeing everyone. The least enjoyable part would be being the only one there during the night shift. everyone from day shift would be leaving when i got there.
good,I  liked  meeting  me  people everyday.  Helping the customers  and it  was a  fun  place  to  work  everyday.  I learned a lot about  working with the public.
good,A fast paced fun place to work with amazing coworkers. Always lots of things to do so your never just sitting around being bored. Mangers do their best to work with your schedule and personal life.
good,I loved working for Dollar Tree. I thought it was awesome. Getting to meet new people. Great job for a college student. Not bad for a first time job experience.
good,they had tried to fire be one time because another girl had worked there and her name was alex and mine is alexander so when we both started the same week the GM had mixed up our names and handed us the opposite schedule and tried to fire me for a no show when it was the other girl named ALEX this happened twice.
good,I liked working there i did everything i was so reliable management would leave me alone in store and i wasnt a manager i knew how to do everything i just wish it had full time hours or over time i would still be woking there
good,Dollar tree is a very good place to work.  The staff is very accommodating and understanding.  I enjoyed working there.I will refer others to the company.
good,"I would recommend working there to anyone. It is a enjoyable, fast paced place to work.  The co-workers are nice to work with and u get along with all the employees."
good,"Stocked shelves, waited on customers, and completed cash sales.  When worked to close helped manager do close down procedures and get bank deposit ready.  Thoroughly enjoyed job.  Worked with excellent staff.  Waiting on public was very satisfying.  The hardest part of job was standing on feet for long periods of time.  The most enjoyable part was dealing with public."
good,"Meet lots of people each and everyday. I learn how everyone feels and how to read faces and tones. Hardest part is not having enough hours to go around.  Most enjoyable thing is all the smiling face you see everyday,"
good,"Loved working there, just poor supervision on the DM's part.  Could'nt take vacation when I wanted to, also made us schedule ourselves for 50 hours a week, which was not company policy."
good,It was a very fun job. I am a people person and I loved working with the public. I loved the employees and the bosses. It is a fun environment and I really enjoyed my time working there.
good,i love working at dollar tree its one of my fav hobs that i have every had but i dont like ths fact they dont give very much hours or have one worker working during the busy times!!! but over all i love working there
good,"At the Dollar Tree its really a fun place to work at. You get to talk to customers, talk to employees, just really relaxed. I can say that unloading a truck is a bit time consuming and can make you very tired, but as long as you have people to socialize with the time goes so fast. For me Dollar Tree has flexible working hours which if your a bisy person just let them know what days you can work and they will be willing to change it. The best part at Dollar tree and just knowing that your going to another place where it feels like your with family and doing like a little project along with it, you really wont noticed how much your doig because your doing it in a pace that suit you so thats what i really liked about it. im still currently working for them and still love it."
good,"For sure a typical day at work for me would consist of cashing out customers, helping with any questions a customer would have about an item far as location, and price.  Cleaning, and stocking items as well as placing carts back at the front of the store."
good,A typical day at dollar tree was very fun.i learned that when you are a great person it can make a work place numbers go up.the managment there were crooks and took from they workers.the work place was fun.the hardest part of the job was how hard i worked for my money they still stole from me.the enjoyable part was making clean money close to the house.
good,My job task were too clean restroom and restock shelves make sure that the store was kept neat and provide customers service to all customers  in the store making them feel welcome to the store
good,I worked for Dollar Tree for two-and-a-half years. Management is wonderful customers are great. Always see familiar faces coming into the store which is always a plus for coming into work. My managers were always fun and kind to their employees treated you like family. I recommend this job as a first-time job for teenagers or college students. Work is not hard very easy always on your feet time goes by very fast. All the weekends can get very busy. Work there over 10 months good way to become part time management.
good,Dollar tree is a fantastic place to work. I had a lot of fun stocking at night time with the other workers. We all got along very well. The manager was also really nice let me work a flexible schedule and also pick up as many extra hours as possible for extra cash. Only thing I dislike was the low pay rate of 7.25 an hour paid every two weeks.  I would recommend it. I also loved meeting and getting acquainted with the regulars when I worked register which was my favorite.
good,Very laid back place to work. I was usually working the cashier and bagging the items. Other than that I would clean up the store. Air up balloons. Greet costumers.
good,Love it well orientated good people customer satisfaction at its best.met alot of ppl everyday was a challenge when doing recovery.doing go backs and prepareing the store for tomorrow.
good,Overall work was a good meet good people manager was horrible learned alto about retail but it sucks that OT was only part time didn't get enough hours to much favoritism
good,"It was a fun little place to work, everyone was friendly and everyone loved me. I only left cause I had a temp position and the store can afford many employees."
good,Fast paced management job that requires a lot of hands-on work. Have to be very successful at handling all aspects of running a store while also getting those hands dirty to get the job done.
good,I had a wonderful experience with dollar tree. The people were great. Only issue with dollar tree is most of it is part time and the pay is minimum wage which doesn't get you very far. Great for people how haven't really worked much and need experience.
good,The Dollar Tree store I work at we are a very team oriented group of employees. we feed off each others motivation. We are like a family! Every store is different I have worked at two and can honestly say that the second store which I am currently working at I wish I would have been working there the entire time I have been with the company!
good,Was actually very lucky to be employed at this company the expansion is great. Store manager at my location was one of the best managers I have had since I first became employed. Very respectful managers but all business which is great.
good,"I love working at dollar tree because its fun, the customers are friendly, and the employees are fun to work with. Its close to my home so I don't have to travel far."
good,"The manager is a great person, fun to work for. Unfortunately the company does not give enough hours for staff to live off of."
good,I had an awesome boss & our store was constantly clean & full. The only thing I didn't care for was you don't really have a life. If someone called in; I had to work for them. No real life; just a lot of working.
good,fun and productive work place.  Here they give new employees the opportunity to advance .do you work at your pace and  interact With customers. Here they don't limit you they help you succeed
good,"short hours, fun and healthy work environment, hard to make time past cause there can be nothing to do at times. management is good and they are always willing to work with you if you need time off. there are always opportunities to move up in the company"
good,"Dollar Tree does not promote within company, there is several issues with management not agreeing with each other but I do enjoy my job and my Manager just want to grow"
good,"I really enjoyed working for this company because as a store manager you get 2 days off per week. However, you still unload truck by hand and with little hours you are expected to keep the shelves full with everything being only $1.00. It is very challenging, because if sales are slow a day you must cut a cashier shift. Plus they lied about my starting salary and would not give it to me in writing."
good,"Fun place to work!  Enjoy the employees.  Need more hours!  Customers are always interesting.  I enjoy my work here.  Enjoy the never ending traffic flow, everyone looking for a bargain."
good,It was good to work with the other employees and seeing the happy faces of the customers as they were taken care of. The hardest part of the job is probably being in a super fast paced environment during the holiday seasons. I learned how to use a register and how to stock shelves appropriately.
good,"My typical day at work was clean, straighten and maintain shelves and displays to project a consistently positive image of the company and handling the cashier."
good,Not bad just don't pay enough money. Overall the job is a nice job to have just to pay a few bills but not to make it a career for the rest of your life.
good,"Good envirenment, staff , and customers  pay could be better but overall a good company with good products at good prices , it is a pretty good store."
good,I love working here. It really is a fun environment and the customers most the time makes it a good time as well. The good ones out way the bad ones you get every so often.
good,"Dollar Tree pays their employees pretty good. The workplace was a friendly and fun environment to work in. I did not have to resign due to medical purposes, I would still work for the company!"
good,"I absoolutely LOVE working here. My store is really fun, the workers are amazing, and everyone has your back no matter what you need."
good,"Typical day was busy, sometimes very fast paced. "
good,Shifts are about 4-5 hours and include checking out customers at the cash register.  Customers love the store and enjoy shopping there.  The hardest part of the job is getting the store organized after a busy shopping day.  The best part is the duration of the shifts.
good,"It was an ok job, poor hours, and communication. "
good,"enjoyed working there just not enough hours no room for advancement, never wanted to let you get alot of hours. management was ok to work for not really any problems with the management"
good,It was okay to work here when people wasnt tripping on a dollar but everything in here is great for the price of a dollar. I really had a great time at work only if I work with the people I liked mostly or if the cuystomers were nice.
good,Working at Dollar Tree is great. Dollar Tree sales all kinds of cool thing and necessary items for daily living. It's a great place to work and shop.
good,"Typical day is receiving vendors, food prep, dinning room prep, and greeting guest, menu orders, and money transactions."
good,Started working here as my first job and liked it a lot. Pretty easy and simple job. Sit at the cashier all day ringing up items. Easy
good,I show people new ways to do things customs loved me  im a good people person I was a manager made sure the work place was friendly an safe.
good,"The days I've worked at Dollar Tree, were some of the best days I have had, and been able to call it work."
good,Nice place to work and I loved working with the customers. Dollar tree has very short shifts and it worked well with my school schedule. The management is great. The store is in a good location and has a bus route available.
good,"Easy place to start off in as a starter job, do your job and all will end well, stay on task and dont stray from the current objective."
good,Good place to work over the holidays. Met a lot of good people. Not much hours in the off season. I don't want to comment any further.
good,"A typical day at work usually consisted of stocking shelves, running cash register, filling balloons etc. I have learned how to use my communication skills better, have better time management, and customers aren't always friendly.Management is good I love working with my managers because the help the time pass by and we get things done faster. I don't have a problem with any of my co-workers but the hardest part of my job is ringing items fast enough to get the customers out the door because you don't want to take to much time. the most enjoyable part about working at Dollar Tree is that everyone is so nice and fun people to be around."
good,"Assisting Employee's and Customers,  Protecting all company assets, Maintain a high level of great customer service, Opening and closing the store.Associate Development, Maximizing Sales Potential ,Controlling Expense and Shrink, Merchandise Display ,Store Signage Placement, Scheduling, recieving and ordering freight. daily emails, seasonal turnovers.Great Management, Helpful dedicated co workers. Hardest  part of my job "
good,Love helping the manager get things done for her and always helping the customers out so they always came back. I would always stock the shelves ring up the customers and always help them out with what ever they needed. the only thing I can say that wasn't enjoyable is making announcements every 10 min or so because u would even have to do that when u had a customer in line other then that I loved working with my co workers and manager.
good,I was seasonal help. I learned a lot of things about handling money and being organized. The managers and co-workers were nice and helpful everyday. the hardest part of the job were being the only cashier and needing help. The most enjoyable part of the job were talking to the customers about anything.
good,I loved working as a cashier.I loved helping customers in person and just helping in general.The other employees were friendly and I would love to work in retail more.
good,"as a sales associate, i was responsible for checking out customers, stocking shelves with merchandise, and sometimes unloading the shipment truck"
good,"A typical work day consisted of numerous tasks and responsibilities that has helped build my work enthusiasm. Although some of the duties were strenuous and time consuming, I enjoyed my job and my co-employees. I am very observant and seek out learning more about the job(s) I'm doing. I work hard and make sure the job is done thoroughly and correct."
good,fun work place the management will always back you up if you make a mistake as long as you are a hard worker and your honest. The management treats you like your part of the family not just an employee
good,I learned how to  use their computer system. Work closely with customers. The most enjoyable thing  about  the place are the co workers and management.
good,A typical day at work would be me either running truck or the register. I'd deal with people all day which I loved.
good,"operated the cash register, received customers payments for their merchandise, gave them their change if there was any and the receipt for their purchase, counted my drawer at the end of my shift, helped customers find what they was looking for, maintained a clean and organised check out area, stocked shelves, put items back on the correct shelf. I learned to deal with all different types of people in a professional manner. Management was good that was there when I worked there but they are no longer there as far as I know. I got along with my coworkers and worked well with them because it was a team effort. I loved everything about that job except for the fact it was only part time and I needed full time."
good,"teamwork, co-workers great, enjoyed working with public, customer service."
good,I enjoy helping people and last thing a customer want is to be halstall when they are shopping and it is my job to make it correct for the customer and help the find what the want.
good,"cleaned and stocked shelves, greeted customers.                              I enjoyed working under the management team.   My co workers were fun to be around I enjoyed meeting new people everyday"
good,Dollar tree is a great job to work at its fun for people who like move allot.  they worked with me showed me how to do thing I didn't know how to do. when the truck came we all had to stock all the boxes and the back of the store. once we done with that we start stocking and the store.
good,"Working for a place for a long period of time you expect to know more. A normal day for me was not like that one bit. I was always at base one because no one thought that I could be good at anything other than basic work. Discussing this with my manager was very difficult because how can someone say you cannot do something if they never give you a chance? My managers excuse was that he didn't think I could handle it and he didn't want to try to find out. After putting all my effort into my job I decided it would be best to not work here any longer. I was above average in my daily sales, floor projects, and work performance. Yet I was never able to do more for the store. I felt like I was being discriminated after I had multiple conversations with my manager about working more and doing more."
good,Cool job i love mingling with the customers and helping them ive learned more patience and personalities the management is ok but alot better i enjoy working with my co workers and truck day is the hardest obstacle but after i hard day and accomplished goals its a great day!
good,This is a great place to work. I was fortunate enough to begin at a store with a knowledgeable manager who would answer all of my questions and give an explanation to why we do things a certain way. I have worked at other stores where it was a difficult environment to work in. Those managers who tried to play the system got caught and the anonymous help line helped a lot!
good,"A typical day consists of clocking in going and finding my manager and seeing whether or not im going to be just stocking and cleaning. Or also running back up on register."
good,A typical day at work would be to handle customer orders. Management at Dollar Tree were excellent to work with. They are all great team players. 
good,This job kept you busy and before you knew it your shift is over. I liked my supervisors they guided me well as to how to work and what to do to complete my job for the day. This company was close together as friends and we worked as a team to help each other out. Sometimes it was fun we would compete to see who could stock the most.
good,"had one the best work places ever!! If i could work for the company i would they were willing to work with you and your scheduale, but did not put up with breaking the rules it was the best job i had."
good,"Dollar Tree of clifton nj is a great place of employment. Coworkers as well as management display a kind and respectful environment. on a daily basis you will learn how to interact with customers as well as coworkers. Also you will gain experience with registers, such as counting your til and managing money transactions. The job is fairly simple after you take your time to do everything right. I can honestly say the only difficulties you may come across is the fast pace of customers."
good,I loved working a Dollar Tree. The customer were great and friendly. Management was easy to work with and provided great direction.
good,"My shift always began with greeting the customers, handling cash and customer transactions, assisting the customers in every way. I kept my work station clean and stocked, as well as, the other work stations, ready for another Cashier. Keeping the front tables stocked and neat was important and helped in sales. My Store Manager, Asst. Managers, and co-workers were all pleasant to work with. Great team players. There was nothing hard about this job at all. I enjoyed working for Dollar Tree. It was a seasonal position, but i worked there longer, a little over a year. I was complimented for my excellent Customer Service, my pleasant and friendly personality. I am a people person and I believe in Customer Service and Satisfaction. Helping, meeting and seeing different people everyday was enjoyable. Fun work place and store."
good,i enjoy going to work. i look forward to helping people find what they need and i enjoy what i do.
good,"A typical day was just sitting at the register ringing up people and handling money and giving them back the right change. I learned a lot from this job, communication skills with people you don't know, how to use a cash register, where things go, and they taught me a lot. Management is pretty good where I work. Co-workers are pretty cool as well, they help people out when they need help. The hardest part of this job I'd say is just trying to find where stuff goes back in the store. The most enjoyable part is just talking/meeting new people and making new friends."
good,"fast paced at times. Loved helping customers, hardest part of this job was the unloading of the truck."

good,"Typical day is helping with customers, running registers, stocking, and cleaning. Loved working with my co-workers. The hardest part was dealing with customers who can be rude. The most enjoyable part was being around a group of people who always seemed willing to help you."
good,Great place to work... great customers service... an a clean an neat environment
good,i do about everything but what the manager does. the co workers are a blast. the hardest part of the job is to get everything looking good and be done by the time we close. the most enjoyable part of the job is we always have fun.

I'm on parole and I'm doing everything he has asked and I would like a change at a better job and move out of my halfway house when I'm ready. Thank u.
good,Good place to work always something to do.  The shifts go by fast because your always doing something moving product putting away products.  The team atmosphere is great you need that to accomplish tasks.
good,"Great company to get started with and continue to grow in your field. Company continues to grow and so does the need for your duties. "
good,Great place to work in as a part time and/or second job. Salary isn’t very good but job is very easy if you’re fast and focused. Management is very flexible with schedule and everyone is super friendly.
good,They are very good flexible company to work for but you cannot climb up the corporate ladder if you have background issues they have great managers there but if you are very people person you will fit along very nicely like myself I get along with all people so I made them feel welcome when they come to our store
good,"Great people, awful company. Many empty promises. The employees/in store mgmt. are all wonderful people, very friendly, helpful, considerate. Corporate and district levels don't care about employees. Dad was in hospital getting a bypass and other coronary concerns, I asked for a delayed shift start so I could be there.""You need to prioritize your life and decide what's more important."" Myparents, obviously."
good,The old Dollar Tree Great Company was actually my first job as an teen on my own away from home i loved it great manager staff and all good job duties expert
good,I wouldn't mind working at another one it wasn't too bad. Definitely have to dress for the different weather because of the location between the doors and the registers in most stores.
good,Dollar tree has friendly workers and respectful. If you are looking for a decent part time Job we are alwayd hiring and open to anyone who can fulfil the job.
good,The manages that I worked with were really nice. They always helped me and told me way I can improve and better myself everyday. I really loved the advice and feedback because I always want to do better with what I do
good,I started off as a stocker and ended up becoming a assistant manager two weeks later where I started opening and closing the store by myself unloading the trucks and stocking cashiering or anything else that needed to be done around the store
good,I have worked for the Dollar tree for almost a year. I love it! I enjoy the customers and management ! My only complaint is I wish I got more hours. Other then that The Dollar Tree is easy going and fun work place!

good,They were a good expirirence to my job career. I had very good co workers and it was a friendly enviro. Overall would highly recommend this job to people who are new at job listings.
good,I didn’t really have a hard part in my job I was good at it I am a fast learning in don’t take me long to get things done in on to the next things in stop helping my team
good,The job is a good second job or a starter job to get experience. I just wish they would offer more hours and pay more then minimum wage. You cant live off 3 days a week.
good,I loved this job but felt after eleven years it was time to move on. My typical day was stocking and helping customers check out or find items they were looking for. I enjoying doing customer service! I learned there are many types of people and they all have different needs. I worked with a good crew of people. We enjoyed being around each other. The hardest part of the job is when I had an elderly customer pass away. The most enjoyable was the kids that I saw each day and interacting with people.
good,I loved coming into work and covering shifts for coworkers I loved doing my job and getting jobs done.  Working there there was always something to stock clean up organize and simply to stay busy.
good,I enjoy working there easy to move up in the company just do the work and know the store be professional and that will take you a long way know what you want out of life
good,"Working at Dollar Tree was the best job I have had. I loved going to work everyday. All of my coworkers were really sweet and welcoming. The work was sometimes challenging but nothing too hard, it was great for being my first job."
good,I like the seeing and helping people grow. The company gives you an opportunity to advance. The hardest part is continuing to train replacements for the ones that move on.
good,I'm a very hard working employee. I learn fast and it takes me no time to catch on to new things. Very out-going very loyal and dependable. Never call in nor late.
good,On the feet job and must HV good organization skills options to work at night or day ( night is best unless you like to sleep at night) always new people to meet and some staff member are in enjoyable to work with
good,I enjoyed working at Dollar tree . It was a fulfilling and very fast paced. I love helping customers as well as keeping the store running smoothly. I was always there when they needed me to cover for another employee when they would call in. I offered to work over time so that a project would be finished on time.
good,I like to walk in and see them and know them by name and talk with them. communication is the key you tell them like it is don't beat it around the bush. I just wish i can have more day's with hours but I am looking for new work. because i Can't afford anything.
good,Great place to work for anyone with disabilities or old. That is my highest recommendation to them. However i didn't like if you excel your job in every area you should definitely get a raise or promotion. I didn't 😭 maybe it was just me though . good luck anyone who works and intends to work there i highly recommend them still
good,"I felt i did m best at setting up the store to be accepted for the job, i knew where things went by the flow chart, accomplished getting over the fear of heights, also, felt better about myself as a potential employee."
good,Store manger is very nice. She is also very understanding. She also keeps the store very clean and neat. She does her job very well. Would recommend people to work here at this Dollar Tree in Lakewood Plaza on Veteran Parkway.
good,The work was not too difficult but did get tiring after some time. Managers were fair and acknowledged the harder working associates and always made sure everyone who deserved more work time got it.
good,"Dollar tree is a fun and pretty easy job. Always getting new product in and always has something for all seasons and holidays. "
good,I enjoyed this job because the day would fly by as I stocked shelves and helped customers when needed. Love working with people. Most enjoyable was the staff and the prices.
good,Good job to work..productive environment...good culture.   There is room for advancement if you work hard.  The one thing i would change is havi g medical benefits for part ti.e employees.
good,"working a regular day it is to keep the store nice and clean and make easy to shop for customers , learning to training managers , team members , and show the company what i know from my other job ,"
good,"I learned customer service skills, how to communicate with customers, stocking, cleaning and getting first hands on new items"
good,Dollar Tree has everything that you would need as far as the knowledge of how the store is ran. If you follow their plan of operation on the tutorials. The store will run very smoothly.
good,"Dollar Tree is a fast paced place to work. The customers are great and so is management. The workplace culture is relaxed, however, there is always something to do. If you have time to lean, you have time to clean. Never a dull moment."
good,I learned a lot with Dollar Store. the have a good workers. There store manager are not the greatest though. But all in all they are a good company to work for
good,"Its a fast pace, fun work place. The job simple but always something to do. The shifts are not that long and most the ppl  u work with are wonderful. Need great customer service skills and be able to lift up to 50 lbs for the freight"
good,A good company to work for when the hours are available. I started out working at least 20 hours and due to the season and other employees my hours were cut to one day a week.
good,The management at Dollar Tree was amazing! They were always very understanding with health needs and time off requests! The manager made all employees feel very welcome.
good,"I love working at Dollar Tree. It’s a flexible job, and I work with some amazing managers and employees. I also love to interact with the customers, so that they feel comfortable to come back and shop with us."
good,"Fun, good team to work with, they work with your schedule time to work, needs management improvement, needs fair treatment with all employees regardless of race, needs opportunities of employees voice to be heard"
good,It was an ok place to work wished I could of stayed longer but left for my children I really enjoyed the environment it was relaxed and the people were polite
good,Its a good work but they pay its not much and they give as many hours as they can and sometimes you dont work ti much or they take outbyour hours and givenitmto other people and they want you to stock cases and do the cashiering and they get mad if u dont do many boxes its hard but for someone that not have kids or any obligations i think its good
good,Although it didn’t pay much I loved the environment. My at the time manager was great! He was very understand and sincere. Most relaxed manager I’ve ever had!!!! Would work there again if salary were higher. Only negative thing it can get backed up and had low back up.
good,Great fast paced work environment. Lots of room to grow and learn skills necessary for customer based employer. Great workplace that becomes fun and exciting with each new day.
good,"It was great working there. I loved the staff and management. You know exactly what is expected of you. Most shoppers were great, but of course some stole because there wasnt enough employees in the store at one time and the store its self is not in the best area. hours are flexible. most available positions are part time. job is easy and fun if you like costumer service."
good,The environment was wonderful my manger was the best one although she was strict she was very understanding and concerned about her employees I would recommend anyone to work at the Dollar Tree locates in lake wales on Hwy 60 VICTORIA IS GREAT!
good,"Everything was great,then we got a new manager and he was great and I was the assistant Manager. Well there was roomers going around that the 2 ladies under were going to try to get me to have to step down and then things started happening and the roomers and gossiping got bad, when we would have our meetings I would tell everyone that if the gossiping does not stop I will find out and you will be fired. well it all got built up and I just told my assistant I was done and quit."
good,Working at Dollar Tree as an overnight stocker I was responsible for organizing dollar tree merchandise for customer purchase. During the evening I also was responsible for helping any customers inquires in regards to the merchandise as well as be knowledgeable of the store.
good,It was an easy job. I usually just sit on cash and scan the items. Occasionally we'd get a crazy customer but that's kind of part of the job description. Great management and employees.
good,"Working at dollar tree was a very positive experience. It was a fantastic place to get a first job at, the other employees were very nice, working conditions were excellent, and the managers were professional yet easy to talk to."
good,"I don't mind working there, and I intend to stay a bit longer, however, unloading the truck was quite stressful and rather boring for an aesthetically inclined individual as myself. I just think it's time for something new, and perhaps full-time. Overall, everything else was fine."
good,"Working with the other co-workers is fun, the only thing that stresses everyone out is the overwhelming amount of customers. Some of us feel more stressed than others, but we all deal with it in our own ways."
good,I love working at dollar Tree but could get more pay and hours and early day time shifts. I know it is a dollar tree and that is not what they do put I wish they would try to work on try to do better
good,A time worth visiting the dollar tree store. The friendly surroundings include the employ's and the custom walk around the store. When fun is work that's works.
good,"Its a fast - paced enviorment very easy to run the stores"
good,"For the most part, this is an enjoyable job. However, after the holidays, the hours are cut severely, from about 20 hours a week to 4 hours a week. The work is easy and the deals are great."
good,It was great for a first time job in that area. However I do not recommend it for anyone looking for a job to support themselves financially. The pay isnt sufficent enough to live off of.
good,"Dollar Tree is a great starting place if you looking for possibly a second job. People could be friendly and some could be very nasty but overall nice place to shop, Can't beat some of the things the have there just for $1."
good,dollar tree is a good store but some of the mangers only care about themselves. Dollar tree comes with alot of extra work some of the mangers just walk around and do nothing...but besides that u will met alot of new people and also get to know alot of different people.
good,"I would come in review the assignment sheet for the day to see what I had to do. Then I would proceed by doing the biggest tasks first. After that it would be time for break, after break I would finish the smaller tasks. Most of the time I did not work enough hours for a lunch, so after I finished I would clock out for the day.The hardest part of my job was unloading a truck, I usually had to do it by myself. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping customers."
good,Dollar Tree is a great place to work I've been there for 7yrs now and I love it there just need more hours but besides that always have fun working the customers are great
good,"i liked it. I felt part a team and learned fast. Not enough payment, reason why i left"
good,Great place to work. Friendly environment. Amazing manager.  Willing to balance home/work scheduled hours.  Very customer service oriented. I would work there again.
good,Other than them just having one cashier seeming to be at the worst time lunchtime and when it's time for people to get off around 4:35 it will get a little crowded and they would only have one cashier which they need to keep two in there at all times because it's a very very fast paced and busy store you have to be quick on your feet and sometimes when you weren't busy if it all you had to do stocking which I don't have a problem with that as well
good,The perfect opportunity to experience a variety of diversity. I enjoyed the exposure and would love to advance in retail in the future. Maybe  even own my own store.
good,"fairly good, quiet place to work. pay should be better, but it's a min. wage job. great managers, good pace. definitely a good job for the summer, builds job experience."
good,"My honest review about working at Dollar Tree was amazing ,of course there was days and times that were though but management was amazing my hours were flexible, except that i had really random schedules and the manager at time was really disorganized and they always had me on call at early morning without calling me ahead of time . Other than that i really enjoyed working there !."
good,"Great store manger, relaxed work environment. Work was fun and it was real difficult. Easy learning what is expected of you. Cheap food for lunch. Consistent work schedule."
good,"Very customer friendly, clean, neat, organized & safe place for all ages. We frequently put all items back that some customers did not want, or couldn’t afford."
good,"Dollar Tree was fast-paced, high traffic volume, customer oriented."
good,"good first time job"
good,I had alot of good times working at dollar general. I didnt really like closing because there is more things that need to be done at night. But i would usually get out at a still pretty decent time.
good,"I enjoy my job and the coworkers ,management, and the customers.  The products are good quality  and affordable. They have a great selection of products. Great for parties!"
good,It was a good place to work to get experience and get promotions. I worked at dollar tree the longest out of all my careers simply because I enjoyed the work and my positions that I held at the company. The only reason for leaving was there was a change in district managers and the management went downhill. I didn't agree with how the store was being run.
good,"great place to work , you just don't get enough hours for the work you are giving . Great low prices. It would be a great job for a teenager first time working on a job,."
good,"On a typical day I go in, count my register, take a couple customers. Then when it slows down, I do go-backs. Most of the management is extremely nice."
good,"I have  been forever, and forever will be a Dollar tree shopper and store employee.   There's never  been a job I enjoyed more. There is no stereotype of shoppers. From richer to poorer  and all in between, everyone loves a great deal ."
good,"I loved the staff where I worked, but the pay was a bit ridiculous considering the work history I had. If I had to retire and wanted something to do and wanted to continue to work, this would be an option."
good,very good place to work at and good pay. i learned a lot working as a cashier and the work culture is good the hardest part is the rush hours.the customer happy faces after saving more here than any other places.
good,Customers were actually kind most of the time. Hours sucked and it was mostly a laid back job. Assistant managers do get to know the associates. The manager was just ignorant half the time but you get used to him.
good,"A good work place, it helped me further expand my previous customer service skills. I also gained knowledge in other areas, multi-tasking is key. I was also attending college while working and they were flexible with me on the schedule. A very busy job that keeps you going."
good,"The job is fast paced, good place to get yourself started in a working environment. Managers are typically easy going, and helpful. This job teaches you how to keep calm under pressure with difficult customers, it feels good when even the difficult customers can be helped finding a product they over look."
good,"Dollar Tree is A very calm work place. Dollar Tree is fast pace so you  have to always be on your P's and Q's. While working at Dollar Tree I have learned to Treat my customers with the up most respect, I learned to handle money properly and appropriately. Managers are pretty easy to work with as long as you do your work. I would say the hardest part of my job is handling rude customers at times. The most enjoyable part of working at Dollar Tree is that you can always have fun with your co-workers."
good,"I enjoy  my job at dollar tree. My main issue is that not enough scheduling hours are given for the amount of work that needs to be completed. Especially stocking hours. For a small store that is. "
good,"Trustworthy, friendly and understanding manager. Other employees were very sweet as well. Hours distributed evenly with other co-workers. Easy to stalk shelves. One of my favorite work places."
good,The work atmosphere was enjoyable to work in. The people were great. The customers were great. Hardest part of the job was the rare computer malfunctions we would have.
good,"Dollar Tree is q great place to work. Being a cashier is so fun. This is a great place to work. Over all fun and wonderful job experience. The staff is great, my manager was amazing. Makes you feel good and appreciated."
good,Loved this workplace. Fast paced especially during the holidays. Great company to work for and I would recommend anyone to work here. Taught me how to have great management skills.
good,This is the first retail job I have had. I have learned a lot about the daily operations of retail. The hardest part of the job is getting everyone on the same page and learning to work together as a team. there is always one or two that can't seem to learn how that works better when all work together.
good,The manager at this location was very nice and friendly also work with the schedule when time was needed off. Co-workers were great at working on the sales floor and helped work around schedule as well.
good,I loved Dollar Tree and the culture behind it. A store where everything is the same price is completely genius . The management was great and I enjoyed going to work everyday.
good,the workers are very positive and helpful towards the costumers and towards other workers. I would not recommend going to work there but would recommend shopping there.
good,"Ive worked there for a little while now for about 2 years. We give awesome customer service, my boss and co workers are motivational and professional to work with, incredible schedule flexibilty. I learn how to work with the customers more and always give a smile to make them feel more welcomed. I wouldnt say there really is a hard part of the job at all. The most enjoyable part of the job is working along side with my co workers and my boss."
good,Fun and nice environment to work in. Management and owner are very involved with their employees always making sure theyre taken care of.very considerate of family life.
good,There was always something to do to keep you busy. Very easy learning register. Trucks were always on time so we could get  the merchandise out on time for the customers
good,i really enjoy working with Dollar Tree.The manger was nice and co workers.i would still been working but i got kidney cancer.And it Kept me from doing my job.
good,WAS ALWAYS BUSY MET SATISFIED CUSTOMERS AND ALSO UNHAPPY ONES. Decent hours got enough breaks had first choice on items shipped in
good,"A typical day at work can be great, especially when working with a great team. The neighborhood the store is located at is very diverse and has so much culture to it."
good,"Normal day at work would be to open/close the store, make bank withdrawls and deposits. Delegated responsibility between employees. maintained stock inventory and displays. Hardest part if the job would be long hours or no off days as a manager. Management was great, I became the assistant store manager after being there for 1 month. Most enjoyable part of the job would have been my customers, I still go by there to check up on old friends, mangers, and customers and even help out from time to time. Corporate business but family environment."
good,Its been great working there I love the people i work with and i love the pay and they work with my hours now that im in school
good,Company constantly changing direction.  Expectations is too high and payroll sucks. Bad work life balance. Only would recommend if this is the last resort
good,wasn't there long but was a good place to work many good people I ended up moving to a higher paying job and had no choice but to give this position up
good,"A typical day at work is very calm and also fast past during times of the day. Every employee is friendly and no one discriminate against each other. The management is very productive and precise that there was never a problem, Customers love the Dollar Tree environment. The hardest part of the job would be having to count large sums of money to be deposit in the bank, I had to be very careful and not lose any profit towards the organization . I enjoyed everything about the job though. I mostly improved on my communication skills witch is very important to me."
good,"Working for Dollar Tree provided me with ground breaking experience and skills I wouldn't have been able to get in any other position I've had in my past. It really allowed for a platform for me to display my work ethic and ability to really lead, make difference set the pace, as well as advance in the ranks."
good,Being a seasonal position at the time i was pregnant i very much enjoyed working with my co workers and meeting new people also giving a hand to customers.
good,A typical day at dollar tree was a day that you wouldn't mind having. Lots of fun also while working together and completing task. A clean nice working environment.
good,"good place only sad it was seasonal"
good,"Whata-burger is a good place to start your work experience. Typical day at work was running up and down with trays and cleaning and assisting customers with their order, my store was very clean and very nicely assisted. Manager complied with school schedule and sick days. Manager was tough at the same time very easy with the workers, he demanded effective work and good customer service. My co-workers where young and very fun to be around. Hardest part of the job was working double shifts and the most enjoyable was being around young people and making new friendships."
good,I wasn't here for to long because this was a job that a took while I was looking for another in my field I enjoyed my time made some good friends
good,looking to making a better work place better for myself and my co workers helping others makes me feel better about myself and those around me try to make it easy and easier
good,"I enjoyed this job very much. Great coworkers, clean fun environment. Products are always organized .I left the job to move home to Louisiana."
good,"fast pace job, Customer service is number one, Working as a team is part of the job, Enjoying the public is a must. Lots of responsibilities required and organizations skills is a must."
good,"Fun work place. wonderful staff members. customers are great. I love Dollar Tree in Euless Tx, I have been working here for 2 years and I love my job. I will hate to leave one day. Dollar tree is the best job I have ever had in retail."
good,My work day started at 7am opening the store. I controlled the scheduling of my employees that opened with me so we began the morning with a meeting expressing ideas on how we can improve the store. We also discussed how I can be a better manager and what my associates believed I lacked in. This started the morning off great to get everyone close and personal to build a family atmosphere. I learned no matter how high or low you are in your field you're not too good to take advice from anyone. Being open about the positive and negative criticisms you become a better person and manager. The hardest part of the job was the TO rate. Spend days training and preparing a group for the position and they would quit or be let go so the store could never find balance. I worked over 70 hours a week just to try and keep the store heading in a positive direction. The most enjoyable part of the job was that me and the store manager were close. We had a great understanding of needed to be done and whoever got to it first just did it.
good,It is a good place to work at.  It is a fast paced environment with great co-workers and flexible hours. A great place for entry level workers.
good,Working at Dollar Tree helped me learn more about how to operate certain machinery. Dollar Tree is a great place for you to work with other employees and it also helps you to be more humbled in the work field.
good,"Checking out customers, bagging merchandise, taking payments, assisting customers locate items, stocking merchandise, inflating balloons, handling exchanges."
good,"The employees were a great team of people to work with.  And we all worked really well  together. We always kept busy, Stocking , cleaning, rearranging, displaying all of our merchandise. Building the new seasonal displays could be trying at times, but the team work we had made it easier, and worth it in the end.  The customers for the most part,  were regulars and we got to know them pretty well. And would give great feed back  on our displays,  or new merchandise.  And occasionally would have great suggestions."
good,"Normal work days "
good,"Loved working here, loved the management and the co workers as well. Always looked forward to going to work. Not  much pay that was my reason for leaving."
good,Fun work place to work during the holidays keeps you busy with all the decorating stocking and customers. Management was good to work with and gave chances to advance. Most enjoyable part of the job was the projects and working with customers to make their holidays ones to remember.
good,"Fun work place, with friendly co-workers. The management team are very flexible with u. Every one helps each other with switching shifts with one another if need be."
good,"Flexible work hours, great starter job with advancement opportunities, great company to work for. Work some nights and weekends."
good,Enjoyed working here but left due to compensation not being equal to responsibilities. Also didn't like working nights or weekends.
good,"Operate cash register in a fast paced environment."
good,"I would come in and count my drawer down, make sure everything is in place to open the store. I ran the register all day and stocked items when I had the chance. I loved working with everyone there and had no problems there."
good,this job was the best it just didn't pay enough and it was part time I was a cashier there and I was a stocker  and I cleaned up the store as  well made bank deposits
good,i stock the shelves. i like it. i cut down card board.i like my co workers. they are nice.. i work early mornings... no weekends
good,I enjoy Dollar Tree the customers are always in great spirits. A typical work day is pretty busy we get tons of customers looking for all sorts of crazy way out items. They always leave in great spirits. Management does the best to their ability at all time. The hardest part about it is the 30 mins to face the store during closing . Most enjoyable is the customers always coming back looking forward to seeing me.
good,The store has a great working environment people are great and i like the laid back managers not always comming around picking out everything u do wrong
good,"I love my job. I love the people I work with. they are amazing. im a cashier so I greet customers, help them with any questions that they needed to be answered and I check them out."
good,"a typical day at Dollar tree was interacting with the customers and running the registers. In the free time I would help stock shelves and do inventory, or help set up pods. "
good,"being int  the top percentage for pushed item"
good,Good hours and once I became management my experience was great.
good,this was a good job for me i loved working with the public everyday.
good,"I work basically everyday ,i was in charge of about 10 to 15 employees and i was always making sure my customer were satisfied with their purchase. I was in charge that my employees had enough money in their register . and customer service was a number one priority i made sure the shelves were full of merchandise."
good,I loved working at Dollar Tree. I got along with my manangers and all my co workers.there was always something that needed to be done so I stayed busy all the time.
good,it was a fun and flexible job while I was completing my degree.
good,I enjoyed working here and they only offer you part time job never full time unless your a manager and hours will get cut if sales are not reached in the store.
good,"A typical day at work is working cash, helping customers, stocking shelves, cleaning the store, depending on shift. My coworkers are friendly and helpful. The hardest part of the job is dealing with angry customers, but the most enjoyable part of the job is making angry customers happy."
good,"Usually look forward to going in to work."
good,"Worked very well. "
good,"A typical day at work for me is very fast paced. I am constantly doing something because there is always so much that needs to be done. I have learned a lot about myself by being a apart of a management team. I have learned to differentiate personal and business, be fair to each employee, and show each one the same amount of respect. Our management team tries very hard to keep everyone on the same page, we try to train each of our employees to be management ready. I love my co-workers. I want each of my employees to feel comfortable around me and for them to know that everyone can do the same responsibility even a manager. The hardest part of my job is the work schedule. I never have set days off, its always hit or miss. However, the most enjoyable part of my job are the customers."
good,"basic retail job..Cashier work/stocking/helping customers."
good,"Taught me great management skills, career building skills and wonderful customer relation skills"
good,A typical day for me at work is bringing out freight from the back room. Setting up displays and end caps on a daily basis.  Making sure we hit our payroll margin.  Love my co workers and they make my job less stressful because they are all there to help out.
good,"it s a fun place ,but it s not a place to really make a career.management needs to communicate better with there employees better and take better care of customers.a truck day is a very tough day because we have to unload 1500 to 1800 pieces of stock."
good,"Nice people to work with "
good,"I enjoyed working there. I enjoyed management, my co-workers and my customers. I enjoyed stocking the product and helping customers when it was needed."
good,"My work day is pretty cool, relaxed and laid back. There is plenty of work to do, but its a calm enviornment, working with nice co-workers and helpful management. To me nothing is hard about my job, because i dont like when workflow stops. That for me causes a great opening for laziness. I love the fact that I have to stock in between cashiering because that keeps me busy."
good,"arriving on time & increase customer satisfaction work well with other"
good,My typical day was filled with laughs and smiles. I've learned that every race loves a bargain. My management was very nice and understanding. My co-workers were my co-workers and we got alone great. There wasn't anything hard about the job. The most enjoyable part was the customers.
good,The best part of my job is how well they work with my school schedule. Their flexible and extremely helpful to me when it comes to managing my job and internship.
good,My work day consists of helping customers with thier purchases and keeping front end clean. My manager is very helpful and teaches me new tasks. I learned how to run product from the truck to the floor and put up product.
good,"waiting on customers, and in between customers stock shelves, clean. management is excellent. i enjoy making the customers smile,and know they had a pleasant experience in our store."
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is helping with customers needs and wants
good,worked there as first job and had great management team. Always offered extra hours and were nice and understanding about my getting a second job. Went back to work seasonal for extra money during the holidays.
good,During a Dollar Tree day you can see customers come in and out with convenient supplies. I learned how to front products and ring up text exempt orders. The managers were friendly and understanding as well the co-workers. The hardest part of the job was ringing bulk orders. On the other hand the environment was very pleasant and clean.
good,"I enjoyed working there. The customers were all pleasant and kind. A typical day for me (in between my duties) would be receiving a joke of the day from one of my regular customers, a new recipe from another customer, and decor questions from another regular customer that would never come in unless I was working. My co-workers that I worked with some were unprofessional and management didn't help much to solve the problem but I endured and continued to do my best work until the professionalism started to lack profusely. My hardest part of the job was leaving all my new friends (customers and co-workers) behind when I voluntarily quit due to financial struggle. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with the good friends that I did have"
good,"always on the move. very fast paced. nice people, never doing the same thing over and over"
good,A typical day at work is always somethingto look forward to thanks to the good humor of fellow workers and each customer.
good,"I like it there so far but u can't ever get anything done cause it do busy all the time. I think it could be alot cleaner and organized but its impossible to keep up with it with the time frame ur given. U get wrote up for stuff u can't control and for everyone sled mistakes which I believe u shouldn't everyone should be held for their own mistakes, the store manager is great made me feel relaxed and she didn't act like s robot. Too many managers tho cuz communication disdosent get passed thru right."
good,I loved the hours I worked from 5am-10am. We come in joke around but get our work done. I've learned by working for dollar tree you have to humble yourself with the customers even though they may be having a bad day and being rude and disrespectful and the end of the day someway somehow I made the customers smile. I miss working with all my co-workers they were there for me when I went through some rough times in my life including the management team. The hardest part of the job was me having to leave because there were not enough hours for me to substain and continue living in my house. The most enjoyable part of the job was when we changed the store over to Dollar Tree Deals and I dressed up as the cartoon character Dora and brought smiles to all the children as well as the adults faces I really enjoyed that. I really miss working for Dollar Tree Store.
good,Check into work and do stretches before we started work. What i learned from this job is that everyone was willing to stop what there doing and help you if u needed help. The management at this workplace was one of the best i ever had to work with. The co-worker was good never about them always about getting the job done. To me there wasn't anything hard about this job willing to take on new challange. The most enjoyable part about the job was that the work place was clean never had to clean up after someone else.
good,a typical day at work was coming in and going straight to work no horse playing was the best part.My shift was over night and it always seem to go very fast. We work at a none stop past my manager was a very down to earth person that made it even better to me there was no hard part I just put my mind to it and got my job done.
good,"I can't say enough good things about my managers. They're really great people. It's only minimum wage, 7.25 an hour but, shrug. I'm happy there and I'm trying to get a second pt job to help because I don't want to leave even though it's not great $$."
good,They only paid minimum wage and were a bit stingy with the hours. I had the night shift so I would make bank deposits with the manager. But overall I loved being a cashier there anyway.
good,"The employees are great team members, great customer service, but hard working and fast pace. They have a great system in place for employees work., and have daily goals."
good,Friendly. Good environment. Flexible hours.Good management. Family friendly and strive for customer satisfaction. A good company to work for and excell in.
good,I enjoy working with a great team and a manager that cares about her team and store. The atmosphere is positive and there’s always something to do so you’re never bored.
good,The best part of my job is dealing with the customers the worst part is having to put all the go backs away that dont belong were they go i also close the store make sure money is correct clean the store then lock up the store
good,The work was hard most days. However i always got through it and went back the scheduled days to work hard and earn the pay I was receiving. The managers were all verry friendly and trustworthy. If you had a question they always had an answer. The other employees were the same way. Happy to help and fun work with.
good,"Customer service was the big focus there, more so specifically because we offered great deals on everything and we lived on our repeat customers. That was key, pleasing not just all our customers but especially our repeat customers."
good,a typical days work i learned a lot from dollar tree was an assistant manager / cashier . manage deposits  counting  out tills with other cashiers very friendly place to work

good,I love working at dollar tree. I have learned so many skills here and have came across so many caring managers that have made me part of who I am today. I started as cashier and 6 months later I was promoted to manger.
good,It was great seeing satisfied customers and making sure  I can help them in any way I can and also build the company we have great products and merchandise in which we have in stock for all different  purposes our store have every that you can possibly think of from home supplies to food ect.....
good,"I like working for dollar tree the staff are friendly, except i call to get my schedule and the boss basically told me that there wasn’t no hours for me, and i wish he would of gave me an heads up so i could of found another job, i think that was very unprofessional"
good,Don’t pay well but fun place to work... I enjoyed my time there and the coworkers were like family ..we all worked well as a team. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

good,Love this place good atmosphere friendly place to work schedule is good hours pay could be better hours are okay just a very good place to work Good good good good place close to home.
good,"It has alot to do with management,I help set up a brand new store n after it was set up no hours at all so I went to another dollar tree that I normally shop at..told an asst.mgr my situation n advised me to talk to his mgr. n found out I was still in the system n got transferred to that store,mgr. is super awesome."
good,I loved working for this company. It was like having a second family. Everyone treated everyone else family. I got to meet lots of new people. I even met some actual Russians. I got to see the same people day to day.
good,I really love working there my co workers where great. I had taken the test for a higher position but had a issue with the manager messing up on the schedule besides that happening I loved the job and wish I could go back
good,"I really enjoy the customer's, they make me feel appreciated. My manager's are all Great. I feel at home working first this store and I've been smiling while working here every since I started."
good,I learned very quickly with the help of the friendly employees and was shown where everything is located and everyone was willing to help in stressing situations
good,I worked with a wonderful group of people I had an outstanding supervisor her social skills were very high I enjoyed her I would work there again if it wasn't for minimum wage
good,"The Dollar Tree is a pleasant place to work, help customers, and shop (can't beat the price!).  The cash registers and item locations are sensible and not overly complicated.  There is always someone available to help if it gets busy or if you haven't fully mastered the more complex or infrequent transaction types.  The managers are on your side and help you to succeed.  I only wish for more hours."
good,Dollar Tree was one of my first jobs. I loved working there but I moved to Oklahoma  and was looking for a job closer to me. The work environment was great and all of the managers treated me well.
good,Loved working with Ms Tracy!  She was/is a great boss and isn’t hard to work for at all as long as you do your job. Very relaxed and laid back job i feel.
good,"Great Job. Love the employees and customers. The most down to earth environment in this area. To greet every customer as they walk in was challenging at first, but then it started to become a plus to see all the smiles throughout the day."
good,Great work environment co workers were nice. Store was very neat and clean. The managers are wonderful people.  A lot of items to purchase. It’s a good part time job
good,"I applied here during my time at college, and was able to easily work around my school schedule. I mostly worked closing shifts, which for the most part included putting away misplaced stock along with cashing out customers. The managers were amazing, and always responded quickly when I needed them."
good,It was a pleasant and friendly place to work.  It was pretty stressful during the Christmas season but we did not lots of help.  I would return to working at Dollar Tree if I could.
good,"I loved working there it was fun , fast paced , friendly "
good,I stocked shelves and unloaded semi trailers.stock manager was awsome but main manager had moments of anxiety and high stress which was then turned to her employees in a very unprofessional way I worked a fulltime job for another company so was not all around a bad job just wish that the manager had less stress on her and hope she is not still under so much stress
good,Not a bad place to work. The people are great granted no matter where you go there will be some problems here and there. The customers aren't hard to deal with either. so that's Always a plus when working. The work was and is easy.
good,Dollar Tree was one of my BEST jobs! The people are super friendly. The customers are the Best! And management usually worked with your personal situations. They understand that life happens to the best of us and always worked with me! The pay is okay for summer jobs or side jobs. Great working environment for Happy and Positive people!
good,"Dollar Tree was a great job, I worked during the Christmas season so It was extremely busy. I was a cashier and I’m a people person so I had a lot of different personalities, and long lines but it was an experience I to do."
good,its a very comfortable work environment where people are very nice. Also the management is also good there. Hours are good and people are friendly and very interacting with me
good,excellent place to work among with others coming together to get a task or task done together with wonderful hr management team. Fast past environment

good,Great place to work. You work hard. Customers are nice. Everyone gets along well with each other. Everyone helps each other. I recommend working at Dollar tree. Great starter job orjobfor part time work.
good,Good Company to work for family friendly great benefits...4 days on three days off. Company going Thur a lean 6 transformation...should be a great place to work when it comes out the other side.
good,"Great job if your looking for part time work. I loved my coworkers and boss but the pay was horrible. If your working already and need a little extra cash then Dollar Tree is perfect. Easy work, little hours perfect fit for a working person or mom who needs part time work."
good,"I think Dollar Tree is a great place to work. The day seemed to go by fast. Enjoyed my fellow co-workers. Hours are flexible."
good,At dollar tree my hard working effort was truly tested. It was tiring but beneficial to valuing my worth as far as a being a hard working person. The only thing that kept me going is the manager and my co-workers.
good,"I first filled out an online application."
good,I love working here and the people I work with. There is nothing hard about the job. I learn new things everyday. You wait on customers and help them find products that they are having a hard time finding.
good,"it is a good experience learning to interact with others, the manager was easy to talk to  & would always try to do everything in your favor, i recommend working there"
good,I loved it here . Willing and trying to go back. There is only some locations that need more security but other than that it is a nice place to work .
good,Very Good Work Atmosphere. Very Organized Always Had Something To Do In  Store Even When Store Would Slow Down With Customers. Either Stocking Items On Sales Floor Or Cleaning The Store And Greeting Customers As They Entered And Offering Any Help They May Need.
good,Only problem I ever had was the hours and the rate of pay everything else were pretty smooth and worked out just fine I would go baxk any day there are very understanding as well
good,"It was great work environment when you have the right staff around you. It was a pleasure working with and meeting, and greeting different customers daily. Not great hours unless your management, but luckily my hard work got me promoted to assistant manager. Still a great place with great deals also."
good,I loved it and enjoyed working around customers wish I didn't have to move or I would've still worked there great costumers. it was nice and clean and everyone got along
good,Dollar Tree is a fine company to work for.  Unfortunately they dont pay enough if ur a single person living on your own.  The hours offered are mostly parttime.
good,It was pretty swell and I enjoyed my time working there. The co-workers were really nice and I was treated with much respect while I worked there for the time being.
good,"As you would expect form a discount stry it was busy."
good,I loved working here. It was a good opportunity with a good work environment. I loved my managers and I acquired tons of skills in customer service and cashiering here. They’re very flexible with hours and understanding. I would reccommend!
good,I really liked working here. They are very supportive of the fact that thier employees are human and have outside lives. Hours are limited but upon advancement they improve. Which advancements are available frequently and they promote based on merit not seniority. I'd work here again in a hart beat.
good,It was my favorite job. Just got rough on me with my hip doing freight. Would go back in a heartbeat. Managers were great! I learned how to stock do freight and cashier.
good,"My experience working for The Dollar Tree was enjoyable, hard-working, and busy. My Co-workers were great people, as well as my store managers. I appreciated them to the fullest. The workplace culture was new for me, however I adapted well, met alot of wonderful people, and my experience of being able to work at 3 other Dollar Trees ( my work was that good, and I was recommended) was great."
good,This is actually a great place to work. Need to have open availability at this place. Scheduling is kind of hectic at times. Friendly environment. Great management.
good,"Wish I could have worked for the company longer... stocking was great and cashiering was fun, got to meet people from all over. Management did a great job training me..."
good,"I must say working for Dollar Tree is a very interesting experience. Although not every location is located in a tough neighborhood, the location I am at is in tough. I must say I drive to meet the mission in providing products for a dollar. Many of these products are better than the name brand ones that are in the big retailers. We at my location are a family and treat all our customers with the same warmth."
good,good friendly people nice atmosphere great management also nice for college students starting off in the work field. Would have been there longer if I didn't relocate.
good,"Was a first job opportunity that helped me learn much about retail environment and experience. "
good,"Nice customers, friendly co-workers,  all in management were awesome.  Had alot of fun there.   the hardest thing was go backs at christmas time most enjoyable all the candy they sell!"
good,"not enough hours , good manager even tho he had his issues, everyone there was really nice, made friends easily, overall good place but sucky hours..."
good,"It was nice to work for Dollar Tree, they have a lot of stores to work in.  "
good,It’s a great place for high school students who need a little extra cash or spending money. It’s full of nice people and perfect for gaining cashier experience.
good,"I loved working for Dollar Tree, trying so hard to work there in my new location."
good,I like my job at Dollar Tree. It can get hectic at times but for the most part it's a relaxed atmosphere. It doesn't pay much but the work performed is really easy.
good,"It's a good place to work for, they offer a great environment and a fun workplace. It's a very relaxed setting and the hours are very flexible and easy to work with."
good,"It is a job environment that requires fast workers, fast learners, and a sociable personality.It can get tough with the customer service due to the wide arrangement of customers."
good,Every workplace needs work on teamwork and always will. This is a great place to work especially if you just want to get a start in management or retail. Excellent opportunity for advancement and the benefits are great though for any kind of bonus you have to push yourself to you limit and beyond for it. If you're willing to do so you will go far here.
good,i like working for this company because there are a bunch of hard working people who give customers a lot of respect and great customer service. but most important always have a smile on there face
good,This was a very fast pace job due to the amount of customers every day. However I loved the fast pace and kept me very busy. It was a good job at the time but I was not able to continue due to a foot operation that had me laid up for 6 months so I was forced to resign.
good,Allowed me to gain experience working with money. I was able to keep active with restocking or organizing the store. The managment was friendly and very helpful.
good,"Fast pace working environment, I learned a lot bout how to run a store the two yrs I've worked there. I was open minded to learning knew things and how to make a great business.. I learn we became family and worked as a Team. I love the people I worked with and my stocking crew I developed at Dollar Tree. Thanks for the opportunity."
good,Nope pay can barely fees you and i was a manager. Constantly long lines and the help is slow to get there if your a cashier. Recovery is a living nighmare and they will work you to death on the stock trucks that come in just so the manager gets a huge promise and you stay at measily 7:35 -8:35 a hour.my opinion not worth it
good,"I was a cashier and enjoyed my time while i was there. We actually put everything from the ground up with the shelfs, then the displays and just how to stock up as well."
good,"I work in the OS department. I label and throw boxes for twelve hours. You have an option between four different shifts to work on. They all have different pay, free health care, and paid breaks if you work more than 8 hours!"
good,"Often busy, never any monotony, diverse and interesting clientele and very nice, supportive store staff/management. "
good,Loved working there. It was a delight getting to know the customers and making the people smile. The boss was fair never was late getting breaks or if had emergency or crisis he would listen and try to help.
good,"Hard work with a fast pace, good people, good management. a typical day you come in clock in and help the last shift finish up then you start your shift by bringing in another trailer then you start loading for the rest of your shift."
good,As assistant manager I would go in and get the drawers ready for the day. Get the freight ready and on the floor in the areas that we were working in that day. Open the store and greet customers. When closing it is the same thing except we ran the nightly deposit to the bank.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is talking and meeting new people. you really get to know other co workers and customers. preparing for the different seasons.
good,"Friendly co-workers and customers. Typically fast paced, we did have our slow times. Cleaning was pretty easy and not too demanding. Management staff was helpful, understanding, and there when needed."
good,At Dollar Tree we got our work done and also kept it fun. We also made sure we greeted every customer that walked in to make sure they felt welcome. We also made sure they was able to find everything they need before they checked out. Working at Dollar Tree has help me become more of a people's person. The management is wonderful but the hardest part of my job was the end of the shift when we left i loved my job. The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing the customers leave happy.
good,"I enjoyed my time at dollar tree, i never really had any problems to be exact."
good,"I loved working for the Dollar Tree. The staff was friendly and in general the customers were great. There was always something to do. this was a fast paced job, but not overwhelming."
good,I enjoyed the quick paced environment that it was at times. We worked as a team to get any job done. If I had a question it was answered thoroughly so I could do my job properly.
good,"I was a good place to work at."
good,Management was cool and understanding to everyday life concerns. The work environment itself was friendly and easygoing. I liked working there but the pay was ridiculous.
good,Loved it. I had flexible hours. Always put in a lot of hours as well. Very fun environment. Never had any problems with any of my coworkers or anything. Would definitely go back.
good,"It was a great place to work. Great for someone who needs part time or a second job. I am on disability so worked wonderful for me. I loved my manager and would go back to work there if I didn't move away. I left on very good terms and was told I was always welcome to come back. "
good,I was always a good hard worker and I ways always nice to the people they were nice to me  I like talking to them all the  time they may me happy to work there
good,"Typical day is helping customers with their items.  Management is great, I enjoy interacting with the customers. The workplace culture is very large range."
good,"Dollar Tree is a fast paced environment during the holidays. The workers are friendly, The manager is understandable about your availability of your hours. There is actually no stress from management. As long as we keep our aisles clean, everything is back in its place by night and we are helping customers. Everything is fine. The only reason i left was because I wanted a full time job and Dollar Tree is just part time."
good,They do have some things to work on such as safety issues and the store being clean. the store kind of smells and things aren't really put in the right place recovery is an issue
good,"Loved working at my store for almost 4 years."
good,Great place to work friendly peaple and steady place time fles. Very organized and keep you busy .. I had reaguler customers ..cant complain just wish it paid weekly
good,it was a fall back job that helped. I worked there after moving Home and losing another job. was an awkward job as well because the manager was creepy.
good,I like working at Dollar Tree. The only reason for me to leave is to have better financial stability for my family. The store manager knows her job and dies it well and even helps you when new things come up.
good,"Very easy for a first time job. Environment was relaxing, coworkers were very friendly and welcoming. Managers were great. Most enjoyable part of my day was greet customers, making sure they found what they needed. Sometimes i would help and stock here and there."
good,i really enjoyed my time here and all my coworkers. werent very flexable with my schedule. i had to quit because i couldnt get nights and weekends off. sometimes short staffed
good,I enjoyed working with everyone and the work was fun and relaxed.  I got to do what I enjoyed when asked I could run the register or work and stock on the floor and then clean up.
good,I have learned many great customer service and sales associate skills at this workplace. I have now a wide range of knowledge about what goes on in the retail world.
good,"a typical day at work is slow but customers are the best about the day. what i learned is you work together. management is great. nothing about the job is hard, it helps you with your mind and strength and the co workers are great too. the most enjoyable part about the job is that everyone becomes family and they stick together as one."
good,the dollar store was amazing the workers were great and there was always something to do like décor for the holidays or just stocking after closing I wish this place was still in business
good,"This job is fun and easy and doesn't ask too much. The pay is very little and you're lucky to get more than 12 hours a week, but the customers are rarely impolite and the management does a good job. You don't see many of your fellow coworkers but when you do it's enjoyable."
good,Worked there for about 10 years.  Great people and good benefits.  I would have stayed until retirement if not for lack of upward mobility.  I would recommend to anyone
good,I love the fast pace environment. Helping out others who need help.
good,"It was honestly quite the experience, I learned quite a lot from my time working at Dollar Tree, expanding my social skills and knowledge in customer service, and had a very fair and kind manager. I've recommended working there to countless friends if they need a good first time job or just a laid-back one in general; there were the occasional bad apples among customers, and I had one assistant manager who let the power get to her head, but all-in-all, I enjoyed my time there."
good,"Great place to work for someone with no experience in retail, first job experience or even looking for a part time job to bring in a second income. Depending on the store and Store Manager the experience can be awesome. With weekly shipments and new products being placed on the shelves you will be surprised that they were only being sold for $1."
good,For experience retail customer service to slow. But someone just starting into retail pace is slow enough for them to learn about customer service how to handle customer
good,A great First job for high school / college students that want to get better in handling money and more work experience. Dollar tree also a good getting better with money .
good,This job doesn’t pay as much but it is easy. I would recommend it for a start kid coming out of high school or someone that needs a easy second job. Great place!
good,Cathy Morris was a great boss who cared immensely for her employees always accommodating as  best she could . Great place for part time work. I'd recommend it to anyone who needs a part time job with a great set of people to work with.
good,"a normal day would consist of handling go-backs, cash register, cleaning, greeting/assisting customers and making announcements over the intercom every 15 mins."
good,"Great place to work  part time to make a little extra money. No benefits for part time employees anymore because of Obama. Dollar used to offer health insurance to part time employees, but not anymore. Great and wonderful co workers."
good,"Working for Dollar Tree was a satisfying experience.  The management was extremely competent, friendly,  and tolerant of all kinds of people and culture. I would recommend this job to anyone and while the pay is not that great, the overall experience more than not often made up for what was lacking in my wallet."
good,"Work place was pleasant  got to socialize with all types of people, for the most part all my coworkers where good to work with, my manager was a little shaky made a couple of comments that could be viewed as racist but she was ok for the most part"
good,"Something i like about my job is that we all know well how to work a a team. When someone is not in the loop, we are able to all get each other on the same  page. We all worked well together."
good,"The Dollar Tree is a good company to work for. I enjoyed my time there, its relatively easy to move up the corporate ladder or advance within the company. The hardest part of the job as with any customer service position is dealing with disgruntled customers. I learned a lot about myself within the two years i worked for Dollar Tree and I also grew a lot as a person. As for management I do not have much to say, the store I worked for went through them like a child goes through candy. Like i said each store and each experience will all be different."
good,I started as a cashier and within a year got the opportunity to be part time assistant manager for the first time. I loved it. Then maybe a year or two got promoted to fulltime assistant. It was a great experience.
good,I love working for Dollar Tree. It is a great entry-level job for anyone over the age of 18. They are great with managing around difficult schedules like mine.
good,"I grew up going to the Dollar Tree as kid and i loved it. Everyone was super nice and a couple of the managers were very kind and helpful. It's a very productive place so your always moving and on your feet. You are giving a list of things to do during your time of work, your coworkers are very nice and helpful. you get stuff done as a team or individually. its a very easy great first job for those with little experience or no experience and I'd love to be an employer for dollar tree again."
good,I enjoy my coworkers and most of my managers. My only issue is the low pay and the smapp amount of hours they give. This is a great first job for someone still in school.
good,"Stock things at register,wait on customers,take care of reshops, try not to make customers wait to check out long. That I liked doing different things throughout the day. Willing to work with you and not stay in office all the time. The job really wasn't hard just had to really want to work. Having the job and getting along with everyone I worked with it was very laid back we helped each other. Very team oriented."
good,Fun place to work nice supervisor cheap snacks everything is a 1 only thing is fast paced so get ready to move and be focus.pay is good also benefits and paid  time off
good,Management was fair and flexible. Job advancement was steadily available for those seeking title advancement. Scheduling and pay was good. Work environment was friendly and coworkers were team players.
good,Check out customers in a timely manner. Answer to any customers needs. Be accurate with counting money and scanning products. Flexible with hours. Very basic
good,I know I could always go back if I needed to. Never left on bad terms. The worst times of the year there were Christmas and Thanks giving. The customers were rude at times.
good,A typical day at the dollar tree is unloading at least 3 u-boats a day the employees help each other out. i learned  the art of logging and categorizing and merchandising.
good,Ring up customers help take grocery to customers car and restock shelves also do go backs and clean the front of the Store also at the end of the day help manager count the safe make sure inch Register has 100 and out
good,"You have projects  that needs to be done before end of work day, management  will give you your tasks."
good,"Fast paced, easy going, great work environment. Management was understanding, flexible and willing to help with anything you had questions about. The hardest part was being fast and efficient when there was a long line and people complaining. The easiest part was putting things back where they belong when they were found out of place."
good,I really enjoyed working there. My manager was nice and very understanding all the time. I loved my regular customers. The work was easy and relaxed..
good,"over all working for the dollar tree is fun and productive. every one I work with tries to be a team player and help out where help is needed. The hours are only part time and they pay is minimum wage. great first job to start out in,"
good,This job was the best job i have had so far. everyone worked with one another and helped one another. the management was very understanding and very compassionate to thier employees
good,"Really enjoyed working with most of the people. Will really miss them. Unloaded trucks, stocked, cashier a little, whatever they needed. The store manager works with her employees as much as possible when she could spear them."
good,its a great store with good staff. i would recommend my friends to work at this store. Some staff members are great espeacially fernanda and sabira. its awesome.
good,I love working and at the place. It's crazy busy all the time in season and out of season it's none stop.boss is amazing as well.. I have no complaints what so ever
good,"My typical day starts at 5am.  Management is awesome, very willing to work with employees as long as the employee puts in effort. I love my job, and enjoy the team and the pace."
good,"A fun,friendly and productive environment to work in. Management were fare and friendly and always willing to work with employees. My coworkers were also friendly and productive to work with"
good,My typical work day would start with me coming in before opening Stocking and straighten up the shelf's. Then once its time to open i would count my register unlock the doors as im running the register for the day i would announce daily/weekly sale and we also had a sale drive an item we push to sale for the day. This all happens while making sure you keep your area clean. Management was nice understanding and always available.
good,I would run the cash register and greet customers with a smile. I learned that you have to be a team to get things done. The hardest thing about my job was that some of the customers would be rude ut I wouldn't let it get to me.
good,Management is great. Customers are nice. Always something to do. Sometimes it's slow paced and sometimes it's extremely busy but you always get your breaks and lunches.
good,A typical day is either operating a cash register or stocking usually the shifts are 4 hours a day.  I've learned a lot about retail and sales since at Dollar Tree. The management is great you couldn't ask for any better. The hardest part of the job is unloading our freight trucks but only stock crews do that. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to interact with customers and try to help them all you can.
good,"Great place for college students or young adults. Harder for older people, hard on the feet. If you have good shoes and good feet then you will do great."
good,Directly responsible for handling money and the accountability of my cash drawer at the beginning and end of every shift.  During my work day I rang up items and bagged them.  If I identified shoplifters I immediately notified my manager.  I utilized my customer service skills and was always kind and courteous to the shoppers.  I repeatedly was awarded “Cashier of the Week” and also received “Cashier of the Year”.
good,it can be a ok place to work if you have a good team to work with.Some times it could be stressful when shipments don't arrive on time.what i liked about working in retail was the customers.
good,At Dollar Tree I enjoyed cashiering a lot. I liked the quick pace and bagging the items. There were plenty of things to stay busy and never get bored.
good,"it was not a hard job,i really enjoyed the customers and the work load kept me busy it was just not enough team work and communication from the store manager.i know my customers miss me because i miss them dearly!"
good,I worked for the Dollar Tree in Quincy MA run by a lovely woman who made the day fun and exciting but still insured we gave quality work. The store was smaller but one of the busier stores in the area so it was often times messier which forced us to work a lot harder to keep up with demand. I still loved the job despite the hard work and because of all that hard work promotions were much more common.
good,The typical day  there is enjoyable and easy going. Most of the time it was just people from around the corner playing bingo and getting a quick snack between rounds.
good,I never really believed dollar was adored so much until I started working here back in 2012. People would literally come in and spend hundreds on items to make their home look good or to detail their vehicle.
good,"Dollar tree was a good experience, the training that was provided was really nice and easy not complicated. Learning the cash was easy, always had good customer service and always worked with a smile and positive attitude"
good,there is always something to do never a time for a dull moment in this store.from the managers down to your co workers every one is friendly uo beat and a joy to work with.
good,"My time at Dollar Tree taught me how to be productive, value my time and work a register. They taught me how to handle rude customers & answer their questions."
good,Recommend anyone to work there if they love customer service. Very easy job to learn. And will stay busy. They could give pay raises sometimes. Overall love the job.
good,I enjoyed working with dollar tree for the time that I was with them I wish it was a full time job and I would liked to have been able to work full 8 hour shifts instead of the short 5 hour shifts that they provide Not much room for growth  and or advancement in the work place leaving you with not much room to improve.
good,Very fun place to work. Quick pace at times. Great for starters or graduates.  I would recommend this job to anyone. Its the easiest job i have ever worked.
good,"Be on thime to work, i learnd to be a good cashier. And how to stock the shelves. My favorite part of my job is get to know the people that came in on a daily basis and all the coworkers. The hardest part was getting it down to go fast and in a timely manor the first day or two. My manager was awesome she was nice but she was tough and made sure you did your job and always had things to keep u busy if the store was slow."
good,"The job was great. The manager was a sexist pig. As long as I didn't have to work with him. The day was great. Hours were good pay was okay, for a dollar store it was great."
good,"As a store manager for Dollar Tree, expect to be asked to do a lot and expect little tools to complete it. The people there are excellent- every member of management at that company I met were friendly, down to earth, and hardworking people."
good,"A typical day at work is showing up, clocking in, and counting my drawer with a machine that counts it all for me. Then I ring up customers as they come through and straighten shelves. They don't drug test, don't do background checks, and you don't have to have a GED or diploma."
good,My mangers always had respect for each other as for cashiers we worked together as a team and when we need something or help they we're never quick to judge.
good,Really enjoy working here. I recomend anyone who's looking for a place that is flexable to join the dollar tree corporation!! The part time employers dont get paid that much but it's still a very team oriented company!!
good,Great Friendly People. Highly recommended To many people. Would love to Go back and Work. ☺ fast pase friendly customers. Nice Clean environment very cheap prices ❤
good,"I enjoy greeting each and every customer, putting away restock, stocking the inventory ,maintaining lines ,phone calls and cash registers. Helping each customer find the items they want or need."
good,"I liked this job I worked more by my self ,I learned  that you can't be friends with everyone or trust every one especially your coworker's you just gotta do your best at what you do. The most enjoyable part was stocking ."
good,Loved working and seeing new people every day. the prices are low and they have good product and goods. very clean stores. something in there for any holiday
good,"My typical day at work is counting the drawers and filling the impulse at the cashiers right away in the morning. I stock the boxes that are for the checkouts, candy, makeup, hair products, and glass figures. I work with customers and if they ask questions you answer and show them where the product is. Clean the windows and doors, put together containers and cups. When I'm done with work I count my drawer and sign then I go put my go backs away and then I punch out. "
good,This was a good place to work. Had great managers and co-workers. I loved being able to work with the public. The store focused on the customers having satisfactory experiences that would keep bring them back time after time.
good,Dollar tree was a fun and interesting place to work with decent pay and benefits. I was provided advancement opportunities quickly and loved my job. Coworkers became like family and made stressful situations bearable. This job provided me with long lasting skills and relationships.
good,"Dollar Tree offers a strong management team that really looks out for their employees. I felt very comfortable working for Dollar Tree and if given the opportunity to work there again, I would jump at the chance."
good,"This is a fast paced job with many responsibilities, lots of multi-tasking, and setting priorities in order to complete tasks on schedule. There were many hours spent at this store and lots of hard work. My team and I brought the store from 14th in the district to 1st within two months. The best part of the job was being able to look at what you had accomplished in the day, weeks, and months. The hardest part was dealing with some of the customers who wanted to be nasty to my employees."
good,"Lots of  hours just not a set schedule and very hard to work around. Lots of friendly people and plenty to do to keep me busy, love the environment just  doesnt work well with my schedule"
good,Great customers. Managers are good. Good way to learn things if this is your 1st job far as customer service and production
good,Great place to start in any positions. They teach and help you learn how to mange anything. Great people team players. Good pay.  When holidays comes they try to give you more hours. They work with you as much as they can.
good,I think they should start doing tips because they don't pay enough for being there a bi weekly job. The people you work with are very nice and very helpful if your a newbie lol I remember then days coming in and not knowing what to do with my register. I feel like we should also get longer brakes and be able to work more hours than what they give because at two weeks your barely making enough to pay a cable bill realistically these are just my opinions but maybe they help to make a difference in what I'm saying here
good,"A typical work day was very simple, came in opened the store counted the safe and tils.  Turned on all the registers and walked the store to make sure it was clean and ready to open up.  I learned a lot of things, such as making schedules doing weekly numbers, and how to stock and unload the truck properly.   As well as managing cashiers and my freight workers to insure the store ran well.  To me there really wasn't a hard part of the job because I loved just about everything that I did while employed.  The most enjoyable part of the job would be helping customers and running my register and seeing the customer happy."
good,I enjoyed working at Dollar Tree. It was always different everyday and there was always something new coming in. I also liked the people I worked with
good,"i loved working at dollar tree as a seasonal worker. it was an amazing place to work, with very friendly co-workers. i would've stayed if more then 15 hours a week were offered."
good,I run the cash register while stocking a variety of product. I have learned how to work efficiently at a fast pace. The management team is an awesome group of people that I respect and also get along with well. My co-workers are a great group of people who interact well with me and each other. The hardest part of the job is just staying on top of the stocking while keeping the line at the register going. Some days are busier than others which just results in less stock being put out that particular day.
good,"It's a good place to work dealing with different customers attitudes and issues, that's what makes it interesting. And it feels good when a customer is satisfied."
good,"I was always having a good time eith the people that came in, only bad thing was the manager that was always cussing during work hours ith customers in."

good,You can call and ask to Speak with Kelly. Also you can talk to Ted. I really love this job and i hope to be there a long time the job require us to help keep the store clean. All the customers love me to.
good,"I love the people I work with, they really are my second family. They encourage growth in the company and are extremely friendly. Nice environment to work in and there is always something to do. I love the company and their products. Short shifts are available such as 4-5 hrs. Long shifts may be 8 or more hours. The hardest part of the job includes big product shipments and few stocking hours to move the product from the stock room to the floor."
good,"As coworkers at dollar tree we worked together and loved each other.We come in each morning and work on our duties and an worker at dollar tree.I learned everyday about her products,our customers and many more.My manager was a great and sweet lady she loved any and everyone and also work with us as a team to keep our store in order.My coworkers were also so sweet and very helpful and loved there job.We worked together as a team in every activity,we was there for each other in a time of need and many more we were and are more then coworkers.The hargest part of working for dollar tree is some of the rude customers but we always seem to calm and make customers happy and stay happy at all times.The most enjoying part of working with dollar tree is being able to meet new people and enjoy each other company."
good,"Management was wonderful, very understanding staff, enjoyed greeting customers as they entered the store and helping them find what they needed"
good,"A typical day at work included a lot of organization and multitasking. You had to be prepared to help someone at all times and had to make sure the store was near spotless. I learned very quickly how the appearance of a store affects the sales of the store. I was told multiple times that we had the cleanest store in a 30 mile radius. My manager, though strict, was a good man. He was strict for a reason, and in doing so he kept a well maintained and successful store. A mean boss is a good boss. The hardest pert of the job was dealing with difficult customers, mainly because of the typography of the people who commonly shop at the Dollar Tree. I did enjoy most of the regulars however, as not everyone was a completely rude"
good,a typical day at dollar tree consists of stocking coolers and maintaing you work space. There are alot of different personalites that come through the door and you need to suit to each one.
good,I loved working at dollar tree it was a very fun environment everyday just for it to be work.I loved the customers and the positive energy around me I never actually had a hard part involving my job .The most enjoyable part was being about to make others laugh and put a smile on my customers faces .
good,"The company was very supportive of personal goal and helped anyone advance within the company if desired and qualified. The job being in such a rural area did require a lot of personal time as well as effort to keep staff turn around rate low, but the company was very supportive and patient with my efforts towards the specific location. I was relocated a few times to help other stores which i was perfectly okay with and liked being able to travel between locations. The training provided to run a store was very informative and detailed. This company helped me get where i am today and the people working there are amazing and helpful, they really make you feel like part of the family."
good,A great place to work non stop stocking. Full shelves bring in sales. It requires a lot of hours to be successful. The best part of the job is the ability to be creative with merchandising.
good,"Atypical day would be cashiering, helping stock shelves, and doing whatever is on your task sheet for the day. It may consist of cleaning to recovering. The management is super understand and helpful. There is nothing hard about this job at all. I enjoyed working here very much"
good,enjoy the people I work with feel I improved store condition and controlled inventory meet the v. p. had great inventories
good,Typical day at work Walk in and start stocking and picking up after people. Multi task with stocking and packaging gifts for holidays. Go out to receive new merchandise and lift 70 pound objects to the inside store.
good,The pay is too low and I feel my talents are beneficial to another company.  There was no place for advancement in this field.  And the turn around of employees are too much.
good,Working at Dollar Tree was a great experience. All of my co-workers was hard worker. The most enjoyable part was the customers and seeing the big smile as they walk in and out the store
good,"Although I really enjoy my position, I feel that for the work demanded the pay does not reflect the importance of the position.  It really should be a salaried position.  Full time is 35-40 hours and most managers schedule you for the minimum allowed.  If this were a salaried position, you would be able to accomplish all of the requirements of the position, but being limited to 35 hours a week for the most part makes the position very difficult.  Management can be dismissive when there are issues at hand and some even sweep things under the carpet."
good,"Stock Clerk on over night shift. My job experience included controlling Expense, Shrink Merchandise Display, and Store Signage Placement. I also have big box experience, strong productivity in freight processing. Experienced in strong communication. Interpersonal and written skills. I have the ability to work in a high energy team environment. Also used a jack pellet and did cardboard bundling."
good,"Working for Dollar Tree proved to be a great experience. Not only did it bring a higher standard to it's workforce, but also a fun and loving atmosphere. The work was hard and fast-paced, but as a new-found family between coworkers, work wasn't considered work but rather time to enjoy helping customers and the company grow."
good,"one of my easier jobs for sure, all i needed to do was put stuff back. the store is small enough for you to do all you need to do in the four hours of your shift. I loved working here because i would always finish early and would just mess around the last thirty minutes talking and joking around with my co workers. best summer job ever!!"
good,At the start of my shift and end of my shift I must count my till. I've learned to stock merchandise in aisles and in shelves. I've learned to work their register and fill Mylar balloons. I get to greet customers. My management team is great. They are always willing to lend a helping hand. My co-workers are awesome. The most enjoyable  part of the job is meeting new people and being helpful.
good,I learned a lot here and went from a stocker to an assistant manager. Only left because I wanted to go to school and get into the health care field
good,"Dollar Tree was a really enjoyable environment, the customers were always happy to get such great deals. Management was always willing to help in any way, co-workers were fun, friendly people, and I learned that no matter what, the store was always a nice environment. The most difficult part was standing for prolonged periods, the most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with all of the people, some of which became friends."
good,"I just came in and clocked in like any other job. Learned how to work the register. Everyone was very patient and helpful. The hardest times were the holidays,cleaning after customers. The best part was making each customer feel welcomed. The best part was clocking out and saying goodbye to my co-workers."
good,Ill come into work and perform a cash count and then began my shift. I learn about different products that the store has and that gives me better knowledge and sales. our managers hold meetings every week to give us a heads up on promotions and upcoming sales events. my co' workers and I work as a team and the hardiest part of the job is working back office machine but I loved the job because of the people I worked with.

good,"I like working with the public."
good,"Duties included stocking shelves, cleaning, cashiering and welcoming customers daily."
good,love this company and place to work. I have a sore arm and my boss is very thoughtful. He always makes sure I am comfortable at my work load. I enjoy all the staff and customers.

good,"Go to work ready. Get your till at the amount needed. Take to a register. Start talking and ringing up customers with the best customer service. Ask them if they found everything they needed. Work with co-workers to get the job done as a team in all areas to customer service, maintain the store and retrieve and stock store items."
good,"I performed basic cashier duties, as well as stocking merchandise, and assuring the store has been maintained throughout the day."
good,"A typical day at 3-9. Go into work start duties (cleaning, organizing, and cashiering). Towards the end of the night (vacuum, clean bathrooms).

good,I have had several managers at my location that have worked with me as far as a flexible scedule. They are very understanding.

My location has friendly customers as well so its a nice comfortable environment.

good,"Dollar Tree was a fun and great place to work. I was able to meet all types of life. On a daily basis, I was able to meet ant talk with over 200 persons in one day. It was a wonderful experience because those customers are what makes the store progress. I learned a lot from customers as well as staff. My co-workers and myself got along pretty well regardless of the pitfalls and obstacles. The only thing hard about the job was receiving product in on trucks on a busy day with one or two stockers."
good,"Working at Dollar Tree made me realize what customer service is all about, from greeting the customers as soon as they enter the store to helping them find what they looking for all well keeping a smile on their face and mine.

good,"Nothing to difficult here. This had to be the easiest cashier job I've ever had. The most difficult thing to deal with was customers attempting to get more change than they had coming to them. The management was extra friendly, even when they weren't in the best mood. They were very helpful, without being rude. My fellow cashiers were easy to get along with and easy to talk to. The thing i liked best was not having to go anywhere to go budget shopping after work, as everything in the store is one dollar or less. I figured out that a Dollar Tree cashier job is simple, and nearly stress-free. A day there included counting my till at the beginning and end of shifts, ringing up orders, helping customers, stocking, front-facing, relocating misplaced items and vacuuming the floor. All together a great place to work for just about anyone."

good,The best job I've ever had by far I love this place!! Almost every one will take the time to get to know you as more than just a worker and its nice to know that you can vent to ure employees and get to know them for more then just another worker.
good,The job is easy I was a cashier and when there was no customers we have to stock close by our register. Sometimes on Friday I helped with unloading the truck and sometimes it was hard for me only because it's hard for me to lift over 40 lbs. I liked the management and the workers . Everyone is nice and fair. The only things I did not like is they only hire part time so you work 4 or 5 hours in a day so no benefits. If you really don't have bills then it's a great job
good,"The management was exceptional.  A typical day, I dealt with many customers.  I was cashier as well as stocking.  I leaned to check customers out.  I was responsible for sales with and counting money at the end of the day.  I put the money in an zipper bag to the night deposit."
good,"Love working with this company!!Fun,fast paced and easy to learn! Fun environment and fun things always available for assoc to participate in!The holidays are especially fun time to work there!"
good,"A typical day at work included facing and returning products to the shelf, checking the store, cleaning, helping costumers and being a cashier. I learned a lot from this job and it really drilled time management into my head. The biggest thing I will take away from this job is to be at least fifteen minutes early to EVERY shift and as soon as you know you're going to be late, even if it is by a couple of minutes, you need to let the manager working know as soon as possible. The management was amazing there, we had several managers and each taught me a different lesson. What surprised me the most was how busy the store would get randomly and it always reminded me to keep my head on a swivel to stay updated with everything happening in the store. This job was very easy-going and all of the workers and costumers were super nice making it a very enjoyable workplace. The hardest part for me since it was my first job was getting there on time with extracurriculars but that is why I learned that it is so important to always be early. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with different people and making small talk with customers as they check out."
good,Dollar tree was a great place to work . Taught me the skills I needed to become a good employ! Management is very understanding and works hard to create a wonderful work environment for their employees.
good,I enjoyed working at Dollar Tree it was a good experience. I learnt communication skills and money handling skills. I worked their for a year and it was great.
good,"The stors is usually small which allows staff and managers to get their requirements done, the busiest hours are very obvious, so knowing when to time manage your projects is very clear."
good,"Because all merchandise is one dollar, it was easy to flex product based upon the item demand.  The only full time positions available would be the store manager and the primary assistant manager. All remaining positions are part time and available working hours is based on store sales."
good,"Steady work environment, receive a list from my manager of all the tasks that need to be done before my shift is over. Stock up every morning and make sure the store looks presentable, greet all my costumer and make sure they found everything they were looking for. Learned that multitasking is really beneficial when store hours get busy. Favorite part of my job is greeting my costumers and knowing the help that I provided left them satisfied."
good,I enjoy so much working for this company. If all employees think teem work everything gets done and store looks great. Depending on your employees you will feel as family.
good,It was a good experience that i can take on to another job and use what i learn from dollar tree to succeed at another job/career. It was a great learning experience
good,"There is always something to do, new people to meet. Sometimes you run cashier, unload truck, stock shelf's, help customers find what there looking for"
good,Dollar tree is a good place to work if u are looking for a part time job. The company is a good company to work for. They care for their employees. They have good benefits.
good,got to be able to work with alot of customers there i enjoyed my regulars they were the best i liked cleaning the areas that we were assigned and loved fixing anything that needed to be fixed
good,Was cashier stalker front face items clean store count money cool job. Sometimes I would put away Freight unload semis with rollers into are back stockroom very small area but it work

good,I liked working at dollar tree. It offer another opportunity to moved forward in sales associate opportunities. I would love to get another opportunity working in a career like that.
good,"I loved working for Dollar Tree! I loved the my managers,my coworkers,and the work was nothing to me. We had many workers leave because of one manager"
good,managers and employees are very helpful and freindly loved working for the dollar tree would even go back to work there again. definently recomend it as a place to work
good,I would recommend this job to those who need it for college money or a mom to help with little expenses. The most hours you would get at the particular location was 25 hours no one was full time except management.
good,"Dollar tree , is great stable job but as time goes I will like to build my career and find something more interesting for me with better hours and pay with benefits."
good,Love the people amd hours lots of multitasking so keeps you moving around.Manager very nice amd helpful. Customers are nice also and pay is nice can e a lilttle more flexible.
good,"I loved my job. Great manager and other employees. No drama. Fun to see what comes in to the store. Was part-time but if that's what your looking for, I recommend it."
good,I like it but don't Know if others would its kinda good to me but you won't get paid good and it's not fun you get in trouble just for not helping another person if you work at the cashier if you help a person you're in trouble
good,This job comes with alot of hard work and inconsistent hours away from your family never a set schedule for anyone and alot of late hours on your feet alot
good,"Fast paced.  Always something to do, whether its helping customers or stocking and cleaning.  I enjoyed working with the public.  I liked the fact that you were always busy, making the shift seem to go by faster!"
good,Dollar tree taught me a lot about working with people and customer service. How to manage employees and customers in the proper way and how to run a fast paced retail facility.
good,"I am still currently working at the Dollar Tree and my boss is always teaching me something new , you are always moving and doing something to keep going"
good,"sign in, get till and put in your station, put your station in order or clean, try to put products on the shelves and/or sorting out items to be returned to shelves (recovery). Help customers to find what they are looking for in the store. Cashiering here is a very relaxed atmosphere.  Hardest part of the job is putting things away after the are left all over the store. I enjoyed being in a store that had so many interesting items."
good,"It’s a really good place surrounded by good helping people. A good organization, the store has good qualities and is very easy to get the hang of I think this is a good store/company for people to work at."
good,"I have learned from working retail that people are difficult, customers come in the store with attitudes and want to project them onto the cashiers."
good,"I love my job at dollar tree. Yes, its retail, so of course their will be aspects of it that you will not like or agree with. But Ive been through 3 managers so far in 1 1/2 years. If you have a great store manager, you will do great, if you don't, you will feel like a irregular puzzle piece.It also depends on how your DM treats you.  Sometimes they can be a hard one to work for but they do it to help you grow. I'm staying here...DT is now in the Forbes top 100 businesses and if your an store manager or a asm, you can buy stock. If you want a good environment to grow as a person and you are okay being around a bunch of people all the time, its a good place to be."
good,"Since this was my first official job they took their time to teach me how to use the cashier and how to handle money , as soon as it gets full you might freak out but it's okay people understand & you get to meet new people ! But pay is poor I made almost 200 every 2 week's ."
good,"Dollar is a nice, fun job. I just think it's a stable job and maybe until you find a better role somewhere else or bigger. The company is fine, that is all."
good,"Great room for advancement,  let you manage your associates, takes management and associate ideas. Lot of advance technology taking place, some of the best folks to work with."
good,"A typical day at Dollar Tree involves stocking shelves, helping customers find what they're looking for and cashing them out. "
good,"I learned a lot working there "
good,Easy place to work at. Nothing but good people. Easy enough for a first job. Not enough pay for me personally. Managers are easy going and nice enough to work with
good,I would always love to get to work early as well as stay if anyone needed extra hands. I enjoy the work environment because it was very friendly. I will love to continue my career at dollar tree.
good,"Working at dollar tree was a fulfilling experience, the hours were descent and the staff was like a family. I climbed the staff ladder and began to train good performing employees that provided great service to customers. I volunteered to pick up extra hours and help co-workers by taking shifts if they had an emergency. And as did they do for me. Learning to count inventory and place store orders became second nature as did stocking and arranging store items around to different isles. I took pride in my job and I respect all my former co-workers."
good,"Privilege to work there,great manager, supervisors would sork there again if more hours were giving but it was a great first experience working at a store"
good,"Very relaxed, either on register, stocking shelves, or cleaning the store, management is great. Very flexible. Loved working here I would recommend it to anyone."
good,"the time goes by really fast, the people are interesting. I like that"
good,"Dollar tree was a fun place to work at, everyone was nice and friendly. The manager was very understanding of my school schedule. It was a very easy place to work at."
good,"The New Milford, CT dollar tree is an excellent place to work. As someone who has had previous retail experience, it was a breeze to get accustomed to the duties of the store. Most of the shoppers and all of the employees and management here are very good to me and very kind. It can be slow paced except for the holidays where it starts to pick up. The holidays can be stressful but it is manageable. Otherwise, it is a very laid back environment where you can get along with everyone very easily and the managers are very supportive and understanding. The tasks are very simple, you are mostly left to find things to do on your own. You will rarely be asked to do anything as you are expected to complete your checklist of duties and find other tasks if you have none. There are opportunities for advancement if you show the initiative. The only downside is that there are not any benefits to part time workers. I can easily say this is the best job I have ever worked at, and this is coming from someone who has had crummy experiences with previous retail stores. Would highly recommend this place to work at to anyone, including college students who are looking for a part time job."
good,"I enjoy working with the company and the workers at my store my managers was always helpful and mindful of others They work with you when it came to hours and time. And my coworkers were very nice and the customers were very friendly..they like the store cleanse and the workers politeness. I enjoy seeing the smile on they face  when they come through the door."
good,"I went in on time everytime. I'd clock in and put in my numbers to the cashier and start scanning customers merchandise and take care of returns and exchanges. If it was not busy, I would fix up my lane and put back things that customers would not want."
good,"Very good company to work for. great work hours. busy fasy inviorment. willing to work with you on multiple things such as work sceduele  they work with your need, i would recomment this to multiple peole if i ntrsted in working here"
good,"Many of the people who had come in, would always be back the following day to grab something they didn't need and was always coming in to say hi to the staff. I loved working there~"
good,"The job isn't all that good, it would be a good job for a High School study or college student with no bills, but an adult could barely live off the money you make as a sales associate."
good,"Working at Dollar Tree is very fun and keep every employee on there toes. It does teach each employee that there is always something to do. However, it tend to become stressful when it comes to customers who don't realize that everything in the store besides food items has taxes on them. The employee relationships are what make working at Dollar tree a blast and a motivation to come into work and have your game face on."
good,I do not really remember a whole lot about dollar tree distribution because it has been over ten plus years since I have had employment at that facility
good,"fast paced job that i enjoyed it"
good,Everyone knows when u apply for dollar tree it's an seasonal position but when your coworkers dont come to work and they are short staffed when it's time for you to get off can you work but when they feel your going over oh you off tomorrow or csn you can come in a little bit later but why show I have to change schedule to accommodate their needs but when I'm doing my shift amd everybody elses shift but you wanna know why i say no .going home because I'm getting the bitter end of the stick
good,Working at Dollar Tree at of all the job's i ever had was kind of worse all  I can say is my bosses made me feel comfortable I left because that's not the kind of job I want it
good,"The typical day would be what you expect in a retail environment. Management was fantastic, the hours were simple 8 hour shifts. I learned that good management can make work more enjoyable. The job was easy and environment was relaxing."
good,"dollar tree is very fun and family environment. I learned how to be a very well cashier, perfect for a beginner. the hardest things about this job would be very understanding with these customers."
good,The dollar tree experience is great because it has taught me so much  as a manger and I have developed in a customer service representative. We offer a large selection and I feel I know my way around the store. I was the up front assistant manager and now I am the freight manager learning alot
good,"Very relaxing but can get very busy"
good,I actually have a lot of fun working here. Not that many hours but things stay busy and never get too exhausting. Some weeks you can work more hours optionally but as a part-time associate we cannot receive overtime hours. I like this job and like the team.
good,"Dollar tree needs to be a little more proactive and flexible in a changing and very competitive business market. They bought Family Dollar and became very tight in spending money, not paying competitive wages to store personnel,which makes it hard to retain good employees"
good,It was nice to help people you knew as well as to meet new faces.  I particularly liked putting up stock as handling the register can at times be stressful.
good,"great working area!"
good,everybody in dollar tree was friends and the was close we had alot of jokes and we did alot of work we did thing together as a team for example i was stacking but if a cashier was out or running late  i would help out
good,Dollar tree was a great work environment. restock shelves over night. I learned how to utilize my time. management had a hard time keeping my name in there system.
good,"I worked part time at Dollar Tree for only a short three months but my co-workers were encouraging and upbeat, and it was a fun work environment. It was an all-round great work place."
good,"The working environment was good working as a team with other Associates, the only problem was our supervisor she never let the employees address or listen to the opinion even when something is wrong."
good,It s a great place to work at your team make you feel like your family and you look forward to go to work the next day and not even stress of not looking forward to work the next day they don’t judge you for who you are they are a great team to work with.
good,You definitely have to be tough for this job and they make that clear. The job is very easy to get as long as you can work the hours and hard to keep if you can't keep up. But if you can keep up they'll give you the hours and make it worth your while.
good,"With Dollar Tree as a second job, if the manager is willing they can be flexible with your hours. The hardest part of the job is the rush of customers but other than that the job is enjoyable. This job has provided me many things to learn about cash handling and customer service."
good,The Dollar Tree was a great place to work. It had a great working culture. Everyone there was on task and did what they needed to do and did it very well in a timely manor.
good,Great place to work with great people. Always learning something new. The team leaders are always there to help you and teach you new skills. coworkes are also great help.
good,"Very fast pace. Very friendly and room for advancement. 401 k which is a big plus. Management willing to work with associates. Dollar tree has product that is worth more than a dollar. You learn different aspect of associate, which means how to stock and merchandise."
good,TWO THUMBS UP! Very great place to work. Great hours.great people to work for and with... everyone does they're part...I believe the sales associate should get paid more than minimum wage...
good,"Good place to work for, very fast-paced. You have to be quick because the store can get really crowded. I learned how to attend customers better by working here. Coworkers were great people and the managers as well."
good,I had a good experience  with dollar tree.the Manger was excellent  it was also a very clean  environment.the management  helps if we needed help when it get busy.
good,"Work was tentative, I was always doing something. Talking with customers and working with management were easy and fun. Hardest part of the job was stocking shelves and maintaining structured products."
good,I was in charge of the store/ employees.. Making sure store was stocked and cleaned. I loved my customers and my customers loved me. Would help out with anything.. Had a checklist I had to finish before the end of my shift. Counted all monies and compared to the sales of the day.
good,"I enjoy working here, the only downsides are that I have to drive so far to go to work, as well as working nights also messes with my body. I do like the work environment just looking for something closer to home."
good,"A typical day at work is being on time for the shift clocking in, and getting right to work. Every day I learned more on how to cashier, stock and greet people."
good,Great place to work with flexible hours and nice managers and employees . Accommodated me while I was pregnant with lighter duties and a chair to sit and relax when needed
good,"Work was pretty simple for me I had to stock and prioritize items."
good,"Easy and enjoyable work, Great management and very friendly as well as very flexible with scheduling. Workplace culture was very relaxed as long as you did your job."
good,as a typical day at dollar tree as a manger i would come in say hello to all my coworker an they i would i go to the office and count the safe and then give my employees they job for they day
good,I like working at Dollar Tree. It is close to my home and when I need to be off work my supervisors are accommodating. I have a problem with the fact we do not get enough hours to survive off of.
good,I enjoy working at Dollar Tree. I love the customers. I like the people I work with... I really like stocking and setting up new things. I enjoy retail and would like to eventually become a manager.
good,Deals (Dollar Tree) is a GREAT work place I loved it. Personally if you are looking for a retail job I would go for Dollar Tree. They are really fun people to work with. It's easy to make friends and rarely get angry customers.
good,"It was a seasonal job & I enjoyed working here. The managers were amazing. I worked the Christmas season & it wasn't crazy at all, I'd go back if they asked."
good,Mornings start of slow at the Clearfield store. Then afternoon gets busy for rest of day...Mondays are our delivery days... And we always stock merchandise throughout the week.
good,I clocked in at 5:00AM and clocked out at 1-12 in the afternoon. I unfortunately had to leave without notice because I relocated to Sacramento. but over all while I worked there I put all my effort in and always got my job done.
good,cashier I also had to stock the lanes when we wasn't busy. I also had to help customers that needed the balloons feel I also did that as well. greet customers when they come in the store make sure the store was nice and clean.
good,always on my feet working all the time I do get days off but other then that great place to work employees friendly managers friendly keep the work place clean
good,"Typical day at work.... Run register, stock, help customers, take break, repeat then go home. Management is honest, fair and nice. Great customers too."
good,It's ok working here but I'm looking for better things I love my managers here they are by the book but the pay here does sucks but overall I like working here it's a friendly environment
good,I liked all the employees that worked there everyone  was willing to help eachother.The management was excellent they worked with you if you had to change the day you were suppose to work as long as one of the other employees could cover your shift they were ok with that. they just wanted to make sure everyone got the same amount of hours worked pure week.
good,"Management was always understanding of beyond your control life situations, Fun work place, energetic, friendly coworkers and management team. I loved being here."
good,"Dollar Tree is a great job to start with because it will teach one many skills as it has done so for me. Time manageagement is a great example because Dollar tree expects many tasks to be completed, and depending how well the four hours is managed will determine if those tasks will be done so the next casier is able to do what is expect within their shift."
good,"Busy time of year early fall to late winter, slow time of year early in the year to spring. volunteer to go home available at slow season but not required"
good,Es un trabajo entretenido tenía buen equipo de compañeros
good,Dollar tree is full of excellent workers and provides many options lot less than traditional supermarket to keep you stocked up for less on the essentials.
good,"Serving customers at check out "
good,"a typical work day was stocking shelves or standing at the cash register, helping customers. The job was VERY easy. the co workers were great to work with."
good,One of the Easiest and honest jobs to work and great fun and exciting to learn new skills and regular work hours show your good work and know your doing your job right was satisfying
good,"I liked being a cashier at Dollar Tree, it was clean, well organized, breaks, lunch, assistance if needed. Good management in my opinion willing to work with you."
good,I would still be at this job if it wasn't for a personal situation at home that changed my life forever..but none the less this was the perfect type of job for me.
good,"Feels different from the other doller tree i worked in, still a good work place just wish i get payed more for the hours is do. I work hard. Just to pay rent. But good attmisphear"
good,It for sure is a very productive fast day of people coming in and out of place always need to be able to multitask great chance to meeting and greeting people .
good,"I really enjoyed working there the job was pretty easy to do, but I mostly like when my reg customers would come in, I think having good people skills is very important, and working really hard at whatever task is given to you."
good,"I was only seasonal help to the store I was at, but I had never loved a job so much. The management at the time were all very, VERY nice and willing to lend a hand no matter the situation. Since there were so few workers at a time, it gave us time to get to know the managers and the coworkers. This personal work experience is very much so suggested for people for a first job, or just if you enjoy that environment. Even during the holidays, I only had one rude customer. Everyone was so nice."
good,The cashiers do their very best to make sure that the customer is happy while shopping as well as when they leave with their purchases. The cashiers also do a great job in keep the store clean and organized
good,A wonderful company to start at and work your way up the ladder to bigger and better things. It doesn't come easy but with hard work and steady dedication you can go places in this company.
good,"If you work hard you can go far at this company. Turnover is so high that if you work their for at least a year you are considered a huge asset to the team. Unfortunately for the first 6 months or so management wont really listen to you or try to work with you. It's a great job if you're in your late teens to early twenties because you get to meet tons of people your age, and being friendly with your teammates is really encouraged."
good,I enjoy working there we have a great team and we all work well together. I'm glad to have an opportunity to work there and learn about the Dollar Tree Brand.
good,"Working at Dollar Tree, I have learned teamwork. You can not run a retail store without a good team. The hardest part of the job is by far the physical labor. most people do not realize just how hard retail can be on you physically and mentally. Also the pay rate is not proper for everything you are tasked with doing in a day or even a week. My favorite parts of the job are the people, employees and customers. I could be having a horrible day, and someone, customer or employee, will do/say something to put into a better mood. If you can make me laugh my mood brightens a lot. Our customers are the sweetest and best people. We have a great team that sometimes feels more like a family. I would recommend this company to anyone that enjoys working with people and can handle the physical and mental effects of the job itself."
good,I loved working at Dollar Tree. The customers were so friendly and my  management staff worked with me by working around doctor appointments. I wish I could of stayed but I needed a higher paying job.
good,My time at Dollar Tree has been very enjoyable. I have been very thankful to have had the opportunity to start my working experience at the Dollar Tree. A typical day at work involves me assisting customers from the moment they walk in the door until they leave the store. I've learned outstanding customer service skills while working at the Dollar Tree.
good,Its was a great place to work the managers are nice and the coworkers are friendly. The customer are always so nice and they great you when they come in after you greet them
good,Working at Dollar Tree was calm and productive. Meeting new people that came into the store everyday was always enjoyable. My coworkers at the store and manager had very good personalities and were serious about their work and the store being neat and clean. By the end of my work day i wold go home with a lot of energy.
good,"it was a pleasant experience, what I enjoyed is that I allowed me to learn more about management skills and product handling, store set up and customer interaction."
good,Busy busy busy. Some management was always really serious never a smile alway ways too serious other than that. I enjoyed working with my othwr co workers and some management was awesome.
good,"enjoyed my time there, decent staff, good managers"
good,"This is an amazing place to work. The people are fun and the customers are great. During the time I worked there, there was a huge turn-over rate which was difficult ti work with, but other than that it was amazing."
good,Need security... Nice place to work if you like dealing with the public.. Didn't like the pay for cashiers. The highest they get is 7.36hr maybe 3 days per week 5hr shifts..
good,Overall I have lots of love for the Dollar Tree family and the opportunities that Dollar Tree has provided for me over the time period I've been going
good,I enjoy my job exciting something new everyday I love that you can move up only if you want and the opportunity is there thank you Dollar Tree your ASM just need to open window to more hours part time makes it hard for some.
good,Productive and fun workplace. Its a good job experience and friendly and welcoming to new associates. I love the experience that I'm getting from this job because I've been learning new things.
good,"I really enjoyed my time at Dollar Tree. I wish I could continue to work with them "
good,Great part-time job. Team work is a must here. Marketing skills are very important as well as good customer service. It's a great environment and I love the interaction with customers
good,"A typical day at work varies depending on the shift your working. For example going in at four in the morning demands to put out to sales floor as much merchandise as possible before store opens. Opening procedure include to count monies and allocate cashier to register. Closing is a bit more demanding it is a fast paced environment. Must be checking the watch in order to conduct all tasks needed before closing the store. My co-workers are great we all seem to get along and help each other when needed. All though not all stores are the same it all depends on the manager in charged. The hardest part of the job is receiving truck, it all depends on the amount of people unloading and the amount of merchandise received for the week. Usually there are 2 to 3 people working on truck. The most enjoyable part  of the job is to be the first one to see the new merchandise that arrives to the store."
good,Like any job Must show up for work. And there you have a job! Low pay good for new people in thevwork industry.  You will start to shop at the dollar tree if you havent yet. So addicting!!!!
good,"A Typical work day for  me would be a fast going , handling orders, picking up different tasks . Printing out documents and replacing orders. Making sure the all members of the team is on task and getting the job done. That would be  most difficult  part of the day.     The  most enjoyable part of the day would be dealing with the customers"
good,"I love working there, just started and feel very comfortable going on work. Everyone is,very nice. There are not feel any disrespect towards anyone. Thank you."
good,Dollar Tree store is a great place to work at especially if you love to be organized and neat. There is some opportunities to advance in this company which is great.
good,"I personally love working at dollar tree. It's a very friendly environment and the staff makes a great team for the company. Overall with management, customer service etc. it's a great place to work"
good,I enjoyed being there for the children and being able assist my supervisor in any way I was able to as a child care assistant.
good,The Dollar store was the first serious full time job that I started with. It is also a job where if given time you can advance. I received plenty of hours and had a lot of support. Within  three months of being a cashier I was offered a assistant manger position and I excelled at that. It was a very positive learning experience
good,"Good environment to work, meet new people everyday, the work is easy and simple, requires standing and moving. You learn about your customers personality along with your co-workers. management is excellent. the best part about the job is seeing kids tear up the toy isles."
good,I really enjoy working here. A very dependable staff and learn a lot of important managing skills.The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to meet and interact wth so many different types of costumers.
good,"I learned how to work  different cash register, clean up store as needed, help customers find items around store . Having little freedom to do what I want once all my other task are finished"
good,Learned about recovery and management. It was a great place to work if your looking for a part time job. I loved the environment and the manager. The longest job I stayed at.
good,I cashiered for dollar tree for a short time because it was only seasonal which was Christmas. The co-workers are very friendly and helpful. I cashiered and cleaned.
good,"Worked as cashier in a fast paced environment unless needed for stocking of merchandise. Built up a rapport with repeated customers and made welcome new customers. "
good,"Customer service, stocking the shelves with materials. Management was good. We all got along just fine. There was not really anything hard with this job. Christmas season, all of the beautiful decorations and smiling faces."
good,"Easy,  some hours. Simple. And easy to get the hang of.  But fun,  easy job for people who are starting their first job. Great management. But pay is low."
good,Great work environment. Nice calm environment to start the day off in and has many great benefits. Great lunch breaks and great staff.
good,Even though it was temp I enjoyed the dollar tree...10 min break only kinda sucked..but I really had fun working there close to home walking distance post a home walking distance cool associates awesome boss
good,I have been with Dollar Tree for a few years.   I love my job and the people i work with .   I have no problems with any of them.   The district manager is the problem.    For someone that use to be a Store manager knows what it is like pushing out frieght and running the store by yourself with only one person at the cash register but still continues to tell you that you need to pack out atleat 150 cases a day on your shift  or clean the whole store with one person at night .       It is very hard to clean a store within the 5 hrs that you are schedule for  and do go backs and be backup register .    The District manager needs to start respecting the management team of these stores and get her head out of her butt .
good,I stock. I learn that when you stock you know everything around the store. It is a good start. The hardest part is when their are kids that comes in store and purposely make a mess or break some of the objects. I enjoy organizing because I like to have an organize place.
good,"Performing the various jobs, gave me a good insight of what is expected in the real world."
good,"I had an awesome manager at the time of my employment. She was understanding to her employees needs at Doller Tree, 96 Boston Post Rd., Orange, CT 06477)."
good,Employer was a functional employer. By functional I mean they actually would fit themselves into what worked best for their associates around the daily operations of the company. It was a very structured place to work and very cheerful.
good,I was with Dollar Tree almost 9 years.  For the majority of the time I had great DM'S who was supportive and helpful. How ever there is always the apple who spoils the whole bunch.
good,Start off signing in and begin getting removing cardboard to the bin. I have to get a Till to start for cashier job. If I do not have a Till I go to My manager and or supervisor to ask what needs to be done. Stock shelf and well tidy for customers appeal. maintain every item will or will not go on to the public display. Keeping customers update information of dollar tree products so they can keep track of our orders. To fill out orders when shipment arrives. To make sure  the store close with the proper amount and to close the store without further adue.
good,"It's a warehouse, you can't expect much. It's a good work environment and is individually driven. Do your job- you won't have any issues."
good,My experience at Mile on Mile Trucking was a good one I loved working there it was almost like I was my own boss. But the people that I worked with were awesome and I loved it. If the company was to ever come to Amarillo I would go back.
good,"Achieved the needs and wants of customers needs"
good,"its a good job, benefits are good, when in peek season you get a lot of overtime as wanted,  not climate control, busy day, management cool"
good,Very organized and great looking Dollar Tree. Supportive staff and great co-workers. A lot of misplaced items to look for but that is expected. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my co-workers and the staff. Vacuuming was a little difficult due to having to reconnect the cord in different outlets.
good,Working at the Dollar Tree was the best job i ever had. The better you are at your job the more likely you are to move up and the quicker. My only problem came after i got injured at work. I wasnt compensated for the first two months that i was out. Also before i got hurt i started training for an assistant manager position but then i was out of work for a while and they gave away my position. But i can understand that they needed someone to do the job and i was no longer unavailable. Maybe i will be able to go back to work for them again one day.
good,"I would open the doors, I would count the money to make sure that it was right. Put money in the cashiers drawers. I enjoyed the co- workers. I would put stock up on the shelves."
good,always meeting and greeting a lot of different people but overall its a laid back job. co-worker are always assisting and there is always something to do.
good,"A typical day at work meant a lot of duties/tasks to be done doing your best work. Nothing but hard work was expected. I learned how to work with friendly and unfriendly customers. Learned how to handle tuff situations. I learned how to manage and work with my team members. Retail work was easy to understand the job at hand but required a lot of work and time. Hardest part of the job was dealing with unfriendly customers, but it was possible to handle with a friendly attitude. The most enjoyable part of the job was being active and having a privilege to work with and get to know other people within the workplace."
good,"Some days are busier then others. The staff are great to work with and easy to get along with."
good,"If you are looking to work for a place where they do not judge you this is the place to work. The will give you a chance even if you have a Master Degree and need to rebuild your working history.  I call this work environment a place that welcomes the person with the Master Degree and the GED.  They look only for positive worker, meaning it is not where you been but how you respect the work you do for their organization."
good,Awesome work place supportive it wasn't all about how much you make but how you personally took the good support and advice. this was the best job that I every worked at and work for it was so live and awesome and supportive.
good,"Show up in the morning take boss to bank to make the night before bank drops. Come back and start stocking shelves and coolers/freezers. Clean floors and bathrooms, round up carts and help when needed in the check stands. Most of the management was great and very likeable but there was one that wasn't so nice and  threatened to fire me if I didn't write out a paper to get someone fired and I couldn't take it anymore because I knew it wasn't right so I quit and went back to the cannery. Always enjoyed helping our guests an other employees"
good,First real job. Within the first year i was able to grow with the guidance from the store manager and other assistant store managers.

good,"important to stock everything in its correct spot and not to have anything that doesn't belong in the section just to make it easy for customers to shop. also, to have it as clean as possible to attract customers and avoid slips and falls. coworkers and satisfied customers made it easy and fun place to work. no hard part in the job and the best was to see a customer grateful for the experience in the store."
good,"Typical day at consists of moving fast, attending customers, and helping each other out. Learning from basic recovery to learning hoe to stock merchandise on truck days. Management always has an answer to which ever question is need to be answered, will try to work with your schedule. Hopes for the employee to learn quick and expects motivation to do the best job they can do. Hardest part of this job would be not having a set schedule, having to miss work due to change and not notifying workers of changes. Most enjoyable part, although, is the night crew who have a good work ethic and are willing to teach new workers how the job is done."
good,"early rise when it came to freight. fast paced stock in the mornings, and eager to close and and get home. easy to work with and fun to handle the challenging tasks."
good,"Was one of top cashiers and was relied on a lot. Did plenty of stocking, fixing the back room. Assisted customers all the time, which I loved. I was able to actually assist them more than I ever thought I could. I loved working here."

good,"A typical day includes various duties"
good,Had fun working with my co-workers we where like a family being part of management was a good experience makes me feel good about my-self and knowing that others liked working with me was also good hardest part was having different times to work almost everyday i want to have a set scheduled just getting to know people and making them smile was enough for me to have a good day at work.
good,People making you feel good when they recognize your good hard work you just completed. one manager makes you feel uncomfortable and want to quit.

good,A typical day at work was great. I learned alot from dollar tree and mangement treated me very well. I really enjoyed interacting with people and unloading the monday deliveries.
good,i stock and clean most of the day. i also run register and stock shelves. the management is very good and i love it! i sometimes do the truck.
good,The company is good if you are needing some extra money on hand. Management was great at working with school schedules and had no issues with this at all. However the oppurtunity to advance is near zero and the hours just are not there when you need them after you graduate.
good,"a typical day at the dollar tree greeting customers."
good,"Unfortunately you cannot get anymore then part time work there as a cashier. If possible, I would definitely work there on a full time basis. Our Manager and her Assistant Managers are fantastic!"

good,Wonderful company. Great management. I enjoyed the fast pace environment. I loved assisting the costumers as needed
good,"I enjoyed working with the employees and  store manager,  Got to know some of the customers by name. People love this store because you can find very good items for only $1. Good store to work for if this is your first CSR experience. You get to meets a lot of friendly people."
good,Going from fast food to retail is a relief on its own. Working in a store where everything is the same price makes things a lot easier for you to know how much everything is. My store manger was absolutely wonderful and I really got along with my District manager. It is a lovely company to work for.
good,"I really like this job , but it needs alittle improvment like camaras in there .The hardest part was unloading the truck and working your hardest but never was told that I did a great job."

The most enjoyable part of my job was the learning experience."
good,I have been working here for almost 4 months and have enjoyed every minuet of it. My co-workers are pleasant and management is great! I have decided that a full time position at another establishment will not stop me from working there on the weekends and holidays. The most enjoyable part of this job are the customers! Lots of laughs and great attitudes.
good,My day consisted of helping customers and providing customer service. I learned that people come from all walks of life but everyone should be treated equally no matter what the situation. My co-workers were really cool and we all got along. We all stuck together and helped each other out as a team. The hardest part of my job would have to be arranging items outside during the winter months. The enjoyable part of my job is knowing that me and my co-workers had each others back.
good,Everyone is always friendly. I like to stay busy and there was always something to do.
good,typical work day was fun.i learn to make sandwich management was great co-workers was great love to b at work there wasnt anything hard about the job i just enjoyed being there
good,Supervising employeers making sure they are doing their tasks that they are assigned to.
good,I enjoyed my co-workers. The hardest part of my job was stocking shelves. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping customers and employees.
good,"I started my day by clocking in. I then spoke with my manager to see what needed to be done, the usual thing I did first was the carts. I would take inventory down each isle. I'd help unload the trucks and haul product on a U-boat and stock the items. I did balloons for customers when needed for special occasions .I put the cardboard boxes in the broiler and worked that machine, I was cashier at times I was fairly new at it. I learned what work actually meant, I learned discipline because your in a place of work you can't do what you want. I learned how to interact with people with customers. I learned what my best was in order to get and sustain that job. I absolutely loved my management they had constructive criticism to teach me things I needed to be taught, they helped me as much as they could with no problems. The environment was just great to be around and everyone liked everyone and helped each other meet criteria. To me there wasn't really a hard part of the job but if i have to say it would be hauling those U-boats around small isles they kind of like to go in which anyway direction. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers out throughout the day, the people I met and after hours when we'd be closed and i'd be vacuuming the shop we all got together and would just talk about our day."
good,Easiest place to work and loads of fun. customers are polite and extra sales are easy to come by.
good,It was not bad at all.  The manager made sure you would have something to do even where there's a lot of downtime.  I learned that you have to treat both customers and coworkers with respect.  The hardest part of the job was trying to organize the warehouse of new merchandise that comes in every two weeks or so.  My coworkers are great people. They are very nice and they are willing to help you whenever you have a question.  The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the customers and making sure the customers come back to shop again by giving great service.
good,The staff members are great to work with. Managers are open minded and are willing to work with your schedule. I am often at the register but they have me stock whenever it is needed. Most of this job is easy.
good,A typical day at dollar tree was never the same. Management was great to work for. They worked with you and understood unexpected things happen when you have kids. The co-workers was great to work with. I learned that there are jobs out there that are really a team oriented environment. The best part about my job was that i got to meet new and exciting people every day. The worst part about my job was that it was second shift. Second shift is a hard shift to work with children still at home.
good,A typical day was when I arrived I had to clock in and pre-count my drawer to make sure that the amount was correct. After I did that I was to keep my register open and ring people out. When there was no line I was required to fill that time in with assisting other customers and stock the shelve. Every Saturday I was my responsibility along with the manager and the assistant manger to unload and organize the truck that we had every week. I was the only other cashier to help them do that because they trained me and I was told that I was the only one who knew how to do it the right way and in a very good timely manner compared to the other cashiers.
good,Well when i got there i would clock in and then set my cash register and then greet people as they came in and when they where ready to check out i would ring them up and ask them how are they and chat with them and also i would help them if they need to find something or answer any question they have. What i loved about my job was meeting new people and management was woundeful and my co-workers i loved. The hardest part of my job was stocking.
good,I really enjoyed working for dollar tree. I left because of my pregnancy ending early.
good,It was a good and fun experience to have. I would go in at 5 AM and leave at 8 AM. I learned stocking. The hardest part would be to remember where everything is. The easiest is to unload trucks
good,i think that its a place to work at. i learned a little bit. the co-workers afre fun.
good,"I've worked here just over a year now and I've had the opportunity to switch to three of the locations. This company has some of the greatest people I've ever had the privilege to work with. I enjoy going to work every day, I enjoy the people I work with and the interesting people I get to meet on a daily basis. No day is ever the same!"
good,"Stocking the floor, and get the back room in ready condition for truck day would be a typical day at work. I learned be a hard worker will help you get promoted. Management is very good. The store is exceeding expectations. The co-workers are great, we all help each other attain certain goals. The truck day is the hardest part of the job. Reason being, sometimes its just two people on a 2000 peace truck. The most enjoyable part of the job is stocking the front of the store, so everybody can see my work."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was organizing the store. The hardest part of the job was when I first started working I didn't know where anything was, it took me a couple of days to figure things out."

The co-workers there were cool to be around, especially the one's that were there before I was gave me alot of advive on what to do, and what not to do. The hardest part for me working at dollar tree was not being able to work alot of days because I was going through some personal things. The most enjoyable part was being able to a apart of that environment."
good,Productive and fun place to work and meet new people. I learned something new each and everyday if it wasn't from my co workers it was from customers. My favirite part of when you had customers that were regulars that came in not once a day but every once in awhile and you knew them by there name and they would greet you like they have known you for a long time

good,buen equipo de trabajo buen ambiente todo bien organizado
good,"I like working st my Dollar Tree.  My store manager tries to be fair to everyone.  She works as hard as the employees to keep the store clean and the shelves filled.

All she asks is for you to do your job and help out with any extra things when you are able."

Everyone has a great attitude and we joke around when not busy. The management is willing to work with you and your schedule. The hardest part of the job is when the truck does not show up. The most enjoyable part of the job is the co-workers and customers.
good,I enjoyed working there. It was a good fast paced job! The hardest part of the job was trying to get everything unstocked while there was customers in the store. The most enjoyable part of the job is I made some really good friends!
good,"I was sent to KY for training - 2 weeks with weekends off. Learning how to use pallot jack and fork lift - all 4 were not exactly what I'd be using at the Ohio center, but I learned them quickly and beat everyone, even with experience in 'timing'. My supervisor was not a good communicator and technically didn't have her certification to train us at the Ohio plant. We as a group hope she gets bumped. I was offered to be a supervisor - and my teammates thought it was a great idea, but there's not incentive - no pay increase. So, no I don't want the responsibility if I am not being paid more than any other. Raise to be anticipated in 90 days and again in a year. I work M-Th 7-5:30."
good,"Working at Dollar Tree is fairly simple, the only difficulty I could think of is the cleaning. A lot of kids run through the store and mess with stuff, even adults do the same. Other than that, its just you're average customer service job."

good,This was a part time job for a short period of time. I enjoyed working here as it was walking distance from my home.  All employees were very friendly and it was an enjoyable experience.
good,"The rules are not posted, made up as they go, I was unjustly fired for a mistake a co-worker started. I loved that job it was everything I dreamed, a good job, just poor rulings."
good,hard work for little pay and hardly no advancement. Very few hours unless you are full time then your full time hours are given to part time employees.
good,"Fantastic work environment managers would help for any question, work environment was always happy friendly and filled with hard working employees and excellent management"
good,Need better hours. And would love to become manager one day. And would love to have better pay for stockers. Could definatly use a night time stocker instead of just having cashiers at night. We could have more done at night too
good,"I liked working at Dollar Tree. "
good,I love my job at Dollar Tree. I love my managers who do their jobs well and I get along with all my coworkers. I enjoy helping people and I'm going to miss my regular customers when I find a new job.I'm not getting enough hours and I need to find a job with a little more pay because I'm a single mother of an 8 month old daughter and things are very hard for me right now supporting her by myself.
good,"It’s ok for a start off job, but not a good place to make a living  or you can get you a second job alone with dollar tree like me I work two other jobs alone with dollar tree"
good,"The most enjoyable part of working at The Dollar Tree was that you can get help with whatever you needed. You can interact with the customers and help them out,show them new products on the shelf. Great work place ."
good,Dollar tree is a fun place to work for with an awesome management who are always there to help you out with whatever you need help with . . They're also patient with training an new employee .
good,I really loved working at both dollar trees in Laurens and Clinton. I love ppl bc i am a ppl person. I love being seen. I'd love to get bk in dollar tree.
good,After we started fire certain people we got robbed 4 times in 1 month which was very scary for me as a mom.to think that I may not had made it home to my child one day.
good,It was fast paced good pay. Kids come in everyday to say hi to workers. Very community friendly. Nice place to work although it would get very messy throughout the day & people ate things while walking through the store.
good,Dollar Tree is a great place to work and great benefits but does not have room for growth. I only left because my family was growing and i need more income.
good,Working at the Dollar Tree was enjoyable. Providing a positive shopping experience is always fun. There are always good products at low prices. Everything is one dollar.
good,I learned how to use the cash register and was nervous about that but was easier than expected. Management is very nice and welcoming. Most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with customers.
good,Every employee made it their goal to meet custom satisfaction. We all had a good time working because we were a team that got a long. It was one of my favorite jobs.
good,Dollar Tree Was Definitely Good And A Great Learning Experience. Working  There Taught Me To Be Mature And Gave Me A Glimpse Of What The Real World Is Like
good,The job was fine other them the general manager was very unprofessional and they use their workers and treat their team members very disrespectful. The floor manager for my shifts seemed to know and work more then the general manager. They placed me on the cash register witch i had experience with just not that exact type. Some can be very different and this one was. They walked outside with then the first 10 mins of my first day. Nobody was around to help or even ask for help. They showed me how to do nothing. Or even asked of i knew how to complete my job or help my customers.
good,I Love working at Dollar Tree is I move back to Jersey that will be my first place i go back to. It also a job that u can learn alot from the managers they willing to help you with everything
good,I loved working there the manager was relaxed but the district manager was hateful. Unloading the truck by hand was okay but on cold days. Stocking was easy just create a flow
good,Someday's were slow. It can be a seasonal or a job you go to everyday. The management team was great. You have to know your limits to lifting things and restocking. Also can just be a closer which can be VERY hard and long. Know the area of the store very well. Also must be very good at multitasking.
good,"If I can sum up how my time was at ""The Dollar Tree"", it would be that I felt more secure at the store. I felt the need to be more clean with my life and leave all of the ugly in the past behind. I didn't receive benefits at the job I did not ever leave work for a leisure moment I continued my days to work there and removed myself from here because I did argue with my manager he told me a command and I then refused his commands so I left and quit the job. I am so pleased he doesn't work there anymore."
good,dollar tree is a cool place to work if you happen to live close too one the manager you have could either be really cool or a pain in the behind my manager was super cool wish i had more like him
good,"I worked here briefly, but nevertheless I loved the time I had here. my only complaint was the employees try to dominate the managers like they're the ones that ran store. Just be careful and politely assert your dominance. But I would love the opportunity to return to the company."
good,"All you had to do was be nice to customers, work cashier, Fill up balloons and do go backs. You had a 30 min break each shift and it was relaxing, the people were nice and so was management."
good,I loved working there. Environment was very comfortable. I loved everyone that  i worked with my casheirrs and my store manager. Wish i could go back!
good,"I love working there, plus I shop there and I love shopping at Dollar Tree. I learned how to deal with customer the right way. And to cherish the people you work with."
good,"Dollar Tree is a very good place to work,you get to meet new people and you always have a chance to advance. I worked there for 2 years as assistant manager and I loved it. The only reason I left that job was because I relocate out of state."

good,Everyone's friendly and helpful when you need it there's always someone on the floor to help you find things. if you cant find something they'll go into the back and look for you.
good,"What can I say. I've had good days and bad days here. But rather good or bad, I love my job and don't want to lose it. My general manager told me that he is going to put me in for an ASM position because of my hard work."
good,It was a great experience with friendly coworkers. I was trained well by management. The customers were very understandable and we all worked together at all times.
good,Dollar Tree is a very Nice Store it is very busy everyday but mostly on Holidays. I learned how to be multitask ; My manager is very Nice & helpful. The prices of each item are great and affordable and the most fun part about my job is helping others.
good,"I enjoyed my time with the company. The employees and most customers wore a smile and had fun personalities. The work was fast-paced and slow at times. The pace can change on a dime and can wear you out, but being proficient is part if the job."
good,"I enjoy being part of the team. They paid good , also they treat me with respect and equality.Management was nice and explain situation patiently.They give lots of over time"

good,"As a store manager, your store is a direct reflection of how you manage your people and processes.  If you work 50 hours a week and train your staff properly it will be rewarding in the future."
good,Ive been her for a year and received a promotion within a few moths along with raise and better benefits. Gave me the managerial expri was looking for.
good,The managers where i worked were amazing. The customers were very friendly and always willing to make conversation with you. The hardest part was being on your feet for so long.
good,"Dollar Tree is the wonderful company to work for. Value their employees and customers, and believe in high level of customer service. I would recommend this job to anyone. I enjoy what I do."
good,As an assistant manager you help with the daily operations of the store. Assign duties to cashier and stockers to ensure that the all tasks are done for the day. Train any new employees coming in. Act as a back up cashier when store becomes busy. Help with any customer complaints or concerns. Balance cashier tills at the end of shift and create back deposit at the end of day to take to bank.

good,I loved my job at Dollar Tree. Management was really good and very respectful. I worked during the holidays so everyday was \packed and hectic. I would totally recommend this job.
good,The work was easy to do being a cashier as well as stocking the sales floor.  Easy to know where things are assisting clients and what products the store sold.  Can get busy during holidays or major events like graduations.  My manager when I was employed there was awesome and super understanding when I wasn't able to make it into work.  Workplace culture is relaxed.  There wasn't anything hard about the job duties given.  Loved working with my coworkers.
good,Dollar tree was an awesome experience for me. I was introduced to a culture predicated on unity and advancement. I learned much from this company about customer relations and service.
good,It's kinda demanding have to stock and Cashier by yourself. Though I did enjoy myself working there just sometimes wish I had help at times when the line gets long
good,"The managers are nice everyone is sweet I have nothing bad to say about working here other then the pay.. you get experience working the register, get 15 min breaks, I would still be there if I live closer it even working for the minamum wage to be worth it"

good,Working at dollar tree is fun and your always busy. The good thing about management is that they are so willing to help in whatever you need help in .

good,There was a time and place at the job in the dollar tree in which I needed to unload the truck but there was only about three of us. So we continue to unload am not going to say it was easy but I truly cooperate with everything I needed to do in the job surface. It was about 4 in the morning to later on in the afternoon. The best part of the job was we had the chance to listen to music and work at the same time. I definitely like to rearrange things and organize the shelves when I get a chance make things neat as it supposed to be. Make space for the new things that are coming inside the store. It would be put into place and manage things correctly  therefore my job was done according to my manager.
good,"Working at dollar trew is a lot of fun manily because of my manager's, co workers and customera that come in daily. Some days you would be on the register and some days your on the floor stocking and moving things around"
good,working at dollar tree was a great experience the manergers was great at they job when an employee needed something done they staff made sure it was handled the right way
good,"A typical day at work involved opening the store and making sure all product from the store room would make it to the floor and to greet each and every customer with a smile and thank you for coming in. Always made sure that my employees would know their job task for the day and also made sure that they would meet their quota. And also on other days I would make sure that when I closed, I would have to take deposits to the bank nightly. Make sure all money was counted and all paper work would be finished and submitted. The hardest part of the job was when it came time to have to fire someone. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know new people and being able to make sure that we had a fun and loving environment."

good,"I absolutely loved working at the location in Moscow, ID. The staff was great and the customers were great. I enjoyed working at the Idaho Falls location as well, I just wish it would have lasted longer. At the very least I wish they would have told me that I was being let go rather than just not giving me hours and assuming I would get the hint that I was no longer employed with them."
good,"I really enjoy working here ... I would love more hours ... in my personal opinion there should be at least a couple more employees on each shift to get more product out to the shelves for the customers to purchase,, and help keep the store clean and tidied up ..."
good,very fun fair place to work for and the store manager was awesome.. everyone was treated with respect and it was a good way to make extra holiday money.
good,I had to quit do to medical but the Dollar tree in junction city kansas is a very wonderful place to work they treat you like family there. I miss working there i love everyone there and the customers are awsome yes you get some cranky rude and just down right awful but most of the are great.
good,I like dollar tree very cool place to work gets busy during holidays in some weekends but overall its fun the paid could be better also the co workers could be a little more friendly.
good,"Love the customers and the customer service aspect of the company.  Had limited payroll so time management was essential. Hardest part was stocking the shelves while maintaining payroll requirements. Had a great time setting up new stores, however I was never offered a permanent position as a set up coordinator."
good,It was a seasonal job that turned into full time. Great place to work. Very friendly environment but always busy. You stay on your toes with this job. Advancement is always earned but they do give it with honorable work ethic.

good,The majority of management where all deeply devoted parents and were always willing help each other. They fostered a very loving and supportive environment.
good,I enjoyed working at the store because it was fast-paced and everything was $1.00. Everything was smooth:  Sign-in on the P.O.S. and start your job.  One thing that I noticed was that of all the retail stores I have worked it was required that you get your breaks and lunch although your Manager or Leader would have to relieve you.
good,"A typical day at work at Dollar Tree affords you and opportunity to meet wonderful customers looking to take advantage of the great buys located within the walls of Dollar Tree. During my tenure with Dollar Tree, I am amazed at the number of fantastic items that are available to purchase for a Dollar. Everyone in the stores I have worked are positive and upbeat people. The hardest part of the job is the long hours that is occasionally required of the Store Manager. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new and interesting people everyday."

good,This is a great place to work. They have great management and it is a great company to work for. They care about their employees and there is always room for advancement.
good,A normal day at work would be me working the register mostly. I learned how to effectively use a cash register. The manager was fair and kind. The workplace was very easy going. The hardest part of the job was learning to how to use the cash register. The most enjoyable part of the job was teaching new recruits how to perform tasks.

good,On a daily it is busy with hundreds of customers but my co-workers are awesome and team work is a must including our management. Sometimes it gets so busy it gets hard to keep your line going. Best part is when customers leave happy and satisfied.
good,"I helped customers and answered anything they asked also show them the item that they were looking for to purchase. I did cashiering, Office cash outs, Stocking, Organizing, Unloading Truck, Etc."

good,"Never a dull moment...enjoyed all co-workers and manager, we laughed and had fun but we worked hard. Being on my feet constantly was the hardest part of the job.  Enjoyed working with the public and sharing all the new products received in store. Especially enjoyed working with money - cashiering and daily deposits. Restocking what people left behind was a difficult task to keep up with."
good,"With mindful management and great coworkers, the work day may get busy but there is never a dull day. Daily tasks may vary: cashiering, shelving items, cleaning, and seeing to customer needs. The hardest part of the job is also the most enjoyable part: attending to clients while getting routine tasks completed in a timely and efficient manner. Overall, it is a great and fulfilling work experience."
good,Great people clean on task .welcoming .plenty off opportunities  .great staff flexible team work .multitasking .greats with keep a outstanding growning foundation
good,They should have the early shift employees could come in and stock merchandise before opening the store for customers too be able to find the items instead of stocking during open hours and having to wait almost at the end of the day or half of the store hours to be able to find what the customer is looking for on the shelves
good,"I've only worked for Dollar Tree for 2 months now and I absolutely love my job,it's a fun atmosphere the other staff are always willing to help if needed and the management is wonderful,there is always room for advancement if you choose to.I wish the offered more cashiers full time that's the neg.thing I have about this company."

good,I was a cashier at Dollar Tree and scanned customers items as well as bagged them. It was an easy job but due to school i had to resign my position. I learned how to have great customer service skills. Always greet the customers with a smile. Management was very nice and treated you with respect. My co-workers were graet and very helpful. Nothiung was really hard at Dollar Tree except dealing with customers who are in a hurry and start to complain if your going to slow for them. I enjoyed my co-workers they were very nice
good,"I would open and close the stores that I managed, I had 3 stores . I would make deposit and count tills , I also order for the stores and cashier from time to time ."
good,"Dollar Tree is a great place to work, I loved the store, the clientele the team, Didn't like the drive as they don't place you near. Regional team isn't great. If you want to better your career. Choose another company."
good,I just started so I don't have a lot to say. But so far so good.  I'm looking forward to my future with them. 3 breaks in 1 shift is unheard of. My last job said breaks were  courtesies not guaranteed.  So thank you.
good,I did have a lot of fun here and learn a lot from my management team they all are willing to help and show you the tools to grow as a person was great
good,the tasks were day to day but the freight was the same. customers always asking questions and trying to get all the stocking done at once. The Store manager was very negative towards the customers and other employees.
good,"This job I loved the most cause I loved all my coworkers and the management was amazing. I loved going to work everyday and knowing my day was going to go good. I never had a bad day. The hardest part of my job was when I unloaded the truck and i didnt know where the boxes went, other than that this job was great!"
good,"My favorite part of my job with Dollar Tree in Erie, PA. was greeting our customers while processing their puchases. I was always upbeat with a smile on my face mainly because our management was encouraging, supportive and efficient. Working with my co-workers was not a difficult task. Our management really had a skill in choosing employees that were pleasant, hard working and dependable. I learned that with a good team, the work place does not feel like a job, it feels like something I thoroughly enjoy doing."
good,"A typical day at work starts by greeting customers walking out and other co workers.Clock in and get the day rolling. This is my first  customer service job,so i was a little scared in the beginning but now im well confident in myself and i get the job done fast and neat . I love my management they are the best bosses i've ever had, strict but every nice !! hardest part is telling people everything is one dollar lol because they just dont seem to get it. love it rate 10x"

good,Fun exciting day at work just keeping customers happy learned to deal with some customers attitude and to treat people better than they treat me
good,"My typical work day is sometimes slow and sometimes busy. I learned you got to be able to be patient with the customers no matter what. The managers there are great, if they see you doing something your not supposed to be doing they will pull you to the side and talk to you about it instead of embrassing you in front of your co-workers and if you need somebody to talk to they are always there to listen. My co-workers are great they are always they when you need help with something and or if you don't understand anything. The hardest part is when one of the customers has so many questions, question that you don't have the answer to and they keep asking anyway no matter how many times you have told them you don't have the answer to it. The  most enjoyable part of my job is some of the customers will just confide in you, talk to you about anything, they will tell me how they're day is and or was going"

I was the only full time manager and I was in charge of truck and stocking shelves. I enjoyed all of my cashiers and my stocking crew.

good,Nice place to work when you need flexible hours and little hours. The general manager is very friendly and nice. she helps with your hours when you need it.

The workplace is a friendly and welcoming environment, along with my coworkers. The work is easy, the customers are generally pretty friendly and everything seems pretty smooth each shift."
good,"This job was relatively easy, you have your typical duties as cashier: stocking/restocking, making sure the stores clean and taking care of customers and handling transactions.

My location is one of the busiest locations, As a manager we cash out all registers, deposit large amount of money, at the end of the day. we ensure all merchandise is restock for the next day. we also have to make sure that our work place is a safe environment for our customers."
good,"I have been working at Dollar as a clerk for nearly 3 years. Since I do enjoy the public and meeting people this has been a very good and challenging experience for me.  A normal shift is usually 4 to 4-1/2 hours and you are constantly busy helping customers.  I also fill impluse (items at the checkout) and keep a clean and organized register area. The staff is great and we are all team players. It is also a multi-task postion, i.e. answer phones, direct customers to the appropriate aisles, and handle returns and exchanges."
good,"A typical day at work is unloading the truck and getting everything put into place. What I have learned from working there is how to work well with others and how to categorize things. The co-workers are very friendly and they try to make the best out of their day at work by having fun and staying on task at the same time. The most enjoyable part is that the job is very simple and how everybody at the job is genuinely very nice and respectful towards one another. Overall, the management and everything at the is good. It is a great part time job and I have no complaints about it except for not getting enough hours during the week ."

Plus I also worked there til I went to work at Mailing Services of Pittsburgh."
good,"A typical day would consist of scheduling, checking, cash handling/balancing, cleaning, stocking of freight, greeting customers and providing them with outstanding customer service, deposits, overrides, voids, creating end caps, hanging/managing clip strips and more. I learned a ton about how retail companies operate, why they place certain items in certain locations, how to create end caps that sale and promote sales of various products at a time, I learned how to manage and schedule our team and how to encourage and promote additional sales at the register which we called ""drive items"". I started out as a cashier and worked my way up to management. All of my co-workers were fun, hardworking individuals. The hardest part of my job would be when I'd need to take disciplinary action with one of my workers for tills being off, breaks not being taken or taken for too long, or when they would no call no show. The most enjoyable part of my job was leading a team that shared a common goal while getting to utilize my business degree."
good,Typical day at work for me is making customers smile. I've learned that every part of the store you need a lot of patience. The management and my coworkers are really hard workers and very reliable. They have this open relationship treating each other as family. The hardest part is when there's no customer the most enjoyable part for me is working with them and not worrying about time.
good,A typical day at work for me was always helping others makeing sure task were done and more. Ive learned that customers really do appreciate treating them with respect and makeing sure all their needs are fufilled and theyll always come back.

The most enjoyable part of my job was all the people co-workers and customers i love seeing people happy.

good,"I was a assistant manager so life for me was all about non existent. I was very dedicated to this job and sacrificed everything to have it.I opened and closed the store, handled money from the safe to the cashier. I was in charge of making sure my cashiers were happy and that things were organized the right way for Dollar Tree standards. As well as, making sure that every customer was greeted and made to feel like a second home if you will. I worked very long and sometimes stressful shifts. Although I disagree with the way we dealt with customers that shoplifted it could at times be dangerous. This is were I lost interest in my job at Dollar Tree. I made descent money and enjoyed my job there a lot."

Or may i say didnt mind at all going to work, because in order to be happy you have to love your job. And people whether Strangers or Friends that you see everyday as for me become Family."

good,Dollar Tree and Tops are very good employers.  I would just like full time so I would be able to have only one job.  I get along with all my co-workers.  I am very busy and I like that.  The hardest parts of the jobs is when I have to work open to close at both places.  12 hr days are long.  Meeting all the different people is the best part

good,"I was a store manager in Ohio and I LOVED Dollar Tree as a company. Every job has it's ups and downs but fortunately for me, I had a strong DM to support me. The main issue with DT is that many times, the goals are unrealistic. I understand the idea of the company and to always stay busy. To maximize work and minimize walking which is ideal but many times, it's not realistic. It was something I had to get on board with because I supported the goals of the company but I also had to delegate to my team what I felt was the most productive and beneficial for my store because management won't always be in your store. I will be. And I needed a team that was happy and felt good about what they did because the pay is not the best and it's very easy to lose quality candidates to competitors for even a dollar more an hour. Money talks. With DT, money talks to the managers through bonuses but not to the cashier's or freight teams. I wish DT would allow for increases in pay through a quartly or annual review of employees. "
good,"While i was at the dollar tree, the only thing i had to worry about was the contant flow of overwhelming costumors, but that is going to happen anywhere you go. I feel as if it was a good experiance for me because now i can handle myself better around people, and i can aslo do very well under pressure."

I learned how to plan, stock sufficiently, work with speed and think before acting. My manager was great, I had an awesome connection with her.

good,"good place to work, all co-workers and management very friendly"
good,"At Dollar Tree a typical day at work would be clocking in on time with my work uniform on and ready to work. Before providing service to customers and opening the store I have to count the safe and also count my drawer. Checking the computers to make sure that everyone has clocked in the previous day, reviewing emails, walking around the store to see if everything is ready and in its place, and making sure the bathroom is clean is apart my daily routine. I have learned at Dollar Tree that customer satisfaction is the key concept of making it a successful business. I also learned that becoming an assistant manager is a great challenge to overcome. The duties are different and you have to have a lot of responsibility and I developed more knowledge. My co-workers and I got along very well due to the respect we had towards each other and the positive atmosphere we created. Hardest part of the job is dealing with difficult customers which I learned how to handle very well. When dealing with a difficult customer all you have to do is make sure that they are happy at the end and keeping a positive attitude. The most enjoyable part of the job is everything since I love to be active and keeping myself busy throughout the whole day."

good,My typical day at work consists of getting all employees set up with the proper tools and duty details to ensure proper productivity throughout the day. Stock merchandise while taking care of the needs of cashiers and customers. The main thing that I have learned as being apart of the management team is to LEAD BY EXAMPLE. This company believes that management is to delegate jobs only and I don't believe that is how you treat employees that you want to work hard for you. The most enjoyable part of my job is my co-workers and how well we all work together. Our team is soo productive because we all do our own job as well as help each other. 
good,"When I start my shift it is sometimes busy. I am either a cashier or doing recovery and cleaning the store. I learned how to deal with customers, that I work fast, and I do well after I am very comfortable with my job. Management is good, they address any problems I tell them about. My co-workers are all very friendly and helpful. The hardest part of the job is that I am always the one closing. I wish I had more set hours and they were earlier in the day and had weekends off. The most enjoyable part of the job is that the customers and my co-workers are very nice. It is a great first job."

good,"intermitted in mircrosoft word95,2010, windows 95,97,7, internet, and email"
good,Dollar Tree I can honestly say is one of the easiest jobs you could ever work at. A lot of work at these stores is nothing compared to most other jobs. You interact with customers every day and it's usually an enjoyable time. Working here I've increased my experience with handling customers and working with others. The hardest part of this job is that there aren't very many hours available at most locations so there isn't much pay involved.

good,"My day starts off with, stocking/rotating Food, Drinks, Snacks, Housewares, and any other departments if needed, while helping customers during the course of my shift. After, I go into warehouse, and take out garbage, cardboard bales, and straighten up the merchandise on pallets. Tuesdays are truck delivery day, and we unload up to 1,700 boxes. I've learned how to utilize, and condense space for more product. How to tie in products with others for a better way of advertising certain merchandise. How the whole Corporate structure operates at Dollar Tree. Etc.. The management at Dollar Tree is very helpful, a pleasure to work with, and very appreciative/complimentive on the work I do. My co-workers are the exact same way as the managers. The hardest part of my day is getting the cardboard bales out the back door. The warehouse we have is very small for all the merchandise we have so I usually have to tip the bale over on it's side (lifting it by hand) just to get it through the walkway, and out the door. The bales range anywhere from 200-500 lbs. but I manage to get it done in quick enough time. The most enjoyable part is working there all together. Everyone gets along great, open minded, and are pretty professional."

good,"typical day at work was get there clock in, go get stock and start organizing. when a customer came i would go to the cash register. i learned that when ur in that line of work its not all about u, its about the people around u like your coworkers and also the customers and trying to get them to come back. the hardest part was for me with both jobs. that when people rely on u they come to u and dont get ur project done or u do but its at the last minute. my most enjoyable times was to the night crew we had fun messing with each other and laughing and having fun."

good,"I would assist customers if they have questions. I would either check them out or assist to find what they came into the store for, or if we do not have them, I would advise them that we are either out of stock or we do not carry that item. If we carry that item and are out of stock, I would advise them to come a day or two after the truck of merchandise comes to see if it was brought into the store. If there is a delivery truck that would be scheduled to be there, one would help them unload. Some things may be stocked that day as well."

good,"You have to be physically ready to work in a warehouse setting. Production is everything so you may be pushed to your limit if you do not realize what your signing up for. It is not too difficult once you settle in. The hardest part of the job may be adapting to the physical labor if you not used to that sort of thing.The most enjoyable part is seeing how things work, because stores would not exist if it were not for this line of work."
good,"The job was great but more hours are needed to be given, the shifts are very short and some employees only get up to 15-20 a week. Personally that’s not enough hours for one to make a living"
good,i learned at dollar tree you haft to work as a team at a fast pace and you can get the company taking to court if a customer was to slip an fall from a box that was on the floor from you stocking i also no that frozen foods must be stocked first also if you see a coworker stealing an report it you can get up to 1k on your check and to never let anyone in the back where the boxes and we have no restroom for customers.

I learned how to manage teams, handling large sums of money and the importance of carrying a stores name. The workplace culture is very diverse.

good,"I have been with the company for almost 2 years now. I have been with approximately 4 stores. The number of stores due to shortage of management in those few stores as well as trying to advance in my own career. It's not a job to stay with for so many years with me only being in my late 20's but I'm making the best out of my career as I can. I have grown to admire a few workers and even see then as my family, but skmetimes, depending on the store and management you are sent to, it can be a family style store or a ""fend for yourself"" kind of store."
good,Its just good to be around new people and get to know new people. But be careful with the bosses they tend to do tick for tat with their workers.
good,Awesome work environment and they respect you as a human being.Also good hours and loved who I worked with. Positive attitude was key and I loved it all my managers were supportive in everything family orientated
good,It was very difficult to maintain employees that didn't want to work. We had to unload the truck and we had to keep the store clean for inspection. I had to assist by giving good customer service
good,"working at dollar tree was great because of the fact the manager was awesome, the pay was great, and also everyone was friendly, working at dollar tree i got taught things i didnt know about like how to do pay roll and also the co workers were very helpful, the hardest part of the job was losing the job by relocating for school"

We would be ready to unload the truck and get things going to start putting things up on the shelves once the truck was unloaded. We had a conveyer belt that we used and it was fun watching the boxes come down it and sometime get stuck. We all had our specific rollers that we were working on and we loaded them up with our specific items that came our way. If it was not mine I would send it on down the line, if it was I would grab it and put it on my roller."
good,A day at work is enjoying helping customers and maintaining a safe and clean work environment while also instructing my employees what to do.
good,"A typical day at Dollar Tree was professional and these were my duties,cashier,stocking merchandise and zoning department,freezer,keep area of work suitable for customer view assist all customers In aprofessional manner and always thanked customer and proceeded to take each customer to aisle where product was at and worked well with each shift manager."

good,"you unload the truck or load shelves make sure isles are clean and so is the store"
good,"I was responsible for replenishing stock, putting away inbound freight, and fulfilling shortages for outbound freight.  I also performed all other duties asked of me pertaining to warehouse operations wherever I was needed on a daily basis, which made the job more interesting and less redundant, and helped me be a more versatile asset to the company by learning all phases of warehouse operations.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the management team was basically a hands-off team, and I enjoyed being able to tackle tasks on my own.  I always felt like any problem I had they were there to offer input.  One of the most challenging things I was faced with was being appointed to be part of the Safety Committee.  My desire and the importance of the responsibility for this made me not a popular person among my co-workers."
good,"i was the cashier and stocker, it was a fun and fast paced enviorement.the managment was good and so were my co workers.hardest part of the job was getting paid so little to do so much."

good,"Dollar Tree has everything planned out, and easy to follow guidelines. The management system is perfect, and everything just had a solid flow to it."

The stock crew consists of 4 to 5 other stockers that help unload a truck once a week consisting of anywhere from 1100 to 1600 pieces of freight that have to be stocked on shelves and planned for new placement for the new product. The hardest part of the job is the inconsistency of hours that we receive to fulfill this goal.
good,"Average day at work involved assembling goods, operating the cash register, filling balloons, answering phones, making announcements and doing recovery. Occasionally I would help out the freight manager with stocking when necessary. Management was a little slow to get me on-boarded but otherwise friendly and fast to train me. My job at Dollar Tree was very enjoyable and had minimal stress."

good,"Greeting customers"
good,"I would go in a half hour before the store opened , do a store walk to reassure myself that the store was ready for the day, and note the items that needed to be addressed. Go to the office balance deposits and the safe . set up and assign cash drawers and put them in the registers. At this time I would check e-mails . tasked needed to be assigned and any problems addressed.  the day once the store was opened consisted of taking care of e-mail requests ,ordering merchandise, setting displays and endcaps .Merchandising. I would also do interviews, hire people. discuss store needs and issues with my assistants. Asset protection was always important. Daily planners were set. In the evening the store was cleaned and all returns put away . Damages recorded, deposits made and store closing And the most important of all customer service."

good,"Solve customer concerns, complaints, and question about product. Keep up with daily sales to achieve daily quotes. Keep all customers happy to guarantee they will return."
good,The hardest part of this job was recovery.  You have to go around daily and pick up the items that customers put down.  As easy as this sounds we were always changing where things go so yo uspend most of your night trying to find out where they go.  The co-workers were always fun and the short shifts for the cashiers was great.
good,Overall great job with excellent management and flexible hours.
good,Liked the work.  Got good training from the manager.  Variety of work made it different each day.
good,"Management and co workers were great to work with. If I would definitely recommend this job to others,"
good,Dollar tree was a very relaxed and friendly place of employment. though we only received 10 minute breaks sometimes it was needed. The hardest part of the job as trying to complete all assigned tasked within your scheduled shift. management was very flexible if you able to verbalize your issues properly. yet the atmosphere created by management and other employees was wonderful and honestly gives you a reason to want to come to work.
good,"Best environment friendly  co-wokers good experiences.Good pay. Fun while working hard at times, unloading truck, or stocking the shelves."

good,Great manager some supervisors are immature Not big enough store shelves become very dense and overly filled quickly
good,"Great place to work during my employment with them.  Every employee was driven, motivated, friendly and eager to lend a hand when needed.  Management was stern but fair, and led by example.  One of the best teams I've had the pleasure of working with, by far.  Hardest part of the job would have to be offloading 1,200 piece trucks, case-by-case, in -20 weather.  A place of employment I looked forward to going to every day."
good,Most days are great and I've learned many things working in retail. My co-workers and managers are awesome. The hardest part was learning where everything went at first on my few days of working. I enjoy working with everyone and helping customers meet their needs.

Management was great. They were fun to work for and with. They demanded your best were respectful, kind, honest, helpful,  understanding, and displayed great leadership. My co-workers were kind, respectful, fun to work with and overall good people. The hardest part of the job for me would have to be trying to clean up the store, assist customers, and complete my paper work for the day; while closing the store after a very busy day. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my managers and co-workers."
good,"Working at Dollar Tree was very fast paced and quick, which is exactly why i enjoyed it so much, i love being taught new things and being put on my feet to complete the task which i have learned right away once i got it under my belt.

Every week we had different types of new merchandise coming in so we as a team we responsible for promoting any new products coming in and provided feedback to the District Manager and Regional VP.I learned early on that if we worked as a team and had constant communication with the District Manager that we had a great opportunity to provide valuable feedback. My co-workers were one of the best crews i've had and i liked the fact that they were always willing to try new things to become more efficent and profitable.

good,"Large cast of personalities to interact with and many very enthusiastic managers makes for a satisfying work combination, many of the staff are friendly and open to conversation. the best part about working was you never really did the same thing most of your shift there, many things to be done to break up the monotony every once in a while. I guess the hardest part of the job is the customers that come in every once in a while who are not as friendly or enthusiastic to meet you. typical day at work starts with you either being on the register or being in charge of recovery of the store which could sometimes take up your whole day, when you are free you're often expected to clean up around the store or put back misplaced merchandise, other than that the job is very fun, highly recommend."

Wait until the trucks unload all of the inventory and we take them to the isles and stock until the store opens and until the store closes. The managers were very friendly and work orientated. The hardest part of the job would be trying to stock a certain amount of U-boats within the time given. What I enjoyed the most would be my 8 hour days working from opening to closing.

The first thing I learned was that the customer is always right and to do my best to be as helpful as possible. The management team was great they were always available whenever necessary .

Working with different cultures gave me a chance to understand  others and their life styles.  the only thing was getting use to different management every three months and adjusting to their way of managing. The most fun part was getting to know and work with other cultures. Learning new experiences, and having the opportunity to work."

good,This company attracts a customer base from all walks of life. It was an interesting experience every single day that I worked there. Even those wanting to come to work there were enthralling.
good,As a manager at Dollar Tree you always had to make sure things looked really nice your customers are happy in your plays were happy also. Some days it wasn't as easy as it seems some days it was really hard to do but when your employees have a good head on their shoulder and are positive it helps you realize that happiness is all that matters

The hardest part of the job is knowing when you're short of staff you have to work extra harder to finish your task.."

good,"My typical day at work here was the funnest and the most hard I worked ever in my life. I learned about patience and taking my time in doing what I needed to get done to go home. We switched managers over the time that I was there and it was for the best because our new management wwas the best person in the world. I loved Brad, he had all of our backs and anything we needed he was there for us. SO basically like a working father of some sort! The hardest part of the job would have to be the constant having to quit stocking and rush to the register because it kept backing up, the other cashiers were a little slower than others. The most fun part of the job was opening and closing because I got extra hours and I also got to hangout with my coworkers and we always made our job fun for us."
good,Not a bad job going into work never seemed to be a chore. Not a very hard job. Pretty laid back company I enjoyed stocking shelf's more so than being a cashier but all around a good job.
good,Normally I would come in and immediately go to a cash register and begin checking out customers and sacking their items and groceries. What I learned was how the store operated. Management was nice and always helpful. The hardest part of the job for me was keeping the shelves organized because the store was at peak customer volume during this period. The most enjoyable part was feeling productive at the end of the day and getting to work as a team.

good,it was a great place to work.everybody work together as a team .the staff all look out for each other .they also had a lot of hours so it was a lot of overtime and chances for you to move up in the company .

good,nothing really hard about the job just a good place to work and meet good people. You can learn a lot just being around other people. good management and positive working area
good,"A typical work day at dollar tree would include working the register as back up to the cashier. Providing a comfortable and structured working experience for everyone on the team. Maintaining a safe and  productive environment for the shopping customer and staff. I learned that even with a daily plan and organization sometimes things don't always go as planned but it is up to the manager to keep things in order and improvise as needed. The hardest part of the job was having a steady work load. That did not exist really. You have to be able to multitask, improvise, and maintain a stable work environment for other staff members and the shoppers. While keeping good customer service experience on the top of the list. I enjoyed being apart of a diverse community of people who became my second family. They made the job experience worth while."

No room to be idle, but I like it that way because it makes the time go by faster. Training was easy, very flexible hours due to having a good understanding manager."
good,"Great environment, people are friendly and hours are very flexible! The atmosphere is quite pleasant and co-workers are willingly to provide help without wavier."

good,"My typical day at work was fairly easy. I only worked part time so I was scheduled to come in at 7 am. and I was off by 1 pm.  I worked as cashier mainly but some days i would come in for overtime as a stocker, which was not hard at all."
