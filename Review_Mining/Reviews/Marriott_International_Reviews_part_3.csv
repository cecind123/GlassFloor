In the meantime, the Chief Engineers in the area have come together to find a way for me to pick up hours at their sites until my original hotel reopens this year. They have gone out of their way to keep me employed through Starwood, something that I have not seen in other companies. Also, transferring between hotels was as easy as filling out paperwork. Though I am sure they have their flaws, I am thankful to not have to experience many of them first-hand."
