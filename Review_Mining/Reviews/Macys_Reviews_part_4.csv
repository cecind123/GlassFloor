I also learned different ways of satisfying customers, and how to upsell different products. The management team was very good and always willing to help out.  There was always at least two shift managers for various shifts and they could quickly be at different departments without having to wait a long time.  The hardest part I believe is having customers complain about how certain things were on sale when they weren't and confusion of prices for certain items. The most enjoyable part with be meeting people from different countries, and the many different personalities you come across."

Management is fair to the customers and to the employees. They always do whats right for the customer, employees and for the company. They are always available when needed. My co-workers always are good team workers. Always available when needed and we work together helping each other make our goals. The hardest part of the job is when we are not able to find a customers size, however we do have a system that can locate the item for them. We can also search and send to the customers home.

The job was not difficult for me because I am a very personal person and got along with everyone so all my employees would listen to what I had to say. We worked hard as a team to meet our goals and keep the store organized so customers would have an enjoyable time shopping in a clean store.

We were given a goal each day on how many trucks they hoped to complete by the end of our shifts. If we met the goal early we were able to take it a little easier. However, if we didn't meet the quota in time we were asked to stay until we did. Never forced, they would ask us individually if we could stay til we were done."

good,"I just started working at Macys in July and I love it.  In the short time I have worked there I have learned a lot about retail.  I am part of the support team.  We set sale signs with the new sale prices, and move items to discount rack.  Another thing I do is markdowns.  When an item is markdowned it gets a sticker that is printed with a new price and put on the items ticket.  The hardest part of my job was the second week I was there and I was asked to work all night to help with inventory.  There was about 15 other employees working that night along with management counting every item in the store.  We worked for 12 hours.  Even though we were all tired it was rewarding knowing that we got everything done.  The best thing I like about my job is knowing I am helping people get the best possible price for their purchase.  I enjoy working at Macys but I am looking for another part time job to suppliment what I already have."

I would usually clean out fitting rooms, process payments for purchases and returns and organize the clothing areas. I learned quite a few while working at Macy's. Operating a cash register is one. I also learned that location is key. For example, putting for sale and percentages off signs on all the racks full of clothes and on all of the entrances. Management were able to work with their fellow associates. They all had a part in making their sales goals and ringing up customers. Management were there whenever I needed help with a customer or with a register. My coworkers were real easy to get along with, and that is important in working in a social environment. Teamwork is one of the main reasons why stores like Macy's become successful, by the work of all the workers combined. The hardest part of the job was trying to keep your customers satisfied. Keeping customers happy is another main reason why Macy's will continue to succeed in years to come. Loyal customers are what all businesses need to run a successful company.
