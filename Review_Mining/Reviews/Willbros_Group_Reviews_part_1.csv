rating,review
bad,Extremely disorganized company business units are a disaster. They have people in roles that are not knowledgeable skilled or Advanced enough to be placed in those rules. A lot of shoot-from-the-hip rules and programs developed. No alignment within the organization.
bad,by far the worst company ive ever worked for. my pay is wrong every week management treats you like a dog
bad,They lied about the job. They advertised testing in the lab but needed 50 + people for a sunoco project in remote Pennsylvania. The job was unsafe the company truck broke down . . .
bad,job was behind from the start. KBR and Flint had all ready been removed from the project. So we really had to execute it correctly. this project got Willbros a lot of extra work. it just happened to be when the industry crashed.
bad,"Be in the back pocket of your manager or you get blacked balled within the company, regardless of your skill level. One sided when it comes to rules. No open communication. Even though a open door policy is stated, this is not true."
bad,The only thing that is close to a family oriented company is there is away to much family there and you can bet when you got all the hard work done there family will move to the top to accept the credit and you will be tossed to the curb unless they get stuck again
bad,"The bad attitude starts at the very top with the electrical division of this gong show. First day there the project manager comes in yelling and cursing out the entire staff, this was a trend as his brother (a super) days later came in cursing and screaming about parts being left in trucks and this being the reason there are no materials to work with, nothing to do with the ineptitude of management naturally. "
bad,"management was terrible, never had parts, and just out of the blue laid everyone off with no warning."
bad,"If you are not an engineer there is no moving up. There is a group of old timers there and they don't want anyone to get ahead. There is a group of designers that can come in when the want, do what they want and say what they want. But, if you're not in that group you need to watch what you say, come in on time and keep your head down. You probably won't be able to retire from this job because of the lay-offs. They aren't a stable company."
bad,Has the potential to be a great company; sadly this won't ever happen. Dreadful safety culture. Poor management structure-Friends getting friends jobs-foremen and general foremen are clueless and run from one catastrophe to another. Weed and strippers seem to be much more of a priority than providing a good product for the client.
bad,a typical day consist of going to work with a job scope needing to get done with no hiccups and working with people who can help you get through various tasks with out any complications and the ability to fix any complications with minimum time delay
bad,"A typical day at work was always interesting because of the engineering challenges each day.  I learned much more about knowing computer skills.  Also, I learned a lot on how pipelines should function.  The management was great.  Management was always open to new ideas.  I had the best co-workers to work with on any new project.  Each worker was always there to help the other worker when something new came up to be resolved. The hardest part of the job was when our customers would changes their minds on when the project should be completed. The most enjoyable part of the job was when our customer would write a letter and say "" job well done ""."
bad,"The company may not be in business at the time of this review.  The company was spinning off its constructions business and trying to survive with its only segment. Having started as a construction business, this essentially ended WilBros Construction company as a Construction company"
bad,"was injured at work and after being placed on workman comp was terminated "
bad,"Poor co-workers, bad attitudes"
bad,This compsny isnt whst it says it is. Ive been with company and have seen mo good changes. If you overhead or linemsn or underground thrres room to grow and make money. But the ecu group gets worked 16 plus hours easily fired and cant advance any further than Forman. Not to mention they dont want to pay employees raises. If your young and want no life the its good for you. But to make the money you have to work more than 80 hrs a week just to make a decent living. On top of that they claim to have a buddy system but only use it when it convenient.  They cant even get enough people to make full crews. They over work and dont care they do so. I came tk this company for better life and wanting to help make a chsnge. But whst ive learned is that we are expendable to them. As far as the coworkers. Most are good but as i feel most are tired of job being threatened by uppers to do things they know is wrong. Rules flex according to jobs and crews.
bad,Did not follow up with clients to give them a quality product. Management team made excuses than to fix the issues. The pipeline integrity and corrosion department was managed by a director that had no experience in the field of Cathodic protection or pipeline integrity. He was clueless.
bad,"it was fun while it last each on it own, depending on which crew you work with"
bad,"Overtime for salaried personnel is expected.  Project load often split between offices.  Offices have differing procedures, methods, etc. which requires extensive O.T. to correct."
bad,Worked for wilbros in the e and I department. Extremely poor management more concerned about getting their buddies promoted than doing the job correctly. I was a foreman and quit after watching the project manager promote his friends while the company lost millions. Worst company in the patch for electrical.
bad,"If you are looking for an office environment where the hard workers thrive and advance and have career stability, look elsewhere. They let good people go and save the lazy workers."
bad,Company is not up to par as an EPC unit.  Many inexperienced people and the company has financial problems. Unable to secure contracts due to pricing problems.
bad,"they have big problem in management, organizing and communication with the workers.Each ppl they hired they told them the project just for 3 months then when we started working they said it will be last after month so they got laid off 40 ppl some of them they didnt complete 1 week.I didn't feel comfortable in morning meeting cuz the lunch trail is very small to fit almost 100 electricians. They pay good wage but still need more time to solve the mentioned problems and to develop themselves"
bad,Seemed that the older personnel were fired while younger people kept their jobs. Very unfair especially considering that they were bringing other personnel on at the same time.
bad,"Pay is good , that'a about it. You do get to learn new piping facility work, But management is the absolute worse I've ever seen. And believe me it all starts with management."
bad,"Like every thing, ""...always could be better"""
bad,"Poor decisions by upper management caused massive layoff."
bad,"The supervisors, Formans, don't know how to handle people. They don't listen to some suggestions to lessen the works and make it easier and save money for the company. They don't put the right people in the job to minimize error and repetition of works. It's a waste of money when they cut short the cables."
bad,"Not a stable company to work for. I would not recommend."
bad,"Major complaint is that all equipment is old and needs to be refurbished. When you have to fix vehicles so TxDOT doesn't pull you over before you leave to go to a job site, there is a problem."
bad,Typical for industrial construction in the Oil and Gas sector.  Management was slow to react and only got involved when there were challenges.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the co-operation and professionalism of my co-workers.
bad,"Poor Management, decisions making, skills ,experience and general lack of talent. On a continuous losing streak. Cant wint any projects. cant compete any projects while simultaneously making a profit. Old school dinosaurs with no modern new school skills. Pipeline company cant make any money on a pipeline project. indecisive, continually revolving door with poor procedures, amateur level cost controls and unskilled untrained project execution teams."
bad,Willbros gave me a chance to learn my craft as a safety ad visor and I appreciated that very much. Willbros needs to provide more direction and safety training for the safety ad visors in the field. Training has been cut back due to slow down in the oil industry
bad,"le'ezafaire mgmnt , underskilled mgmnt, no eqmnt, no PLI infastructure, sent out to job site with no eqmnt , meant well but over matched for task @ hand"
good,"acceptable.  smart people  behind on technology Can not manage well lay-offs all the time"
good,Started off being a nice place to work. To many people were made Managers only because they were kin or knew the president of the company.
good,"Very Difficult supervisors, each with different way of doing things and each one told you to complete tasks differently.  Upper management did not like workers coming to them with issues on the job."
good,"Not very organized, simple projects never delivered on schedule and always over budget"
good,"It was a positive work experience. I had worked there for years; in those years, i grew and learned new skills I was given opportunities to move up and took the challenges presented, and excelled"
good,The office I worked in is no longer open. Office manager was offered a partnership at another company and left this office with several key employees. Without necessary staff the parent company closed this office and eventually was sold to another giant engineering firm.
good,"Most enjoyable part of coming to work and working on various sites was meeting lots of different people, so many nice and friendly people made it fun to come to work everyday."
good,"Great working environment, made you feel at home, the AP Department was supervised well. Moved to another location once the company merged, it was great for awhile until they lad off some people and I was one of the layoffs."
good,"Away from home always."
good,When I worked for them it was near the end of a boom season and it was a hectic environment.  Lots of challenging work situations and lots of big personalities to deal with on a daily basis.
good,"It's a big company. The company works all over North America "
good,"My ""typical day"" isn't always a typical one, which kind of keeps things interesting. "
good,"Is it a good company to work for,but the main issue the projects are short term and you get laid off. is hard to live in Fort McMurray working for this company. No job security"
good,A typical day at work would be fusing pipe spotting lines I have learned a lot about pie line work in the short time I have been there. My supervisor is strict on safety and all my co workers are easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job is being in the sun and dust on windy days and the most enjoyable part of the job is working on cloudy cold days.
good,"I enjoy working here, for the most part. But, I want any chance of advancement, I need to look else ware. They would rather hire on new people (family and friends) than promote perfectly qualified employees for new positions. This business is growing...rapidly! So, job security isn't an issue..."
good,"the people are great, the work doesn't seem to be constant. Myself and others end up charging to overhead most of the time."
good,"My Review has no bearing on whether I'm looking for work, in the same manner companies will not issue private information about the individual. My opinion about said company good or bad will not be posted."
good,"I had an awesome group to work with through the 2 years with this company. Unfortunately, some of the management that were hired to run jobs were utterly incompetent. I'm speculating, but that could have been a reason why the work dried up completely when the market crashed while some companies were still able to keep some guys busy."
good,"you were always wondering if it was your last day there or not."
good,"Great field personnel working hard to perform professionally.  Mind on task, with no limit to effort provided.  Difficult to receive support from corporate office.  Bogged down by details, rather than the true objective, and customer service."
good,"The people I worked with were nice and good to work with.  Accountability was lacking.  Leadership questionable.  it was good experience, but ready to move on."
good,"Shop was not a great place to work. I had personal information exposed by individuals who broke into my desk drawer. Management at the shop seemed to be out of touch with production activities and quality concerns. "
good,Worked in the Marketing Department and learned alot about preparing bids for international jobs.  They encouraged me to take computer courses that I needed to do my job.
good,i enjoyed my time here had lots of good experience worked with a lot of good people. As an apprentice was given lots of opportunity to learn new skills
good,It was an good company to work for until the oil crisis.  They let you work without someone standing over your shoulder and they have your back in a time of need.
good,I had a good learning experience with Willbros. They treated me good and help teach me a lot about work and life. Working there as an apprentice in welding showed me how hard that life is and made me realize what I have to do to become a better one myself.
good,"a typical day at work was to design piping and other related to the oil and gas industry, varied from skid designs to tanking facilities, learned more about cad works and auto cad, spent a good amount of time in the field doing walk downs on P&ID's, hardest part of my job was to please the client with various modifications in the design, enjoy what I do."
good,10 to 12 hr. a day 6 days a week. management looked after people. great co-workers. hardest part working 6 days a week is getting personal cares taken  care of. most enjoyable working with great people
good,"its pipeline work what else can i say if you dont like the heat, cold or rain or mud then don't do it"
good,The Extreme harsh work environment was one of the hardest elements of the job to deal with along with the stress levels and the physical aspect.  The benefits that this company provided far exceeded any other company.
good,built the ert staion. was really good. worked nights and banged it out. only problem was civil work wasnt planned in accordance with production afterwards so we couldnt continue until ground prep and piles were pounded
good,I found the company to be very good to there employees. Everyone at the company got along great very little problems between workers
good,Company is about the productivity and numbers per month. Overall staff are enjoyable to be with. At times can be a strenuous place to deal with customers and management is not always supportive.
good,I really enjoyed the people who work with this company. There are groups of people who really care about their job and love what they do and work together as a team.
good,"great place to work, hard industry given the current economy. I had worked with a great group of people while I was there, most of whom still work there."
good,"Place is okay environment, just the business shows favoritism to other staff. They need to treat people with respect, and not show favoritism to higher up staff members."
good,"Typical day of work was very productive and busy.  Balancing time sensitive items, emergency requests and basic doc control duties.  Worked in a small office within a large company."
good,I loved working at Willbros.  My position was great and I was on my own to run a team for office services and help with facilities.  I also did a bit of procurement.
good,"Provide skills, knowledge, and assistance to party chief to accomplish daily tasks"
good,Communication issues at the highest level. Then getting hollered at to almost getting ran into by Forman’s truck.  The company in general seems like a great company. Just not the place for me
good,Excellent place to work.  Upper management were real people. No egos.  Would work for them again.  The relaxed atmosphere encouraged productivity.  Only draw back was work/life balance.
good,"keeps you working"
good,I've worked for a few different companies and this one has been one of the best companies that I've worked for.  They have great people and terrific management as well as a very good safety program.
good,"Working in corporate accounting taught me a lot of new things such as pay attention to detail and I gained a wealth of knowledge, a typical work day would be close, reconciliations or working on a new project how ever there was little place for advancement."
good,"working on various pipeline projects the work was professionally executed, good on managing different crews and sub contractors at different locations"
good,"Good place to work, management is great"
good,"I sat at my desk all day doing my work, and helping out others when they needed it. They were lenient with time, on when you could show up. The management was great, always looking out for your best interest. the co-workers were good to work with."
good,this company paid well but didn't manage their upper management personnel very well and this is why the company went under and had to sell themselves to someone else.
good,"Great workplace with awesome leadership, we had fun with what we did. When needed to be serious we were and enjoyed doing our job.  The company was all about safety and that was a key part of the work environment. They had lots of task changes and deadlines which made it interesting."
good,"I love my coworkers. Currently the company is going through a tough time... I currently work with people in another office.. it's often times like playing telephone with coworkers, very unorganized, the Tulsa team is resistant to change"
good,"work on piping drawings using cadworx"
good,They had a great team of leaders and treated you good . I  had a structural foreman spot and the crew was a great bunch and had the support of management . Safety is the number one priority.
good,Since I started working here I have met some pretty awesome people. The people here have become like a second family to me.
good,"Hard working team where everyone works hard to get the job done.  Flexible hours, beginning at 6:30AM.   Wonderful management and diverse staff. Fair and visionary leadership. I would recommend this company to a friend."
good,Worked up in Fort McMurray Alberta . Worked on civil but job came to a end . Was a two week in one week out schedule so it was an awesome schedule . Guy actually had a life .
good,"a typical day at willbros goes as follows:"

good,"Willbros does good work and it was a pleasure to work with the team and build the portfolio of constructions projects."
good,"Morning Meeting and Wrote FLRAs"
good,Willbros was a great entry into the pipelining industry. I truly enjoyed my time there and all of my coworkers.
good,This has been my summer job for the past three summers and I've always had a great time. I've been trained to use different tools and their safety culture.
good,"I Was on afternoon / night shift, supporting two welding crews with materials. I had various extra duties including loading trailers and staging orders for day shift both loading and for shop orders."
good,Very good company to work for for a young man and a family man pay is great especially on storm work very hard work most of the time. But very hot and cold
good,"Working in Wilbors provided offshore experience of a life time, just like others multi culture and hardest is when you are offshore with militants attack"
good,enjoyed working with this company for 4 years would gladly go back lots of hours but a good place to work big company and room to grow
good,The job involved long hours and physical work most days.  The compensation was very good though and as long as you are a good people person it can be a very beneficial experience.
good,"I enjoy working a Willbros, i learned alot about the Gas/oil industry. i am currently looking because they will probably close our office soon."
good,"Fair company, good work atmosphere and a good group of guys to work with. Company Benefits, Safety Orientated and family balanced"

good,"Busy days. Shifts start with informational meetings and end with a debrief meeting."

good,my days consisted reading blue prints and doing lay out.Ilearned to how to read blue prints and run an a.w.p.the guys were all good to work with and it was enjoyable on the nice weather days.
good,Mapping department is a good place to work and learn about CAD and MicroStation.  Great people work there.  The GIS is a little weak but the mapping is strong.  They take good care of their employees.  Good positive atmosphere.  Lots of help from co-workers.  Good management in mapping department.
good,"I really enjoyed the environment that I worked in and I learned a lot of useful skills. My foremans and general foreman cared about their crews and tried to accommodate us as much as they could. All and all, it is a really great company."
good,Willbros is a very safety concerned company. Learned a lot about gas pipeline construction process.
good,"Able to work very closely with construction team and upper management at the same time.  I was exposed to all aspects of the project that I was on, giving me a broad range of valuable knowledge of how a project is executed from start to finish.  The company provided me with the opportunity to work out in the field and be exposed to how construction on pipelines in done in the real world not just on paper.  Great place to work and gain filed experience."
good,"Worked at the mod yard. I got in on t he pipe fab end of things. Seeing as how I didn't have a pressure ticket I had to pretty much be a pipe fitter for the whole duration of that job. I had to read and progress my isos. I also had to prep, fit and bridge tack pipe. I also had to set lines on mods and set projections."
good,"I worked with Willbros a few years back. Honestly, it was the best company I’ve ever worked for. There was one horrible employee to work with, but this person got let go, so now the work atmosphere is probably SO much better. I highly recommend this company."
good,"It was Ok, should have been a permanent  assignment liked many people there, The project manager I worked under was an eg-maniac that I had t endured every single day, but management allowed him to treat everyone that way, it was an ongoing joke"
good,One of the best company's i have worked for by far and would love the opportunity to work for them again. Most money i made with any company and best safety culture.
good,I enjoyed my time at Willbros and only left due to the fact that a new opportunity came along.  This company is no longer in business so I cannot recommend it.

good,This was a great place to work until some company financial issues caused some of our client to be concerned with company potential going out of business.
good,Willbro's was a great place to work throughout my apprenticeship. They were understanding and patient as ai grew as a worker and was able to develop many skills. I would defiantly work for this company again if the opportunity had rose.
good,"Awesome place to work. Learned lots every day, everyone is happy and always helpful which was great. Hardest thing about working was the very cold weather but you were given warm up breaks which was good."
good,The people that I worked with were good most of the time the management system was flawed with promote your buddy to foreman but when the work was solid it was a good place to work.
good,Allowed to perform freely while learning to advance in your position. My co-workers were the tops!  The hardest part about the job was making sure reports were sent in by my field crews but the most enjoyable part of the my job was getting to know the people that worked for me!
