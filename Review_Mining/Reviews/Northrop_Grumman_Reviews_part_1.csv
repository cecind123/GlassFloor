rating,review
bad,"Required to enter something here.  Great place to work. Great Culture. Learned a lot about business development.  Very enjoyable, good learning environment, good challenges."
bad,"If you have no job experience this is company for you. They provide you the entire world and look good on your resume with big company. Managers have no skills set except just send daily reminder to do timesheet. Corp events were silly too they provide nothing and want employees to bring foods and drinks. My project where managers were clueless and clients just bypass them. Also, corporate culture was bad too which bring morale down"
bad,"Moving out of state like the company, like the people I work for and with . They do need to work on benefits for there employees. Upper management is a good old boys club."
bad,totally lousy company don't waste your time trying to get in they treat people like they don't mean anything very demanding with nothing to be thankful for most people feel disgusted working there.
bad,"NG had a good culture back in 2007 for people that aren't social or right brain creative people. They're looking for people that don't want stimulation outside of their day to day responsibilities. The mentality is that you sit in your cube and don't bother others just do your work. For some this might be perfect, for me I like to enjoy the people around me."
bad,"Horrible management, forced mandatory overtime even on days off with no consideration for appointments made on scheduled days off.   They felt you should only think about the job."
bad,Poor leadership and management especially on the classified side. There was no clear direction on many occasions and the amount of nepotism in the company is atrocious.
bad,"No Job security, was in training a week and was told the assignment ended.  Terrible work schedule and no benefits since they only hire in through contractors."
bad,"Joke of a place to work.  Terrible management, ineffective processes, poor pay and benefits, and, worst of all, under-achievers are promoted over those actually accomplishing objectives."
bad,The rating is so low not due to my direct manager but rather the director of my group.  This person undermines every decision and only worries about her favorites.
bad,"The 80s and 90s were the cutting edge times in software for TRW/Northrop Grumman in Redondo Beach.  It was a great cultural place to balance work and raise a family.  For example, airline tix were always fully changeable (no questions asked) so minimal time was spent on the road.  Then the culture changed in the early 2000s about the time of NG's TRW acquisition.  Starting software engineers would not want to dedicate say 5-10 or more years of career as the commercial software tech industry started to compete and NG management didn't keep up with the salary and bonuses offered by the commercial industry. Example: NG's ""time in place"" type of policies (e.g. no promotion until X years in place regardless of superior performance, innovation or contribution).  This left a huge gap between the number of older engineers (45+) and the mid-level-to-younger engineers.  The Government with all of its regulatory requirements was often snail-paced slow to adopt new software technologies (e.g. agile) -- often due to contract structure or international sourcing. This caused 45-55 workers to be overbalanced as a population and salary capped with little to no ability to be promoted (unless someone retired and you were lucky enough to slot in). Starting software engineers salaries today are remarkably lower than starting commercial salaries. I left after 30 years but before retirement age.  I had enough. Thankfully I am the recipient of a pension -- something else that no longer exists."
bad,"I did not like this company. It was extremely secretive and even the full time employees were not informed about the direction, priorities or standards of the company."
bad,No comment. The company's contract I was going to work on was being managed as if it was ten years in the past. Regarding maintenance and modernization practices - the building I worked in had been neglected. The experience has me hoping that I will never work for another private government contractor again.
bad,I didnt sign up to rate all these past companies. I dont remember much about this place other than they hired me and I did my job and excelled at it. Ok
bad,"not worth the time or effort to wrier how they mistreat, stab in back step on you to advance no teamwork, manages them selves, and targeting employees is rampant. Ask any former Northrop employee that was dismissed. no matter how long you were there or how many good reviews, if you are not liked por manager feels threatened by you in a work sense you can be targeted for termination."
bad,Did not emphasize retaining contract employees. Did not train for ground run.Armed Guards did not understand English. Was sick twice in the hospital while on tour. For three years the company is still reporting on my taxes that I lived in MD. I have never lived in MD.
bad,It was ok ...It was on a army base ...It was very cut throat snitches everywhere ....So I would tread lightly when working there. They will fire you over any little thing espically if your not in the click
bad,"-very dysfunctional and slow processes"
bad,"Management in my opinion didn’t handle situations in a professional manner, making myself feel like I was no good, didn’t give positive encouragement, as well as made me have lack of motivation."
bad,"Northrop Grumman Saint Augustine has become, because of the unrealistic production expectations, a sweat shop. They bring people in with little or no experience, give them a couple of days of training and put them on the floor. Then they(management) want to know why the scrap and repair rate are so high."
bad,Interesting projects and good co-workers. The communication with management needs improvement. The company paid for my graduate degree. This was a very good benefit.
bad,bad place to work wasted 4 yrs go to work no one knows whats going on were to go or what to do upper management sucked had no ideal what they were doing.
bad,"It is boring Place to work no grows, no training and layoff older employees to reduce cost. Managers only care about themselves not employees. I won't recommend anyone to work there."
bad,This was the most stressful job I have ever had. Each day wondering when you may be laid off after putting in 110%. Cost me everything and more. Do not appt here
bad,"Northrop Grumman was an awful place to work. Shady management, poor ethics. I would never consider working for them ever again. I have not disliked many places in my life, but I hated this company"
bad,Northrop was not a good fit for me. People were constantly leaving or being fired. I could not work autonomously as I was told during my interview. Assignment were constantly being shifted from one person to another.
bad,"Extremely political,"
bad,"job is fairly relaxing, but the supervisor always try to bug, stay overlooking your shoulder for supervisor because they try to get you into some kind of trouble to cover their back, because most of them don't know what their doing."
bad,Management was non-existent. Emails went unanswered and management was rarely on site. Issues were never resolved and passed on. The job I interviewed for was NOT the job I received. 9 out of 10 days I was lucky to have 2 hours of work. They only care about billing for your butt in the seat
bad,I was never given enough work.  There were to many admins. working in one group.  The job was not what I expected.  I will never work there again.  It didn't meet my expectations.
bad,"Bad management; inadequate staff. cheap for for high prices."
bad,"don't work here very toxic environment, only suitable for white males"
bad,"The most un-ethical  place I have ever worked. Terrible place to work . Very de-grading to employees. Very clickish, and if your not in the click you are nothing to them."
bad,"Too many hours, too much pressure and not enough support.  Management too quick to provide negative feedback.  Overall, this is just my opinion and it may only apply to my sector and line of work."
bad,Worked directly with Members of Congress and Congressional staff. Interacting with people and achieving substantial results were the most enjoyable parts of my job.
bad,company was fined for pesticide spraying and never compensated any injured employees. Managers were fined and severely warned for repeated wrong behavior but never terminated or disciplined.
bad,"Conduct testing with: IRS test environment staff, the AIR development team, the AIR systems engineers, "
bad,"Was once a good place to work.  Northrop reduced or eliminated benefits.  Merit increases are poor, usually 1.5 % if that.  Cutthroat environment."
bad,"Xetron in Cincinnati was a great company until Northrop rolled in and ruined it.  Now it is a toxic work environment, extremely poor raises, weakened or eliminated benefits."
bad,"A shipbuilding company that is no longer in operations, but prepared me for my current career path and offered me great life skills."
bad,"Very difficult to work with a company that has Tribal Knowledge, no room for growth or formal training, and does not promote education as a benefit and allow for higher education."
bad,"Worked Logistics, Finance, Proposal Development.  Worked on Navy;s latest Unmanned 'aerial vehicle, liked being on cutting edge of technology"
bad,"Excellent, very good place to work, flexible, good knowledgeable coworkers, provides training, supportive management"
bad,"Nice pay, good hours. If your not a ""Northrop Employee"" your basically disposable. you get no benefits at all while your a contractor and most are required to be contractors at least 3 yrs before being considered for ""Full time"". The management is very poor and they do not support recently returning combat veterans struggling with PTSD or any other disability,all that happens is you becoming a hassle for Northrop Grumman and when its time to let you go, your supervisor takes the day off and they call you after work to let you know that was your last day. No warning, no courtesy 2 weeks NOTHING. EXTREMELY POOR UPPER MANAGEMENT"
bad,Not the same company it used to be. Cutting everything they can from employees. Little to no opportunities for advancement.
bad,"Typical day was always the same. Co-workers were cool, managment could never make up their mind always changing the way they want things done. Hardest part of the job was getting there the best part was the end of the day."
bad,"Northrop Grumman is a horrible place to work.  Most new employees only stay there 1-5 years.  Some new employees even leave before reaching their first year!  Abysmal Attrition Rate - Northrop Grumman cannot keep new talent."
bad,send me a note and I'll share these with you.  Poor management and no team work.  I couldn't to leave and found the rest of the world was in the 21st century
bad,"I was personally displeased with the benefits department and their rudeness. Never really received a packet for benefits enrollment and when i called about it, they said there was nothing i could do to enroll becase i missed my date."
bad,"Company is way to big.  Employees are just a number.  Unqualified management, poor decision making, no care for employee retention, no promoting from within.  Poor choice to work here."
bad,"NGC is a great place to start your career.  But advancement is reserved for clicks, not for dedicated, hard workers.  If you are not in the click, then no advancement for you."
bad,"Dont care about Employees, this compnay is ONLY for themselves."
bad,"	Provided customer support and repair. Repaired desktops, laptops, servers and printers."
bad,"Northrop Grumman Corporation - Technical Services."
bad,"i did like nothing here but the checks, it just made so hard for a women to work comforable"
bad,Providing quality training to America's fighting forces.
bad,Working for Northrop Grumman as a subcontractor sucks. Because you don't get a lot of benefits and you have go through these steps to become a Northrop Grumman employee. 1) Subcontractor 2) Company contractor 3) Company employee.
bad,"After 73+ years, the shipyard is closing. The company was purchased by Litton Ind, which proceeded to put their struggling shipyard division, Ingall's Shipbuilding, in control of the thriving Avondale facility. The Litton company was later purchased by Northrop Grumman which allowed Ingall's to remain in control. Ingall's took over Avondale's naval contracts and through bad business practices, ran the business at a loss. Northrop Grumman has since separated from the gulf coast shipyards and is closing Avondale completely and selling the company."
bad,Management was terrible and the contract was in its declining phase. My direct manager was fired due to ethics violations. The work life balance was not good and there was no PM support.
bad,"Horrible pay, over worked and no job security. Come in to work very early and leave very late. Management does not help and there seems to be alot of negativity in the work place. Older people work there but there are some younger people too. It's a glorified factory job no matter if you work in an office or factory floor."
bad,You people are laying off folks left and right.
bad,"As someone who has worked for this company for over 10 years and then let go, please know that your job here could easily be gone tomorrow. Why? All jobs at NG are funded by government contracts. If you are a recent college grad, you may think you're on top of the world with a position at Northrop. But as you age and grow, with possibly a family with kids to feed, your job could easily be gone in a heartbeat. I know this personally. Be very warned."
bad,Great place to work everyday. People that cared about the work.
bad,"To many supervisors and to few shift workers. Many supervisors base judgments on rumor, speculation and gossip. Good place for a politician to work, technically competent personnel should seek employment elsewhere."
bad,"Fast pace-quick turn around, proactive and innovative. Learned to use a out-of-the box think pattern and share with team members, which was always appreciated/respected by co-workers and management. Working with a management team that recognizes and puts together people based on their talent. Work closely as a team to drive first pass sucess. Ensuring that all suppliers stay in compliance with the Northrop Grumman quality system. Flexible hours and ability to balance work and life."
bad,i currently work for them at northdrop gruman and it is horrible and truly disorganized on a massive scale currently my schedule is 6 days a week with 9 to 10 hr days with a 5am call time and they use the fact that your a temp to take advantage of you
bad,"Working personnel not personable and unwillingly to extend themselves in training other to perform duties.  Too busy for adequate training."
bad,"I'm currently looking for new career at other companies. Expectations unrealistic,, Micro Management environment!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
bad,"Make sure when you interview you ask all your questions in relation to the tasks and duties of your position. They did a bait n switch with me and HR acknowledged it during exit interview.  They do not staff up in relation to the amount of work needed to be done.  Be prepared for useless agile meetings (scrum) everyday that add zero value and take away your time from actually performing your tasks.  They want to know what you will be doing every moment of the day, this is the NG culture.  Be prepared to be in a stressful environment all day long."
bad,"Hands down, Northrop Grumman Orlando is the worst place I've ever worked. It is the epitome of  a toxic work environment. The work/employee company culture leaves much to be desired. Management/Leadership is atrocious. They do not care about their employees. Employees are undervalued, underpaid, and unappreciated. Did I mention significantly underpaid? The facility has been plagued with rats, roaches, ants, bats, mold, roof leaks, flooding, broken office furniture, boxes blocking aisles and passageways, fire hazards, OSHA Hazard. It has been an absolute disgrace. The Business Unit embraces diversity from the top but it ends there. NG Discovery Drive is lead and managed by The Good 'Ol Boys/Brotherhood. Female Engineers are continuously disrespected and maltreated. HR is ineffective and absolutely useless. It is unorganized. No process for anything. It takes jumping through 10 flaming hoops to get anything done. It is ran like a starter upper company rather than a multi-billion dollar Enterprise Defense Corporation. I would not recommend this location to my worse enemy. There is NO loyalty. It is a cut throat backstabbing environment. The second you leave a room, people/ team members will slander you just to elevate themselves. Attrition has been extremely high here over the past year for a reason."
bad,"-Horrible management that micro manages and write you up for small mistakes and uses that to beat up on you and justify not giving you a pay raise.  You don't get any thank you for all the hard work you do and get written up for it. Basically functional homeroom is your judge, jury and executioner for your career which is why I and many others left the company here in Melbourne. I dont advise anybody to work here in Melbourne. If you want your career ruined then apply here."
bad,This place is a joke they lost my 401k wouldn’t pay it back management is horrible if it doesn’t benefit them they won’t work with you and HR don’t even get me start same thing anything to cover the company’s butt I was target for harassment and my locker was broken in to paint poured on my personal property so I went to HR they said they looked at cameras seen nothing and that I was liar when even I had witnesses so this place can eat a peach thanks for skewing me over northropt
bad,"Poor Management, lack of advancement, pay is not acceptable to for the cost of living in the area, HR is no help either.  stressful, more people leave that stay."
bad,The contract was not to hire as presented to me. The company was not honest with the intent to hire me. I never missed a day without prior authorization.
bad,"Highly disorganized company, with little to no infrastructure. Culture is one where the status quo is not challenged, very poor level of accountability, and quality of work."
bad,"Run as fast as you can."
bad,The Management is horrible to work with.  There is no room for advancement.  This job is more like working on a assembly line where everything is a rush.
bad,You are just one of many at NG! They don’t care if you over work our under work! Crying on the job gets you special assignments. This is for sure a mans world type culture. It’s sad that this place used to have such a great reputation but now it’s nowhere near that. They will pull you from another project and then when that project isn’t renewed they will tell you to find a new position but won’t actually help you find one!
bad,"No raises, no communication. You work till you drop and consequences be damned if you ruin their safety streak. They dont care about you only to look good."
bad,The company was all about business and the people were not very collaborative.  Not much more to say.  One two three four five six seven eight nine ten
bad,"Changes in management have resulted in an environment where everyone is watching their back and getting thrown under the bus is an everyday occurrence. In many instances, workloads have doubled or more. Cost and schedule are suffering,"
bad,"Should have gone with gut feeling and left sooner. Complete Program Management swap out with new hires, that clearly were not qualified. Known problems need to be rectified. When addressing, with a fix, get in trouble for pointing out the obvious and ostracized. Was hired to make constructive changes  Every step of the way was hit head on with “That’s how it’s always been done” or “That’s what the customer expects” or lame excuses of requirements are meant by untrue means that have some how been accepted by management, auditors and/or the customer. Favoritism is rampant. Family members get an easy in, regardless of ability to do work. Those who are not capable just get passed around from job to job. There’s a reason why proposals that were expected to be awarded are not. It’s finally catching up to the truth of things and it’s not pretty. Guess I have finally realized why the company buys out other companies, it’s because they don’t have the talent/know how. What an epiphany. Run, run away as fast as you can. Avoid the quicksand."
bad,"In order to enough people to fulfil the contract, NG had people apply to false requisition then had them do nothing and apply to get jobs internally. Hiring managers sometimes knew and at other times did not know and would hire external candidates instead."
bad,"I tell you no matter hard you work (I can tell for IT/IS sector) no matter how you're, it doesn't work here.  For them you're just a number who's bringing money for them.  They don't even bother asking if you're interested in climbing up a leader. Again, here it's not what you know it's who you know."
bad,"I think there are a lot of middle tiers of management who simply try to please their bosses without taking care of the engineer's needs when it comes to equipment, direction on projects, and advocacy."
bad,Very cutthrought culture. I’ve interviewed 4-5  (20+year) employees given 30 days to find a job when the well goes dry. Layoffs are common and frequent to replace employees who make too much
bad,"I was hired as a contractor under a 5 year but did not even seen the first year. "
bad,"This job overworked me 60 plus hours a week 6 days a week.. "
bad,"Northrop Grumman dose not hire Facilities Maintenance people you have to come in as a contractor and I don't like it!!!!! Way underpaid and I have to attend 8 buildings by my SELF!!!!! Very little tools, and they don't like spending money for thinks you need. Poor shop with very loud air compressor. No air conditioning. Very HOT in shop!!!"
bad,"Horrible place to work. The company is stuck in the past, there is more bureaucracy here than in Washington, DC. They have leaders and hiring managers that have been there 30+ years and REFUSE to change the ways of the past. Huge turnover issues in AS, poor leadership throughout the division, no one communicates what is going on to the field organization, they are depending on their name to attract people which once you join them you realize what a terrible mistake you made. If you want to work in this industry go to Boeing Harris, Raytheon or Lockheed."
bad,"They do not care about people.  You will only be a butt in a seat.  Management sucks!! They only give 1-3% raises a year,  even if you bust your butt off!! If you don't need their insurance, don't expect extra money for that.  The only good (which isn't really good) thing about working there is the 401K, which most companies have.  They only match up to 3% others,  such as Raytheon, Boeing etc is 6%. Run away,  don't walk,  run....look else where,  you'll be glad you did!"
bad,"Complete and total lack of integrity and accountability at all levels of management. Annual employee surveys continue to point to overall discontent and dissatisfaction with the organization. Management's reaction is to form teams to address these issue which result in nothing being done as the issues are greater than what employees can directly fix. Compensation and benefits are a joke. Annual increases have averaged about 0 - 1.5% for the past 4 years with benefits following closely behind. Program Managers run and direct their teams in a very unprofessional and highly disrespectful manner. If they can make you look bad they will. They're only out for themselves and no one else. Good luck getting an ""atta boy""....ever. I could go on but I think you get the picture."
bad,"For a company culture that says they innovate and are forward looking and cutting edge, I have never felt that within the company.  Company leadership stresses engagement with employees, but in reality they're setting unrealistic program timelines and schedule and not utilizing standard engineering practices to save time and reduce costs. "
bad,Very unhappy with the work environment. Everybody unhappy. They want you to work 60 hours but only pay 40 hours. Management mistreats employees. Little to no training. No raises or bonuses.
bad,Extremely unethical and incompetent management. Nothing can compensate for the corrupt culture and negative work environment.
bad,Typical day... nothing to say..Promise to bring on full time and then did not.
bad,For a very large company I have noticed how jobs are not delegated properly and the vast resources (work-force) is not handled approprately.
bad,"I don't enjoy my working experience with Northroup Grumman. Everything is very hands off and non personal. Everyone seems to be laddar climbers and getting training is next to impossible. It seems to be a ""gotcha"" situation every day with them and they don't care about having a good work environment."
bad,Overall the work environment was very poor as the contract was in its declining stages.
bad,TRW was a great company to work for till NGC management rolled in...
bad,"Shady, shady place.  They report your opinion counts but trust me it doesn't.   Minorities must be double brown nosers."
bad,Poor place to work  no support from management  would not recommend to anyone   Stay away  poor management who doesn’t support employees   More worried about surveys than what employers have to s
bad,"Worst place every to work, do not recommend working at Northrop Grumman. Not a fan of the culture, the promotion process and rather not be a part of the company"
bad,"They will offer great pay and benefits, but the management is seriously lacking in organization, management skills and caring about their employees. At times, they have a difficult time getting the job done because they don't hire the right people for the jobs, and people in charge are inexperienced as managers and it shows. Attention to detail is lacking and problems get missed and build up in to bigger problems when they could have been avoided with better management."
bad,This was a bad hire for me and they simply did not know what to do with my skills.  Management did not act when I arrived and I literally did not have a job to do.
bad,"They age discriminate for anyone over 65 or reaching the age of 65."
bad,Radford is the worst place to work. The people are bad and tell on you for no reason. They are childish and will sabotage your work to get you fired. Stay away.
bad,Managers are incompetent and carry many very inappropriate relationships with employees. They play favorites and I suspect are on the take from the few contractors they use. They don't value quality work or people.
bad,As a systems mechanic contactor I was treated like a virus they didn't want to show me the ropes the supervisor for zone 2 on swings is a donkey hole and everyone belittles or thinks they are the best mechanics I. The world they put me on scraping old tape from floor boards everyday it was insulting I'm warning you beware
bad,The culture was very clicky. No advancement opportunities for women. Pay for women was imbalanced. Very stressful.The work environment was not pleasant. Very toxic environment.
bad,"Northrop Grumman was once a proud company that made great things. Now the political climate is one of fear and blame, engagement is lower than ever and older employees are being targeted to leave even though no one ever admits that is what is going on. It is a shame that a company that once valued experience now is so focused on meeting diversity targets that it structures incentives based on meeting these targets. Executive management sets the tone and everyone else follows along. VP's and above have the worst engagement scores and for good reasons."
bad,"good place to work but you have to be 25 to 40 years old to keep you job. "
bad,"Compensation and Benefits are pretty good compared to most however there is really no room for advancement, no room for large raises based on merit and performance... only room for advancement, bonus, and good raises are for the ""good ol boy"" system."
bad,"I usually had nothing to do even though I was certified to work more programs than most people in the department. Management plays favorites. My manager was always inappropriate with language and attitude. If you have concerns with HR or Ethics, you get in trouble for asking and too many people get away with mischarging."
bad,NG has his integrity and is an honest company.  It is severely lacking in people engagement and talent management.  It's technical accomplishments are stunning (B2 bomber etc.)
bad,You are expected to work weekends and evenings. Management by intimidation. Highly stressed workforce. One of the worst employers I've ever worked for.
bad,"I was in an auto accident and suffered a Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). I was very lucky and recovered in half the time of the average. I returned to work, part time, in 6 months. The TBI information warned about discrimination upon returning to work and recommended having a workplace advocate. I didn't believe I needed one or had any concern as these were people I had worked with for over 10 years and considered friends. I was very wrong. Upon returning to work the situation started at being told I must still be brain damaged and proceeded over time to being told my memory was just fine and that I was just failing to perform. That was the diagnosis of the department manager. I ‘m not sure which part of his computer science degree or MBA qualified him to make judgment calls on brain injuries and recovery. But his ego has him convinced he is qualified for anyting and everything."
bad,"When I joined, this facility was at least 25 years out of date on current software processes. Software, although the largest group there, gets little respect and doesn't get to control their own projects. Project Mgmt runs everything and if it isn't being paid for by the customer, it doesn't get done. Software does not get to enact process improvements unless a customer agrees to pay for it... so it never happens."
bad,"Terrible NGC makes money hand over fist it's like they can print money . NGC took a 20 million Dollar loan from state of Maryland which they never have to pay back . Absolutely awful has been my experience my constitutional rights have been broken , but because Maryland is a work at will state there's nothing I can do against a giant like NGC it's shamefull . They have broken federal laws in my case and"
bad,"The job was described to me as an opportunity to learn about corporate life and the inner workings of a large company, as well as allowing me to make an impact in the environment there. Instead, I was given a large book to read, and then given two spreadsheets to ""clean up"" and write a small macro for. AND THIS WAS OVER A 5 MONTH PERIOD!! Definitely the worst experience I have had at a job."
bad,This company has the poorest management I have ever experienced. The low level lead had no experience in structural analysis and his immediate manager had been a contractor  for 30 years with no management experience.  Combined this caused a major failure of one their aerospace programs resulting in millions of dollars in rework.
bad,"In my technical field of engineering, there is not much advancement after you hit a principle position like manufacturing engineering. In the avionics lab I work in, I don't believe I am being challenged."
bad,"Maybe it was because I was a contractor and their #3 choice, or because my supervisor never believed I was a good fit.  Either way, it was an unpleasant place to work.  I recommend only accepting perm positions with this company.  Perm employees are less easy to discard.  They have a longer runway to be productive, and there is more ""buy in"" to their success."
bad,I work there for 35 years overall the pay was good but the where I worked I feel I was pick on so they fired me after 35 years of service I don't belive I should been fired
bad,They did mass hiring and placed me in an area I did not enjoy working. My managers switched every 3 months. Too many young people and not enough experienced workers.
bad,Only thing good about Huntington Ingalls is benefits and compensation. If you are not part of a buddy system or click you can forget advancement company is not an equal opportunity employer.
bad,"I enjoyed 4 years working with one team.  However, when moved to another team on the project it became a living nightmare.  The project lead micro manged the activities of the team."
bad,They brought me in and gave me 1 report to do and nothing else. 9 hours a day on 1 report. Laid me off a month later after I had already turned down 2 other job offers and an interview. Be careful when choosing this company over another as now I have heard they're known for laying people off. Very boring environment and manger was also rude.
bad,Awful work environment and corporate culture.  Nothing good about this company at all with the exception of the salary and benefits.  Save yourself some time and apply somewhere else
bad,"great team to work. Management is nice to work with."
bad,"If you can tolerate lies and denial for decent pay than this place is for you, if not don't even consider them.  "
bad,"The first day is a great picture that is painted to you , as your journey proceeds, you start to ask yourself what kind of koolaid did they give me, because the job culture is toxic , and that's why the big turnover , they claim attrition , but the truth is , they own you and if your new , the love hazing you , just like high school , worst toxic environment ever"
bad,"I took a job with Northrop based on several recommendations from friends that served in the military.  The company has a very good reputation on a national level and it might be a good place to work at a different location.  However, my experience was not a good one from the start.  I was told I would receive on day one 17 days of vacation  a year that I could bank for up to two and a half years and cash out when needed.  I was never told that I would actually have to accrue these days, which was approximately 11 hours a month.  After being at the company about a year I found out I was pregnant.  Trying to find out information regarding leave and Short term diability was a nightmare!! The local HR rep was useless, every question I asked her I was told to call the corporate HR hotline.  They were just as useless! I was given the run around for months regarding what i thought was a simple question, ""What exactley is my STD benefit, 100% pay for 6 weeks and 50% after that?"" "
bad,This was Grumman's first attempt to enter the NOCC arena and it had a bunch of trouble. They bid 500 million for a contract and went well over budget. The talent acquired was more from who knew who rather than who knew what and unfortunately they did not meet DOITT's standards on many aspects.
bad,"In a company like Northrop Grumman, you get to wear many hats, some at the corporate level and some at the program level. There was always a constant learning environment, tight deadlines, and lots of excitement. Top notch and hard working personnel all around."
bad,I saw security people violate security policies. HR NEVER does their jobs. I was assaulted by a supervisor and told to not report it by another person in management. Everyone is hired via nepotism and management is chosen in a similar fashion. Internal investigations are an incompetent joke. Discrimination and racism are normalized. They screwed up my security clearance. They literally nag low level people about timecard fraud while people with seniority spend all day on Facebook in the same cubefarm. Selective policy enforcement is the norm. Theft is a regular occurrence.
bad,Bottom line I think they suck as an organization as a whole..  They out source their services and do not have close interpersonal relationships with their employees.  This is a very disconnected company.
bad,"No career advancement. You're promised a position and screw you on it. Management harasses you all different kinds of ways, nothing was done about it even though several meeting were held. Promise of work for years but here I am laid off. Level 4 critiques you're work and make you feel so defeated because nothing is ever perfect. Manager doesnt know how to keep work steady. He rushed to get things through every week and ran us right out of work. They fired a girl who went into labor early. Tells how much this company really cares about you. Save yourself the stress dont work here. The work itself was awesome but not worth it to deal with this place."
bad,"After 20+ years with company, they do not hire or promote the people that deserve the credit they earned.  Many that do not work or just go day by day expecting to do nothing seem to get bonuses, promotions and job title increases"
bad,"This is a company made up of people with no motivation, no desire to improve themselves, no intellectual challenging work, and incompetent management."
bad,"The benefits are good, but the management is terrible.  I did not have the best experiences because I was not considered at favorite by management.  I cleaned up after the favorites."
bad,"Be told you will be working with whatever set of technologies that will get you to join. Then work with dead languages instead. "
bad,"I would not recommend this company to anyone seeking job satisfaction or promotion opportunities. In addition, the salary is not very competitive. Leadership fails to reach out to the common worker."
bad,"My time here has been awful. There is terrible training and a lack of mentorship. I do not have the tools to do my job yet I’m constantly getting more and more work thrown at me. It’s a complete mess and we are putting out one fire after the next.  I’m told it’s only my location that’s bad, so I will give the company the benefit of the doubt and say it’s only San Diego, CA."
bad,Learn the job and take advantage of the job detail to engage in growth to move foraward to further your career or job placement and must have tough skin .
bad,"DO NOT WORK HERE!!!!"
bad,"Dead end job unless you have a family member working there, your under paid, people placed in"
bad,Way too many layoffs for a decent career development. Benefits are extremely good but not worth the aggravation of losing employment.
bad,We have managers who are in positions and do not know what they are doing.  They have no leadership skills and no knowledge about what their employees do.
bad,"I took a pay cut to join Northrop Grumman thinking it would advance my career and provide job security if sequestration took a bite out of jobs in the area I work in.  I was told that although not 100% secure, the job was fairly secure.  They put a lot of pressure on me to follow a strict timetable to decide to accept their job offer.  Human resources was extremely haphazard with describing how my benefits would work.  "
bad,I worked for this company for about 3 years. I went to Iraq on a year assignment as a Program Manager. Came home and had no job!
bad,"Everyone at Northrop has perfect job security (they won't fire someone unless they mess up really bad).  As a result, everyone slowly realized that they didn't have to do their job well since there is no risk to their career and no additional reward for going above and beyond.  This is not a good employer for active-thinkers or people who like to improvise.  Creativity and challenging the status quo are discouraged, though not openly.  Perfect place for someone who's at the end of their career and just needs some healthcare for a bit."
bad,"There were people treated unfair and talked about in very disturbing manners by the Functional Manager, senior mentors, and other management. I have never seen anything like this in what's SUPPOSED TO BE A PROFESSIONAL company."
bad,"Advancement is not achievable within my work group, as there is no mentorship available.  Everyone I work with are within ten years years of retirement age, so do not want to grow in their careers, nor seek to train anyone to achieve solid career goals."
bad,The company seems very unorganized. I just started working with them and I do not know who is my boss and who to contact if I have any issues. Would not recommend this company to anyone.
bad,"I was a contractor at Lebanon, VA! ESS division! It was great working for the company but you could only get hired if you sucked up to the team leads! If you take more than 3 days off  in a year you are gone! And if you are a Vet and try to go to the Doctor you are gone!"
bad,Work is fun but challenging at times due to the condition of the area we're working in. You have to enjoy what you do to give it your best.
bad,"Sr management treats employees as expendable resources to be used up and discarded rather than as assets. They embrace the mindset that beatingsshould continue until morale improves."
bad,Workers come in late. They stay in aux while we were in que to purposely hurt our SLA. Management did nothing. Agents called customers dumb and worthless.
bad,the superviser is mean picky always find ways to put employs down and over all bad workplace is alright. with the guys and thats alright. but if they dont like you they will be on you for speak for yourself
bad,the workflow runs hot and cold. The cost of living is very high at the location. no one is in charge but no one seems to care. If you are over 50 this place is not for you.
bad,Northrop Grumman is overall a good company to work for with decent benefits and a great workplace culture. The employees work together to get the job done.
bad,Enjoyed my time working here but standard corporate environment and i witnessed some coworkers not treating other ones appropriately. A lot of talking over others - not listening to others - and a bully environment. Managers seemed to not care. Some managers are constantly absent actually. Weird environment.
bad,"I was a ""valued employee"" for about 4 years, the division I was employed with was spun off and then Obama instituted the Budget Sequestration.  Northrop does not care about you as an individual at all... avoid working for them.  About the only good thing is I get some dollars as a pension in six months."
bad,"I work 50-60 hours a week often 7 days a week. My Supervisor does not comprehend that this much time at work isn't good for my home life, or he doesn't care. The pay is good, but raises are non-existent. Too many co-workers are topped out on the pay, so those of us who haven't been with the company for 20+ years have little chance of a raise or promotion due to the rules of the company. My husband is basically single since I'm at work so much. Unless you're an Engineer or Management, you don't matter and neither do your needs. I used to recommend this place as a good job. Now, unless every other business on Earth has disappeared, do yourself the favor of working somewhere else."
bad,The best part about Northrop is the work/life balance. But it is government work so it is slow and no fun at all. Advancement is pretty tough as well.
bad,"I have never worked on a team or for a company with such a silo-based mentality.  I have been waiting for over two years for some kind of direction, guidance or training from my supervisor that I could use in supporting the contract I for which I was hired.  I've been told in every yearly review that my co-worker was directed to train me and bring me up to speed on our product. I'm still waiting for that training, meanwhile my co-worker does everything."
bad,This was a good laid back job for people who were able to listen to the issues of Military service members and their families about health care concerns.
bad,"Poor and unsatisfactory working environment. Has a lot to do with upper Management shadiness and favoritism... For example, One person in Management hires a neighbors' daughter over someone that's more skilled and highly qualified."
bad,1  This company is all about profits.  It cares nothing about people.  And NG deceives the federal government as much as possible.  NG lies and deceives as much as possible on testing of government systems.  NG is a nasty company.
bad,The rules are not the same for all employees. Managers are not good at what they do when it comes to a productive work environment.
bad,"This company has been dealing with funding shortages for over a year now. The environment is not stable, the morale is awful, the employees walk on eggshells and are all afraid for their jobs. On top of that, management is just shy of incompetent 9 times out of 10 - everyone is too busy watching thier own hides to watch out for the people for they are supposed to be managing. The Oxnard office has laid off so many people it's a joke. Apply here at your own risk."
bad,The various job positions that I held allowed me the opportunity to interact with numerous staff individuals and other departments on a daily basis. All jobs had to be coordinated and accomplished in a timely manner. Managers and staff met regularily to review work schedule deadlines and task progression. My jobs were service and support orientated with challenges that mostly had to be resolved daily. To serve these positions and to accomplish the job successfully gave me great pride.
bad,"NGC Sunnyvale is going through a hostile take over from NGC Baltimore - attrition layoffs / firings. 70% of the buildings are empty with 100's of empty desks. The management from Baltimore back stabs subordinates and everyone is running for the exits / sleeping on the job. Due to underfunding by the prime customer- The site is falling apart and if you would like to to get poor health coverage, be exposed to pregnancy ending chemicals, ran over by a golf cart carrying explosives, and have the celling fall on you this is the place for you."
bad,"really close to home, the facility is located in fountain valley.  The owner is really nice. this is just a temporary place for employment, very small business."
bad,As a contractor work enviroment is not very pleasant. But pay is okay
bad,"Managements ideals changed, the employee was no longer the focus, employees became expendable, experience no longer matters to get promoted, who you know and who you appease does."
bad,This small campus of Northrop Grumman is not a place to pursue employment unless you are related to someone who is employed there already. Promotions and career options are only open to those who are in favor of the management and this a stale environment.
bad,"The position acquired did not necessarily fullfull my qualifications and interests."
bad,"The culture there is almost hostile to contractors. They promised temp to hire in about 8 months and after 2 and a half years as a contrator, I left. One manager said I was one of the top contractors on thelist of those to be hired list, but my lead who told me almost daily that I was lucky to even have a job (passive aggressice). Also... Worked for the worst former Marine I have ever encountered."
bad,"the job itself is not hard. it is quiet interesting, but management is a joke! they treat their employees horrible. if you don't clique up with the right people, you're out of a job."
bad,"I interviewed for this position via phone and was offered the job at said amount. I was getting out of the military on the west coast and I drove to Warner Robins, GA to work for Northrop-Grumman. Upon the interviewing manager meeting me he instantly offered a substantial less amount than was agreed on the phone interview. What was I to do? Go back to California. P.S. I do not sound like I am african-american."
bad,They do not care about equal opportunity nor ethics. They completely dismiss issues brought to  managements attention. If you do say something there will be repercussions from some managers..
bad,"I was hired on as an engineer, but after a few weeks I realized no engineers work at this location.  The staff consists more of supplier managers and system integrators that are technically incompetent.  There’s no real design work at this location and management is extremely poor and has no interest training their people with the proper engineering tools or keeping them in tune to current technologies.  This was an unfortunate career move."
bad,"Of course, there's always *something* good to say, but what's so great about a place populated with narcissists, cliques, shunning, backstabbing, rudeness, bullying, hate, inter-sector animosity, lower-than-average pay, almost non-existent raises, never getting credit for your work, no chance for advancement, only the *golden* get bonuses, unjustified condemnation, lies, and the constant fear that the work is going to run out and you won't have a job. I'm sure I left out something--did I mention sociopaths?"
bad,"If  you are a woman or a minority Northrop is not the company for you.  There are some really fine hard working individuals at Northrop along with some really great managers.  Unfortunately I did not for them."
bad,"Northrop Grumman is not divers or supportive of those that differ in thought. I found it very difficult to work in an environment where everyone was very similar or related, the few minority co-workers I knew did not last long and I could not blame them. The pay was not based on ability or experience, someone just out of college could make more than someone with 10+ years of experience and advancement was typically seen in Military personal or relatives only"
bad,"NG used to be a place where you could build a career.  It has made a lot of changes over the past 5-7 years, none of which has been positive for employees.  The company has severely cut back on compensation and benefits.  Executives blame the recession and reduced government spending for these actions, but meanwhile the company is turning out record profits and the stock price has doubled.  If you are an engineer, this is probably still a decent company to work for.  But if you are any sort of support function (HR, Security, Accounting, Facilities, etc) it is a death trap.  Support functions (i.e. indirect) have been cut to the bone, with no relief in sight.  For such a large company, there is a severe lack of development and training programs."
bad,management doesn't care about employees. Only concern is bottom line to shareholders.
bad,"I worked at several offices in Rancho Bernardo. When I started, there was little direction, chaos. I had successfully saw a project through to completion that had failed 4 times before me and the government loved and gave follow on money. Yet, people who had nothing to do with the project came out of the woodwork taking credit for the software that had nothing to do with it, people who were responsible for the chaos in the first place."
bad,"The good ol' boy system is alive and well at NG, especially if you live in the Southern US. Their goal? to perpetuate the USA's global empire by any means necessary."
bad,Stillwater National Bank has one goal in mind which is line the pockets of the management.
bad,"It is a very stressful exhausting atmosphere. There are tremendous stresses and strains on you as a professional. Please prepare yourself for the male dominated, heavily military culture. It is debilitating and can be depressing,"
bad,Management has no clue and not paying attention to who is working and people who are sleeping everyday. No flow of work standing around for 9 hours a day for weeks then on overtime.
bad,They expected employees to work with limited tranning and had high expectations of employees. the tanning was horrible and they hired you in only as ammunition packer and told you the even you were qualified for a technician or maintenance position that you had to come in at the packer level. You were treated like you were in high school and not allowed to make suggestions ok given the opportunity to prove yourself. The packing department had a inexperienced supervisor who have favorites who would tattle on other employees and also were related to them.
bad,"Northrop talks about growth for its employees, but I personally have yet to see any of this opportunity. SO either it does not exist or it does not exist for specific individuals"
bad,The work environment at the Magna location of Northrop Grumman was not all that pleasant.  I felt like I wasn't able to questions or make observations. This made it hard for me to do my job to the fullest of my potential.
bad,"This environment given the push pull struggle between the state and Northrop Grumman was very contentious at times."
bad,"Great commute, 9/80 scheduled is a good idea, be prepared for political games, fake environment especially for newbies. Policies and procedures are set, easy to navigate."
bad,"I left because all UNIX SA were moved into the IT organization, GSSC at the time, and had to accept a pay cut to stay. I did not accept the pay cut. This is all I have to say."
bad,If you are a Contractor be very careful what you choose.  We were supposed to work until the end of 2018 but were abruptly laid off with only two days notice.  Very unprofessional management and treatment of Contractors.
bad,"You sit at your desk and work, then go to lunch, and back to your desk to work until it's time to go home.  It is frown upon if you talk to your co-workers."
bad,"Northrop runs a constantly understaffed help desk that will soon be non-existent. Its been reported that Northrop and Virginia have been in the disentanglement process and will split. As a contractor, the pay was good. If you want something longer than a few months then look elsewhere."
bad,"Management is out of control and violates government laws and their own company policies.  They think they are protected from their behavior and when someone is targeted by them, the rest of the group bands together because they are afraid of being the next target."
bad,The benefits are great. However management is not good. Promote people without any knowledge about systems. Coworkers yell at you and management will say those are leadership skills. No advancement opportunities. Low raises. Or shall we say lack of raises rewards.
bad,Poor management and supervision. promises were made which were not delivered. Northrop Grumman has a rich history but yet to establish itself in the UK hence the poor management.
bad,"After working at NGC for over 18 months, with 17+ years of professional experience, I feel this company has so much potential, yet does not allow it's employees to succeed. "
bad,Not any opportunity for growth and promotion. Near impossible career advancement. Specialty positions are contingent on contract awards which are not too many.
bad,The company gave the management the tools to make the workers happy. The management worked hard to make everyone unhappy. The only people who got ahead are the friends and family members of the management.
bad,It's has been an experience for me the entire time there. I'm glad to have the opportunity of working there.  
bad,"Saw people being laidoff but the company didn't offer any help in finding jobs. Unless other sectors, they try everything to help these poor displaced folks to land a job. We've just laid off a lot of senior people with senior positions and the average age is over 55. Management here is cold and incompetent and the environment is worst than a mon & pop shop."
bad,Have to use data from two separate systems to compile one simple report.
bad,"The pay is at market rate for the position however, there is little support to advance one's career within this company.  Training opportunities and advancement are limited."
bad,"Not for the faint of heart. If you are the type to get offended easily, this is not the place for you. Very high demands here with little room for error. A lot of bad attitudes at this place, especially from program management and executive management."
bad,Top Rated Trainer for 17 years per TSA/DHS/Evaluation 57 Line Item -Did contract training for TSA/DHS-Developed training programs-Developed Images for each local airport no mater size-Traveled 85% of the time!
bad,"There was always work to be done here, the only problem with this company is the lack of communication between technicians and supervisors. Many techs are afraid to approach the supervisor. Work is demanding, if you work 10 hrs you have to bring 8 hrs of work back. Micromanaging is also big for this place."
bad,GSC is the worst place to work for this company. Buyers are treated like bottom feeders. Come in upper level or go to another business area. I came in in 2016 at entry level and have been dealing with pure in professionalism since.
bad,"It was a daunting task to go to work, with the understanding that I was not going to be promoted, while at Northrop I achieved my Masters degree, head of the Latino organization, coached my son and was an assistant head coach, all as a single parent."
bad,"While you interview, make sure your prospective boss is someone who will be supportive and fair if you get hired there. "
bad,"Northrop is company that has focus upon good intentions.   This is a  solid foundation for great opportunities.  However,  one who travels knows that it is not uncommon for something to be ""lost in translation"".   As a consequence, the (end) result can often be out-of-phase with the (conceived) idea.  ""Translation"" is perhaps the act which most bothers the company in my perspective."
bad,"This job was a great starting position into the service desk world. But the management team was heavily soaked in a high school-like, drama filled mind set"
bad,"Tough management to work for always changes and never consistently given feedback. You never know who is coming or going, they promote unqualified people and try and justify, they do not do a good job with performance management."
bad,"I love the work I did for the company. But everyone there are siblings so it makes it rough for advancing especially when someone is related to a manager. Also I was a contractor and I was assigned to train someone , trained then when trained they let me go cause it was cheaper to not hire me on."
bad,Morning roll call followed by checking mechanics work assignment status. calling in Bldg repair orders or inspecting tool room  and tool box inventories.
bad,"Manager was not willing to teach, instead had favorites and people she didn't like she got rid of.  Was not a personal person, very demanding, workplace culture was very bad"
bad,The company prides it else on having a management base that is extreamly horizontal. This causes employees to be in conflict with multiple managers and vice presidential directions.
bad,From a lower level management position having been with company  things have gotten worse with losing people after training them to do hands on work on product they always leave for better pay because the bottom line calls for lesser skilled lower payed mechanics . This hurts morale as you are always answering for blown budgets and extreme rework and scrap parts . Overall it is great place to be an engineer but all aspects of production and management are too stressful for the pay .insurance Benifits have dwindled considering out of pocket expenses has tripled over last 3 years .
bad,"The pay scale is low and layoffs are a part of culture there.  If you take a job here, don't expect longevity.  The production manager's leadership style leaves a lot to be desired.  Seems to be okay with categorizing employees based upon gender."
bad,Limited opportunities. Hard to advance. Not an employee friendly company. Work culture can be a challenge. Interesting work assignment challenges.
bad,"Although, I support the mission and I believe NG's mission is one that's extremely hard to find, the management is a disaster, for this reason I can only give Northrop one star."
bad,"Extreme back biting environment driven by substandard Management and Leadership. Substandard Program Management, Contract execution, and Contract compliance. Should be reported to the GAO for manufacturing and fabricating price/cost analysis' for both prime contracts and subcontract compliance."
bad,"Working in this place , is rewarding in sense of helping your war fighters but the company that I was with, didn't know how to take care of their customer nor how to run the business.  The Management are there because it is politically correct not because of the ""value of performance""."
bad,A typical night was staying busy keeping to myself and doing my task at hand keeping a close eye on my work and making sure my work was completed to the fullest.
bad,"Northrop grumman offers perks, such as tuition reimbursement.  "
bad,"During my time at Northrop, I was seriously disappointed with the culture this company promotes. Being a major US defense contractor with multiple locations, I was expecting a highly professional atmosphere with competative compensation & benefits. What I was exposed to was a year of highly emotional management heavily pressuring employees in an industry which requires exceptional quality standards. It was not a pleasant experience at all. We were routinely asked to work upwards of 80 hours per week for little or no compensation. My co-workers would have been a great bunch of people to work with, if they weren't so stressed out all the time. The hardest part of the job was getting any time to spend with family. The only enjoyable part of the job was the sense of patriotism and accomplishment gained from working a defense contract on military aircraft. At the very least, we were supporting our men & women in uniform."
bad,Northrup is a great company with great people to work with. I enjoyed the many years I worked there. I also feel great that I was able to participate in the help of providing for our military in any help I could for their safety and tools to do their job
bad,I am contractor there. Seems to be a good amount of distrust of the supervision and management. Hours are not consistent. They are hiring more direct employees that are not qualified to handle the task that are required to accomplish difficulty task. Training is done by the contract employees.
bad,"As defense dollars dried up the company set about reducing its workforce. Quality people were drivenout and unqualified people were brought in at a reduced salary. There is absolutely no loyalty to faithful employees who consistently exceed the standards set by the customer. It became a ruthless, backstabbing environment. A very hostile place to work."
bad,"TDD Contracts Manager serious micro manager, very competitive, insecure' co-workers are insincere; cliquish; hardest part of job is getting ahead or proving oneself; best part is satisfied PMs and gov clients."
bad,"Separate location from teams and application teams I supported, made it difficult to work. Co-workers were great to work with."
bad,See summary above. The added cost of dealing with N.G. cost us numerous contracts which ultimately lead to company wide layoffs.
bad,"I think ""fun"" would be the last word to describe the office culture of NGC. It's very conservative and formal.  Old school perspectives and traditional ways of thinking are prominent."
bad,"Giant bureaucracy, both the company and the customer (DoD).  My project tried to do up to date work, most don't.  Plenty of people satisfied to fill a seat and get a paycheck."
bad,"It's a great company if all you are only interesting is a good salary, benefits, and working up the ladder for advancement. Not much professional integrity amongst long-term staff, low moral, poor quality middle-management and upper management, long hours, you put in the time and you're treated the same as the employee who does a minimal amount of work. Advancement is determined by relationships rather than productivity and quality work, however, advancement is simple as long as you are a 'yes man'."
bad,"The workload continues to increase, with no recognition nor additional compensation. Management plays favorites, and targets individuals for no apparent reason."
bad,"Dictated too from the US headquarters with very little joint up thinking."
bad,I believe the production floor should have a union in place to help support the factory workers. The work environment did not have a well scheduled pace and as a result caused poorly distributed hours. The management had huge demands and did not manage production time well. In addition there is poor training techniques to help ensure quality products. The management does not treat everyone fairly. The work life balance is poor respected. The immediate supervisors force last minute long hours and mandatory overtime regularly.
bad,"Internal and customer meetings consume 1/3 or more of each day, with a strong focus on process compliance and checking off items on a policy list regardless of schedule or personnel impact."
bad,"There is a lot of nepotism and if you are not related to someone, you don't have much chance of getting ahead.  There are few opportunities and for the ones that do come along, there is pressure to give ""exposure"" to those who they are trying to promote.  "
bad,Good for recent college grads.  Too many senior management changes in 24 months.  No change.  More work fewer people.  Most of your colleagues are great to work with.  That is the most enjoyable aspect.
bad,"Job war ok, Arbeitsklima oft gedrückt, da immer die Auftragslage der Firma im ""Raume"" stand, d.h. es war von Anfang an mit Kündigungen zu rechnen, was sich auch später bewahrheitete. Nicht nur bei meiner Person, sondern auch bei vielen anderen Mitarbeitern"
bad,"I have not had but two good managers at Northrop Grumman.  The company still struggles with diversity and inclusion issues which I am sure the problem with most major corporations."
bad,"Took a position in Annapolis by the water maybe I was more excited about the view of the bay bridge than the job.  Low morale, poor management, good ole boys club, with minimal room to grow and long hours."
bad,I worked as a machinist at northrup grumman.  This was a new job for me.  I gained experienced as a machinist working on a carrier.  I enjoyed my time at northrup grumman.
bad,There is no balance between work and time-off.  They will work you to death if you let them.  No recognition for a job well done.  They will work you to death until something is finished and then give you more work without so much as a 'Good job'.
bad,"I know things might be hard, but before you decide to work here look into going to school for an education. I'm currently attending an online college and dont seem to have enough time still. As well as they like to change hours frequently on you on short notice."
bad,"Northrop Grumman cares about one thing profits to their shareholders.   Don’t give me wrong it is a good company with lots of room for mobility but before taking a job there it is important to understand that you are not a priority to them.   They do not care much for their employees work life balance or time with their families .  It is common practice for managers to expect employees to work at minimum 5 to 10 hours of unpaid overtime weekly if you were working on a program and if you are Work for One of the functional homerooms you are expected to  work at minimum the job of three people by yourself.  "
bad,The Site is small.  Not much opportunity.  If you do work at the site plan on moving if you want to get promoted.  Good Company just a poor small site
bad,"Although I really enjoyed the work and the program, I felt that there was really no room to advance past my existing role. I felt that the diversity opportunities were extremely limited once the Director level was approached. I felt that after many years of service that I had proved myself over and over again, but I could never break thru to the next level. I think that if the culture does not change that Northrop will just become a training ground for other companies."
bad,"sexist work environment (not surprising in aerospace where it's primarily old white men)."
bad,"The company is setup for a failure.  The culture is very toxic and non-supportive.  Management style is outdated and people in managerial role are in the position due to the connections not for their caliber. Managers have ZERO interpersonal skills.  Please do yourself a favor and find another employer to work for.  The company may offer higher pay than other employers, but please do not fall for it."
bad,"Started out great, thought I'd retire with them, but after 8 years I've had enough.  There is no room for advancement, bonuses are super low, and they try to hold any pay that you do get over your head, like an abusive spouse. ( you're not going to get this anywhere else)."
bad,You are employed until contract with the customer ends. Then you have to go. Not much different from working as contractor. At the end of the contract term - always feel unsafe.
bad,"The manager's had no idea about any of the actual work that was going on. Whenever you asked for help, you didn't get it. The hours were excessively long, the work environment was sub-par and at times unsafe. The workplace culture was very cutthroat and every man for himself. People would come behind you and mess up work you did or take credit for your work and show the manager their messed up work and blame it on you."
bad,"Northrop Grumman offers good job security, however, the company's leadership makes very poor decisions and it affects how happy the employees are. Hard to make advancements in career without moving around."
bad,it was ok but very stressful as the management was lazy and did not want to assist in makeing job smoothe aand did not do there job to make your work easier.
bad,The environment I was in was not professional.  The management was dysfunctional and had personal agendas rather than lead for the team.  Personnel was not qualified to be in managerial positions.
bad,Job satisfaction.  Difficult with the new rapid growth.  Becoming cutthroat with the new contract wins and rapid growth.  Going from 2500 employees at this location to over 7000.
bad,"The security check are crazy, walk miles every night . better managers are needed to monitor the guards and facility.  pay was ok not great for the area"
bad,"Had fun deploying, worked with some really good team members, has good benefits (in the dept I worked in at least)on the Flip-side it has inept management and really awful team members. best to keep one eye on your job and the other on your back."
bad,"A typical day at work was stressful."
bad,Not a great company for work life balance.  Pay is good depending on the department.  Moving up is hard depending on the department.  Some perks and benefits are worth it if you need them.
bad,"the same as I had said before. The corporation seems to be organized, but the project and program management team did not understand that they need to please the client who was DHS."
bad,"It is interesting, to say the least, how some of the managers at this company got to where they are. It's a good ol' boy system and if you know the right people and can talk sports and hot air, you've got a chance at promotion. But, if you do the right thing, know your job well and try to help others, you just might find your clearance being threatened because the manager is intimidated by you. Then, instead of Human Resources removing the manager(s) that cause the problems, they take dedicated and hard working employees and move them to places where they'll either be miserable and quit, or to a proposal which may not be won, so they can ""justifiably"" be laid off in the future."
bad,Horrible working conditions. Get cursed out everyday by mgmt. treated workers like second class citizens. would go from 10 days to 12 hour days with no warning or advance notice.
bad,I enjoyed working for Northrop Grumman. New opportunities were available throughout my 9.5 years tenure. Worked multiple programs.
bad,"The job serves its purpose, provides many with an opportunity to work. The atmosphere has dwindled in recent years and culture has as well. Be careful of the sector you join, they are not all equal."
bad,"The day begins with walking through the decaying, 100 year old buildings.  I've avoided slums that look better.  Electrical cables line the walls.  On rainy days, there are bubbles in the rain puddles from the leaking gas and air pipes.  The pavement is so cracked, a fellow worker broke both of her arms just walking to work.  The place hasn't been properly maintained since about 1990.  It does not comply with the ADA act, so there are no elevators anywhere."
bad,"High stress & pressure; diminishing benefits; contract didn't allow vesting benefits, poor severance program."
bad,"After have been working there for more then 2 years, I won't want to be back. Due to unfriendly work environments, some other thing that I can mentions."
bad,"The people I worked with were hard working, dedicated, knowledgeable individuals. Unfortunately, senior management did nothing but lie to the employees, and ultimately stole the contracts that were won for the long island population and moved them to San Diego, and Melbourne. My happiest day was when they laid me off, and relieved me of the daily tension that we all lived with for years. They say there is life after NGC, and I hope to be able to find it."
bad,"But the company as overall suck. The management team don't know jack about managing peoples, they will go all out to protect themself and don't hesitated to throw you under the bus, if needed be."
bad,"Primary clients were Navy/DOD accounts"
bad,"When politics come into play, which in-turn hinders productivity."
bad,the title says it all. poor management. an abusive and unsafe working environment.
bad,"The company boasts of well trained and knowledgable security while everything is based on seniority rather than merrit. most personnel were over weight, one needed a cane to get around. Management was too busy trying to make you think they were ""high speed"" to notice anything going on around them."
bad,"It was a trying experience. I appreciate them for giving me a chance, but contract work is not fair. Hiring people and then letting them go when the contract is up is not right at all."
bad,"Northrop Grumman is a huge company and as a result has different cultures all over the world, in all it''s various cubbyholes. If you have a position with one of the technically focused, integrated and functional divisions, I suspect it will be a great job. I did not -- and it was a very rough and miserable 3.5 years. The division made a conscious decision to back the local project manager despite evidence to the contrary because the customer ""loved""him. Ethically challenged, reactionary, and secretive it made my job impossible. One of the folks at the Division HQ told me after I was encouraged to resign because they wanted to go a different way, ""It was a thankless position and utterly unfair. This is better for you."" I agree...I rarely have to deal with sociopaths and paranoids anymore."
bad,"The training absolutely SUCKS. They need to have their trainers attend classes on ""How to train"". The senior employees keep a lot of the tools needed to do the job in their tool box so it's hard to perform day to day work duties.I had a senior employees be horribly rude!"
bad,"I was in the process of being laid off because the government contract was expiring. I had 3 follow on interviews with a different division within the company. The only thing that held me from receiving the position was that my security clearance was not within a 6 year period from issue. I was more than qualified for each position, but because my ACTIVE clearance was not within the 6 year window, I was disqualified from each position."
bad,"This company laid me off one and a half days after my father died, over the phone. Management is terrible. All men in management.  Its actually CEO in St. Charles. Owned by Northrop.  If the Northrop knew how this company was ran, they would have shut it down years ago."
bad,"Corporate and Enterprise Services create too much additional and excessive processes. The people in the corporate and enterprise services know they aren't going anywhere because the holding company mentality. They will sell off divisions that don't perform, but the inefficient performance of corporate and enterprise services is clearly not measured. Too much overhead."
bad,Not a faced paced environment or very challenging. Work here if you have a family and are not looking to advance professionally. Wages are low compared to competitors and they charge the government a premium.
bad,"When I initially found out I was going to be working at NG I was ecstatic. I shortly there after realized that it was not what I had been expecting. From the day I was put on the floor I felt targeted. I was harassed by HR for everything from my Facebook down to pants I was wearing at the credit union  on my day off. I was eventually laid off for putting sunglasses on in the hanger before stepping out side on my break. I wrote a letter to the head of HR a detailed timeline of events explaining how it seemed to myself and many others that I had been bullied and wanted an explination. I was told “we have done worse for less”. Even my father, the Director of Maintenance and Operations was unsuccessful at receiving a reason. I am very disappointed in how things are actually run at Northrop Grumman."
bad,"My points were getting close because I had nothing but bad luck since I started there. However, when it came to excused absence it should've been when I went to the hospital on the clock. This was unexcused by them and they let me go. This is what a lot of companies have been doing and it makes me sick. No wonder the unemployment rate is where its at. Hold corporations to higher standards America!"
bad,"I worked at Northrop for over 10 years.  During that time I have watched great people and managers run away from this company.  On paper this place should be great.  Fantastic pay and benefits, company is winning new business constantly.  The problem is with the leadership and the people.  The company can’t drag themselves out of their old school government mentality and so only the low performer / lifers remain.  Everyone else goes on to work for better companies that take more of an interest in the growth and success of the company AND their people.  So the culture is very focused on not rocking the boat, keeping your head down, and hoping you can retire.  The company has no values, no heart, and they can’t plan / strategize their way out of a paper bag but they will spend 15-hour days talking about it."
bad,Certain Sectors are great to work for but others have frequent reorganizations and job security is up in the air. Communication is lacking but they do offer good benefits.
bad,"They will hire you in on a relocation package and sign on bonus, and then give you job responsibilities that are much different than what you agreed to at offer acceptance. You're stuck there for a year or else have to pay back your relocation and bonus. Put simply, management doesn't care about what you want out of the job, they will use you as they see fit, whether you like it or not."
bad,"Nice people but company is behind the times when it comes to CAD and related computer programs & systems. CAD position is primarily data entry and management of data. Primary CAD duties are ""packaging"", not mechanical design & documentation. BOM are not associated to SolidWorks but rather a separate manually entered process. Wire Lists are strictly manual and o not relate to any electrical or mechanical package."
bad,I worked overseas for Northrop Grumman for 18 months and every month something changed out of the blue. We were never briefed of upcoming changes until they had to be mad forcing us to scramble and rush for completion. Leadership NEVER addressed our concerns for the changes or showed us in writing why the changes had to happen. The worst part about it all was that your money was always messed up and it took the company way to long to correct pay issues!
bad,"I haven't worked at many corporations, but I can tell you that this one is not run professionally at all.  People speak rude to each other in meetings and they walk out or make 'scenes'.  It's worse than the worse reality shows.  I stay there because I need my job and they pay relatively well for the area that I live in.  Also, I am a single mother and the flexibility in working hours is a huge plus."
bad,"Worked at NGC for 6 years as a ""grunt"" design engineer.  No opportunity to advance, just keep pushing designs/drawings out the door.  Same pay raise (1% to 3% year) as the next guy whether you do more than him/her or not.  If you have a PHD you may make it into management and make more $$$, but be prepared to get stepped on.  Very poor management. Typical corporation."
bad,"although they pay good, they hold it like a carrot in front of your face to treat you unfairly and take advantage of you. they still try to ride their old reputation of being a company for the workers and family first though it hasn't been like that for many years. if you need work have at it."
bad,"Northrop has constant layoffs and has been reducing health benefits, retirement benefits, vacation and holidays steadily year after year."
bad,"This is one of the most stingy companies in the country. They hate to pay their workers a competitive salary, and hate promotions. The only people who get paid are managers. This company has  some major issues that don't seem to have an end in sight"
bad,we took pride in building one great ship at a time. The company took time to train employees and the management had great leadership and experience.
bad,Management needs more focus on employees.  Customer satisfaction is good however the company needs more career advancement for younger staff to maintain growth plans
bad,"The day to day work was challenging and rewarding. I learned a lot of office skills from the plethora of e-learning programs that were set up by corporate. The company also provided many other training and qualifying programs. They also provided good but expensive benefits (dental, health, life insurance, and many different retirement plans). I was not impressed with the management in this company or the HR department. They were secretive, incompetent, and seemed to turn a deaf ear to employee complaints. When the company decided to close down our branch, the employees heard about it on the local news rather than from upper management. They also did a wonderful job at keeping us guessing when the branch was going to officially close by changing the closure date many times, sometimes without informing the employees. Many of my co-workers, like management, were also incompetent and under-qualified for their positions. The hardest part of this job was dealing with them on a daily basis. The best part of the job was the decent pay and benefits."
bad,"When I first got hired the company was a great place. A fun atmosphere, great people, and room for advancement within the company. But every since then it has been declining drastically with poor decisions from upper management. In the past year we have gone through three layoffs and I bet there is more coming..."
bad,"Great compensation and benefits for the required skills and talent. If you don't mind halting your growth, you can probably carve a hole somewhere and leech from the company for the rest of your career."
bad,"This is one of the worst companies I have worked for. They function as a staff agumentation company. Although you are led to believe you are a Northrup employee and they care about your well-being, often time this is not true. My experience is within the Public Health sector which is not the primary sector for NG. Many of their manager are not effective in their roles. They are offer unattached to the work being done. The management typically only interact with the client when their is a problem. NG does not manage their work by SOW. They tend to just 'hand you over the client to do as they please'. Their is not a lot of direction as to what is required on you as a NG employee. Moral is very low and there is a great deal of backstabbing. Many of their atlanta public health contract (CDC) are being recompeted. They are losing a great number of contracts based on new HHS contract requirements. NG is not honest about the status of contract and tend to wait to the last minute and layoff their employees."
bad,"They hired many people but they did not have "
bad,There is a lack of comuncation between departments.  Upon my arrival no one knew I was supposed to start at that time. Then shortly after arriving on site over seas our DoD contract was canceled.
bad,"Interesting work, but the other companies just pay more with identical benefits and work.Very high turnover leads to either having very new engineers or very senior engineers, nothing in between."
bad,"Incoming inspection of military equipment including mechanical, electrical and optics."
bad,I am not pleased with them as they only promote people with degrees and only candidates with degrees get better salary. Previous military folks do not get any respect.
bad,"Nice to have 9/80 schedule, decent on-campus gym with small fee, and 401k match. Dental insurance and health insurance fee were lower with company support, but these hardly cover anything besides preventive care. Nice Employee Resource Group (ERG) events available."
bad,Culture is stuck in 1990s. Older engineers stuck in ways and resistant to change or ideas suggested by younger engineers. Not a fun place to work compared to modern day engineering companies.
bad,"Too much nepotism within salaried ranks that prohibit promotion to other levels. Family members are entrenched in jobs not qualified to perform, yet those qualified can not even get an interview."
bad,"Prior to 2001, I worked for an aviation navigation equipment company whose primary customers were the world's major airlines and major aircraft manufacturers.  In 2001, Northrop Grumman acquired the company I worked for as well as our sister company who specialized in military customers."
bad,Great compensation and benefits program. Falls short in new employee introduction and guidance. Poor internal opportunity visibility by the nature of the work leads to short falls in career advancement chances.
bad,"Intelligent and Impressive colleagues, but sub-standard management.  The management seemed disengaged with their employees and needed some leadership ability. The management seemed not to display genuine care for their employees on contracts."
bad,The company supports uppermanagement and neglects employees.  Regardless of the action of the management.  Not i terested on employyes need with lack of respect towards them.
bad,Challenging work environment with many varied focus areas.  Many employees from different backgrounds.  The company is working to build a global reputation.
bad,"I worked here for 9 years in a non-engineering role.  Both of my managers during this time were authoritarian; neither offered much room for advancement which is ultimately why I left the company.  Work/life balance was pretty good; some overtime and weekends necessary but nothing too outrageous.  This company is a very old boy culture where I often heard women mocked for achieving higher level management jobs and where some of the older engineers would still make comments about the actions and appearance of women.  The bureaucracy at NGC runs deep and for such a large company, there are SO many people who are employed there because their mom/dad/uncle/whatever also works/worked there.  Sector mergers have led to a decrease in supervisor, lead and lower level management positions so mobility is limited unless you are are engineer.  The final comment is that HR has been outsourced so getting into NGC now is a nightmare with resume key word searches and multiple screening interviews before you even speak with a hiring manager.  When I left after 9 years, I was given a checklist to complete and my manager never once offered guidance about off-boarding."
bad,Long stretch of not hiring new employees and when they did it was hard to transfer knowledge to new hires and felt like an outsider. Many employees liked to brag about how they worked there for 25+ years but did little to assist and offer guidance to new hires.
bad,did me wrong after I got hurt..Blackball me I was dedicated employee . never miss anytime . So nut left hose in middle of catwalk on the stair down to ship and I trip and got hurt.
bad,"nice place to work with great professionals wiling to help you in case of need, it was really nice to work there. good company, good people"
bad,I can say it is one of the safest place to work for during my time there and it was the most prejudice places that I work for.At first I thought it was me that I was doing something wrong but after five year I have a supervisor tell me that they (my boss at the time)he had try everything to get rid of me but couldn't because I was that good of a welder and that just one case
bad,NG does not advance people unless they are brought in straight out of college.  Raises are bad no matter how hard you work and the contributions made.
bad,"NG has one thing going and that is its policies and procedures.  Most things are very repetitive and regimented, which I prefer.  "
bad,"It is expected that you are available 24/7 for all situations.  It is common, and expected that you be available during vacation and during the holidays."
bad,"Located in New Orleans, LA on the MS River, I found Northrop Grumman not as secure job wise as I was told. I found that being in the shipyard is very hard and dangerous working culture."
bad,"Working for Northrop Grumman was interesting.  I was promised a certain annual salary and was shorted it by roughly $26,000.  I worked overseas and the salary was the main reason I took the job.  They never corrected any of my paychecks and I never received any back money I was owed.  If it wasn't for this, I would have given the company a higher rating as I did enjoy my job. "
bad,"Contract managers are not superior caliber. Very cavalier attitudes, need more on the job training on how to treat employees, lot of favoritism, knowledge and experience not a requirement, promotions based on who you know not what you know. Managers not flexible, lacking people skills, need to attend anger management classes, extremely difficult to work with. Cannot advance because of bias or jaded opinions. Great benefits, only managers and directors get more than 1.5% raises."
bad,"I have been very happy at Northrop Grumman. My typical day includes interviews with users and customers to discover what they are asking for, collaboration within the IPT to ensure we come up with good solutions, and verification of projects by other systems engineers. Additionally, I have been allowed to initiate process improvements; right now I am working on a prototype for assessing ""what"" the problem is, and what resources we have to solve the problem. My intent is to provide a complete story of the IPT assessment of the problem and how that assessment led to the defined requirements. I am able to maintain friendly relationships with most of my co-workers."
bad,Small location and was able to get to know most of the people in the office.
bad,Co-Workers are great. Management is very bad. You have to self teach yourself. Training is minimal at best. A typical day at work varies from being totally swamped to having little to do. Hardest part of the job is getting any information from Management as to where I stand or where the company is going.
bad,"Certain divisions are better than others. Know exactly what you are signing, and even then ask questions is you have them; big or small ASK. Its a very large company with many divisions that separate it into specific areas of expertise. It is also dependent upon the state of which the division falls under, you may be contracted out to work for another division within the company. But your primary division is what matters, and if that division is in another state then you are obligated to follow that specific states law and regulations; i.e. right to work states. Be careful what you sign and know that laws for that state."
bad,"This company has the worst management I have every seen. They treat the employees like sheep and the place is run like a prison. Although the compensation is decent, the trade-off is your soul! My suggestion - pass on NG if you want to work in a pleasant work environment."
bad,"Be careful when you report to a manager when you are out of his/her league (and those above him/her) in an area that is an important part of our work."
bad,I was hired as a contractor. Worked for 7+ months for around 50 hours a week. The pay was fantastic. There was few people that would let you know what was going on with the project and when I reached out to a co-worker he complained to me and my boss about texting him. Everything was working out great and we had plenty of staff but 3 people were hired that were much younger and they never called me back to work. Nothing was said to me and when I reached out about it and I got in trouble for contacting my supervisor. When I asked if I still worked there my staffing company said I had done nothing wrong.
bad,"Defense contractor."
bad,"I worked in the enterprise sourcing organization. They treat the employees terribly, they are overworked and do not get the recognition they deserve. If you join the company, you will have great job security because you are more than likely to be doing the work of 3+ people to start.   They very rarely let anyone go, but they will overload you until you are forced to quit.  Many of the new hires learn quickly and move on."
bad,"Unionized and compartmentalized.  Not a good place to learn or grow.  A very combative place where parties are very territorial (see unionized).  On most assignments I can grow and make inroads.  Here there were all sorts of barriers.  This seems to be a dinosaur company and a very inflexible one at that.  My manager was a good guy who was put in a bad spot and did his best to take care of us.  "
bad,"I learned all about tools and became an assembler 3. Loved working with hands, put together various motherboards, from navigational to CPU's for computers."
bad,"Northrop has a lot of things going for it, but I need something with more understanding management."
bad,"Direct management is fantastic. Upper management, not so much. Pay is mediocre, and opportunities are limited. If you want to make more, go to a competitor such as Boeing or Lockheed."
bad,"Management scared to take responsibility,make a decision.  Prone to blaming workers in the lower ranks than be accountable. There is no real management! Not sure what is your HR file!"
bad,"Many small issues have to be elevated to senior management to make a decision, which often takes weeks of internal arguing to resolve so nothing gets done. Too few people are actual decision makers but they try to force their opinion on designs even if the stakeholders disagree."
bad,"Very strict muslim country. However, there are oppotunties to get and have a good time. Working with the Saudis can be tricky. If want to keep your job never, talk about religion, or politics on the job no matter how friendly you think they are."
bad,It is a good job good safe work environment had fun thay tried to keep the job as ciean as possible one of the best job I have ever had would recommend working there
bad,"Bad place to work. Management is either hit or miss and when it's miss, it's bad. Management is extremely unprofessional: late, minimal communication and passive aggressive. Due to contract with Social Security Administration, culture is slow and ineffective. The work that you do is mostly busy work and hardly ever related to your current or desired workskills. Most folks in this location use it as a place to take classes and bide time before moving on. Pay is average."
bad,HR controls the whole company and management has no control over who gets raises or promotions.  HR makes that decision without knowing the employee or their work ethics.  The company emails you regularly about how much money they are making but pays employees the absolute minimum and has poor health benefits.
bad,Good place to get your foot in the door for government work. Technical services sector employees had 401K and retirement plans taken to save money.
bad,"In general, technical staffing and succession planning has been a huge issue on many established programs.  A rash of employees leaving the company and retirements over the past few years coupled with slow hiring rates has left many engineering skill set gaps and program headcount shortages across the board.  Retention rates have dropped among new hires.  Program management and functional front-line managers handle staffing very poorly and often ignore the problem until their EV spreadsheets and schedule milestones are deep in the red.  The headcount shortages often leave experienced engineers stretched very thin and projects perpetually behind schedule.  Program management also has a hard time understanding that complex tasks requiring unique skill sets cannot be filled with new hires or interns without significant training which is often not budgeted for.  Compounding this problem is that contract proposals are written without concern for staffing or skillset availability/development.  There is a noticeable lack of communication between program management from different functional areas until serious staffing conflicts arise."
bad,"The hours were great and the pay was amazing! However, the work is tedious and consuming. I loved the people I had to work with but the management was cocky, rude and disrespectful. I worked as a inside machinist apprentice and I loved it. Each day I would work on a project, read blue prints, layout work pieces and inspect my parts. There are so many moving parts when doing this type of work but it was fun."
bad,"There are no typical days for field engineers."
bad,"Mijn werkdag bestond uit het uitdraaien van orders. De producten verzamelen en verpakken en vervolgens klaar maken voor verzending. Ook het in-, en uitboeken van producten was mijn taak. De zelfstandigheid die ik daarbij had vond ik erg prettig. Ik was verantwoordelijk voor alle orders en nam die verantwoordelijkheid serieus. "
bad,I learned that I should of stayed with my previous employer even though the money was less and benefits cost more. The job was fairly easy but management tend to set people up and are unethical.
bad,NGC has the most potential possible of any other company that fits it’s same description.  Managment placed throughout will ruin anything good chance to optimize on that fact.
bad,Management and HR is HORRIBLE!!!!! Management lies and HR is extremely hard to reach. Company does not have employees back or care of thier concerns. I work 2nd shift I am extremely unhappy and it has put stress on my home life. I have went to HR and management and they did nothing to try to work with me.
bad,"I can only review IT."
bad,"Typical workdays include sedentary computer based work environments with limited opportunity for movement outside of attending meetings. The work is repetitive, and frequently halted by technical issues."
bad,It was unorganized and wasted a lot of navy and tax payer dollars. They offered little to now way of moving up in the position and only increased pay to meet the new employees coming in despite there lack of experience.
bad,"If you don't mind not having good leadership, the correct tools and serviceable tools than this is the job for you. Working here was probably the worst aviation company I've worked for"
bad,"Great benefits"
bad,The people are great. The benefits are decent. Management especially senior leadership is lacking. No clear promotion path given. Not a lot of feedback from direct managers either.
bad,"I was hired on directly out of college. I was excited for the opportunity to work for a company with such a great reputation. While going through the hiring process never once was I led to believe that possibly I would be out of a job within 8months. So I moved all the way to st louis and started working. There were many red flags that I started to notice. Eventually there was talking of a furlough . I was scared, I moved all the way here to have the company tell me I'm out of a job until ""I don't know when"". Thankfully I was smart enough to get a new job , and what do you know, my old work friends have been out of a job for over a month now, with no idea if/ when work will start again."
bad,"Nice people, boring job. Very repetitive work, but a good work life balance for people who like that sort of thing. Every other Friday off which is cool. Decent pay and benefits."
bad,"pros:"
bad,This company gave me a lot of good opportunities; which I did take advantage of.
bad,"Northrop Grumman is an older company, so with that comes a lot of paperwork, processes, red tape, and slow changes. On the other hand, management makes their best effort to provide lots of career opportunities for all employees."
bad,"The culture at Northrop is by far the biggest downside of the company. There are many employees that simply lack ambition. This definitely comes from the culture of moving people around and not firing anyone, even when there have been multiple HR complaints about a specific employee. There were many times when the few ambitious employees would have to do double the work to make up for under-performing employees. This does translate nicely for the work life balance at Northrop. No one will mind if you have to leave in the middle of the day. "
bad,I love the people I work with and the challenge of the work but decisions by upper management undermine our morale and sabotage our productivity. Managers above the functional manager level are out of touch with product team and industry best practices.
bad,They have provided me with a good job but not the career I am seeking. One of the biggest problems they have is management. There are way to many  supervisors and middle management that things get disconnected. There are also way to many inconsistencies from one supervisor to the next. One month you will be getting a raise for your supervisors and the next month they will have moved him to a different area and your new supervisor has you on probation. The office politics are also very bad here.
bad,I would never work for Northrop Grumman VSS again. The management/supervision  treat their employees poorly. The pay is decent and the benefits are good.
bad,"Management at the executive level moves too much, causing people below to chase changing objectives and have conflicting direction. Culture is ok overall."
bad,This is a new work environment for me. My experiences until now have been mostly in the small business sector. Working for a large corporation has been different. It can feel like you are just a number.
bad,"The company started of well when I first started. So well after my first contract I decided to come back. After layoff and management changes, the new staff were very unprofessional and lack dedication."
bad,"As a young creative engineer, NGC Bethpage had no growth opportunities, and rewarded poor management. Management couldn't get out of their own way to provide a quality product to the customer."
bad,"The location I worked at had a ""good ole boy"" mentality.  So many cliques.  Advancement and opportunities given to friends and not those deserving.  Management was clueless as to who performed the actual work and who was a valuable employee."
bad,"The biggest problem is they never get rid of the bad employees, the good news is if you are lazy, do nothing and are completely incompetent you never have to worry about being fired.  The bad news is if you know what you are doing and are a hard worker they will overload you so they have a constant turn around of good employees since they rather push them out the door than get rid of the bad ones and then they complain they cannot retain people and are short staffed."
bad,"My impression during my tenure was that a large portion of the work was being migrated from New York to Florida. After I was laid off from my NY job, the company relocated 850 employees from NY to Florida two months afterwards."
bad,A company that is stuck in it's old ways. Hard to promote in a good old boy environment. I do not intend to go back nor do I recommend this company. If you do decide to join this company insure that your are paid what you are worth.
bad,All Indian Company. Would have been good if I spoke Hindu as sometimes people spoke it during meetings. Company needs more diversity in my opinion.
bad,"Had the opportunity to work directly with the government, and visit military bases to interact directly with the military."
bad,I learned management techniques that Northrup Grumman utlizes in their company.
bad,Northrop Grumman is very disorganized and the management is hired on (the Good ol Boy) system. in other words they hire there friends to supervise workers not talented supervision
bad,A typical day at work consistd of from 8-12 hours repairing mig guns and issuing proper welding rods and other related materials. Learned to repair what many thought was not repairable. Co-workers were great. The hardest part of the job was correcting others mistakes. The most enjoyable part og the job was meeting deadlines
bad,Northrop Grumman Mission Systems has horrible employee services as they outsource many of their services and therefore a disconnect between employee and employer is very high.
bad,No recent employment history is available to validate a useful survey for current use. Employment history with Northrop Grumman Corporation as of 2012.
bad,"Right now the top managers want the stock to grow. They have no care for the workers, product, or advancement of the company. The only goal is to push out the product with a lower cost."
bad,NGNN (now Huntington Ingalls Newport News) provides lots of great opportunities and potential for advancement. The pay is typically low to average and they do not want to pay for experience. Work days are average and the environment depends the department and location.
good,"The work load is streesful.  I learned from there management talks good to your face and bad behind your back.  Management needs to improve a lot.  There are all types of people there with different backgrounds, different cultures and management needs to accept that, not everybody is going to be the same.  The most enjoyable part of working there is how different people are from one another. Employee's are great people.  Management thinks that because every one that works there they all should be the same.  Different people have different cultures and Management needs to understand not every one is the same."
good,The time I spent at this company was very rewarding for the rich business process guidelines that I acquired over the period of time that I was employed.
good,"I was let go from them because I had to serve on federal grand jury. Although their reason was lack of work but I was the only one let go, so it left a very sour taste in my mouth."
good,A typical day at NGSM is physically exhausting. The MSE is expected to forgo every other aspect of their lives personal and professional. In return the salary is reasonably high but the physical demands are such that once the MSE is worn out or injured there is no succession so they are tossed out as a defective unit to be replaced by another human who can be ground down and used up.
good,It's impossible to try to work your way up in this company and the unions make it so that the people who are the least qualified but have been there longer get promotions when there are better candidates. It's also impossible for the people who are incompetent to be fired.
good,"Pros: Awesome work and makes one proud to say that they build EOD robots for a living. 4, 10 hour days with Fri, Sat, and Sun off is the best kind of work week. Quite, clean, temperature controlled production floor with individual work benches and rolling toolboxes.  "
good,Many meetings but there are no resolutions. Programs are always slipping. No training for interns or new hires. Mentorship is something not realistic.
good,"This is more of a HELP Desk IT position which I was not qualified for.  I did not understand the language."
good,"They gave no raises. No increase in benefits. No promotions. No extra time off, just comp time, if you are lucky.  They came in and wanted to know all our business, then they left."
good,From Where I sit Northrop Grumman Fort Irwin is mismanaged and in need of an Army/Government review of all processes.
good,"Can't say much but I have lots of years of experience, and the millennials had all the opps.  I was pushed out and never told why.  I would still come back if I'm recognized for what I can do."
good,Haven't had a raise in 3 years nor time off as a contractor. Very different environment in Purchasing - people do not correspond with one another during the day. Open cubicles where you hear everything that goes on in the office.  Very rigid environment.
good,"Like myself, other employees with a many of years in the company were treated poorly and unfairly. This company used to be a great place to work or start a career. It has gone down the drain the past few years."
good,"If you work for NG, be sure to be insulated from the government employees that you are working with.  Do not take a job where you interact directly with them."
good,"typical corporation, profit before people."
good,Good place to work and a good diverse culture. Flexible working hours with good healthcare and benefits. The Cafeteria offers gourmet food.
good,As with most contracting companies the corporate company promotes one thing and local management does their own thing anyway. There were multiple complaints about HR issues and treatment of employees but nothing was ever done. Working in a secluded area like Wallops they pay extremely low and there is no opportunity to advance your career.
good,"Removed and replaced components, enjoyed working with the"
good,"I worked for a division that was bought out by Northrop Grumman.  After a few years, NG began pushing their management style down to these new acquisitions.  The culture in the IS department is all about managers promising more than what can be delivered and punishing you when you inevitably fail.  The culture is such that people being promoted to the highest level of incompetence is the norm.  Compensation it about $10-15,000 less than other departments like AS.  Promotions are nowhere.  Sad, sorry place."
good,"Better company to work for, but Management is bad. there are nothing more to say about other than bad management."
good,Excellent growth in UAV market but not a great place for women to advance.
good,Typical day at work putting out fires.
good,"The company has various opportunities in various technical fields, however the management is the most significant problem within the company.  They do have good benefit programs and are great if you are entry level, otherwise most of the talented technicains and engieneers almost always leave for something better."
good,"If you're absolutely enthralled with aerospace and the idea of building rockets then Northrop Grumman might be a good fit for you, otherwise its a very average place to work with barely average pay and below average benefits. Overtime hours will quickly become the metric for how much value you're providing the company and will directly impact your promotion and career opportunities. Company social activities exist, but they are far and few between and frequently require employees to pay for themselves."
good,"Pays well, but very difficult and unsupportive environment. Sort of use Agile to keep management apprised. Big gulf between management and workers. Good luck."
good,"The accountants run everything. If you are an engineer or want to make a difference, this is not the place for you. Management only cares about costs. Award fees are not passed along to the workers."
good,"Experience at Northrop Grumman will vary depending on the project you are on. A project can move at a snail's pace or be very rapid and stressful. There are many brilliant people that work there and many of the ones with long term experience will tell you it was better before Northrop Grumman acquired their former company (Orbital ATK, TRW, etc). The benefits and work life are watered down to be inlined with the rest of the defense industry meanwhile comparing them to, say, the software industry leaves a lot to be desired."
good,"Northrop Grumman lost their Arkansas contract in 2017."
good,"I was a contractor and they only had one client for me."
good,"I experienced financial hardship, health and medical issues from work caused injury from stressful unsafe environment culture that hindered productivity & resulted in disability. Once disabled, still desiring to work, I was discarded without accommodation. This unfair treatment has effected my family (food & shelter) adversely, which co-workers also suffered. I'm not bitter about my treatment of which we're yet to recover, but it affects this honest review."
good,"I applied for over 15 jobs at Northrop in 7 years and never received any advancement, Why? "
good,"Micromanagement at it's finest."
good,Workload is overwhelming with no concern from project management. Have had turn over of entire team in three years and currently have no direct manager. Work is tedious and guidance changes from day to day.
good,"good working environment at customer site. user community was friendly and agreeable. no flexability with customers site, very controlled."
good,"if you work in Rough Fab be on the look out for Aaron Solan. He is a snake. The company can terminate you for no reason at any time. From time to time they do exactly that. I believe that option is exercised to maintain a level of fear, intimidation & uncertainty about your job security."
good,NG is going through a culture shift. It will remain to be seen if the intent of the shift will be reflected by the managers tasked with executing it.
good,"A typical workday consist of many status update meetings and very little time to actually do you work.  You will learn that this company does not promote growth.  Everything you actually learn about engineering will have to be conducted on your own time.  Your coworkers are great because they are in the same miserable position that you are.  Many just want to make it a few more years into retirement.  The hardest part of your job is going to it.  The most enjoyable part of your job is leaving it.  Day-to-day, you will notice many VIP tours of customers and corporate hotshots walking through the labs observing you working. They'll expect you to explain what you're working on in remedial terms that they can understand.  You will have to keep your work area clean just in case they stop in unannounced.  Expect no opportunities to train and no mentors.  Work starts immediately when the contract gets funded but takes weeks to trickle through the finance unit until there is something an engineer can charge to.  Once those charge numbers are activated weeks later, you're already behind schedule.  There is a big push for employees to compete their engagement surveys about the quality of  your work environment.  From the results of the engagement survey, your group is supposed to come up with corrective actions. First, the corrective actions can not cost the company any money and second, must not be worked on during work time.  A proposal to train on personal time using company equipment was denied.  Actually, ever proposal put forth by our group has been denied.  It's an absolute mess."
good,"Cons:  Everyone are always afraid of being laid off. This can cause some people not wanting to share knowledge. You are always starting over on a different project, adapting"
good,"Communications could use improvement. LA area too expensive to live near company sites. Company should strongly consider moving as many of their operations from California to Florida/no tax state. Management should allow and embrace remote/virtual work for employees living close to other company locations and eliminate need for daily face-time when not necessary. This will help to reduce number of cars on the road, emissions, and gas and wear/tear on cars. It will also help to improve work/life balance and moral of employees having to deal with the millions of cars and long commutes through extreme and unsafe weather conditions at times. Long hours already expected, but those of us having to commute into LAX, have an additional 4+ hr day thanks for the commute times! If the company wants to retain employees in these kinds of work locations, they need to be more flexible and not try to chase good people away."
good,"This is the cleanest place I have worked for.  I enjoy the work and the employees I work with.  There is entirely too many managers on each aircraft (7) on the one I work on.  The nepotism is flagrant here and it does not give the opportunity to become a permanent employee.  I inspect the heavy check aircraft, inspect the mechanical backshop, the electrical backshop and the test bed aircraft.  I have knowledge in working with measurement tools.  I enjoy working with the other contractors.  The regular employees mostly look down on us."
good,Management is extremely resistant to change.  Good old boy network rules the roost
good,Do the typical program control task
good,Too much politics in company rather than performance review is based on technical know how.
good,The company seems to focus more on diversity and continuous turnover rather than balance and value of their senior level employees. Continuous organizational restructuring due to diversity incentives such as female leadership and younger less experienced technical work force has caused the company to fail on meeting milestone commitments. Although the company advertises and promotes diversity unfortunately this has become an internal morale problem as the senior experienced employees are no longer valued and often incentivesed to retire or seek employment outside of the company.
good,Good inside job for 22 years till they laid me off for no reason. Made the company a lot of money over the years and worked six days a week for the majority of my tenure there. Away from my family eighty percent of the time.
good,I love working that the company good retirement benefit. But they didn't offer full to get health benefits and they had a layoff. Not very stable company.
good,Northrop Grumman is the lowest paying company for IT Professionals. They issue job titles that are not industry standard in order to pay low salaries.
good,I have worked in the aerospace industry for 10 years there are good jobs and bad jobs ever since our company was bought out by Northrop Grumman things just fell apart like the domino effect our job titles changed which also changed the amount of growth we get quarterly along with raises depending on your manager. if you are looking to grow your career in your field and have been doing this longer than 10 years I would advise that until the problems are fixed and addressed here don’t come here
good,Looking for a position where I can excel with my experience. My background in Procurement of 32 years as a Manager and Senior Procurement Analyst will support any Aerospace firm such as Boeing and Raytheon.
good,"Overall a fair place to work.  Advancement is difficult, especially for senior level employees.  Benefits are pretty good, but medical is expensive. Average matching on 401K compared to the other Aerospace companies.  Lots of red tape.  People are mostly nice, but there are issues with accountability."
good,This place was cut throat everyone was using others to step on to get ahead. The workers tried to find the easiest way to get the job done even if that meant sacrificing safety.
good,Jobs are always at risk due to budget cuts. Management always under pressure working 12 - 15 hour days. Required to do more with less. New college graduates have better opportunities since they are paid less.
good,due to the nature of my job i can not explain much on the day to day. the hours are not ideal if you enjoy a personal life and the management at my level is disappointing.
good,"Fun working with different technicians, learned a wide range of test equipment associated with Navy's torpedo program. Management was very hard on employees. as a hold, work place environment was a great place to work. The hardest part the amount of qualification involve with the type of work. The most enjoyable part of the job is the location."
good,It was a good job at first but i did work a lot with chemicals and had to wear chemical suit to clean product. I met a lot of nice people and learned a lot. I trained someone that had more seniority than me and she ended up taking my job
good,"Mundane.  There is really nothing to say about working here.  You just come to work and go home.  There is really no guidance from leadership, just try to figure what they want from you.  Not really conducive to a good working environment"
good,"Its an okay job, I think my job is the one out job. I want to believe that other groups are better than my experience I have had so far there."
good,"I'm not allowed to know what it takes to get a promotion, because they probably won't give me one if I meet the qualifications.  My healthcare deductible has tripled in two years.  Managers only want to deliver minimum viable product that will get defunded if the government thinks they may have to actually field the product."
good,Reorganizations are common.  The best part of the job was the flexible schedule and the people. Basic benefits were provided for part time and full time employees.
good,I was a apprentice and I left do to the Poor Management and leadership. After seeing the poor workmanship that goes in to the ships. I would never let anyone in my family sail on a ship that Newport News Shipyard built.
good,"A typical day starts with looking at my calendar to see what meetings I must attend during the day.  After that, I plan my day to figure out which elements of my job I need to focus on (these are my goals for the day).  I then set out to accomplish my goals in the midst of my many meetings.  "
good,Trouble moving up the ladder of advancement. Demanding job with little to no gratitude to employees. Very stable job once hired on.
good,Vinnell Arabia was an interesting place to work. A typical day was fighting the traffic to get to work without getting into a wreck with a Saudi. I learned about the arab culture and how to write a lesson plan they would except. Management was somewhat like the military or they thought they were. Co-workers were great people to work with very knowledgable and professional. The hardest part of the job was being away from my wife and kids. Creation of lesson plans and coming home for visit.
good,"Preforming services on fleet some time repetitive work"
good,"do whatever possible to work around slow managers, lots of red tape, deep IN the box thinkers, drone managers."
good,"This division and project leadership appears fettered and possibly weak, due in part to political and contractual constraints.  The sub contractor is unethical, at the very least, and the City agency heads appear to be skilled players of ""Game"".  I hate to be so vague, but I am trying to write a review without getting sued.  Mine are impressions based on my limited view.  What seems to be, to me, could just be a matter of perspective and available information."
good,Great place to work.  Relocation left a lot of employees without employment.
good,"Great coworkers, people really care about each other"
good,Basically same as the other big defense contractors. You are a number and no one cares much about your work. Benefits are average and getting worse. Culture is engineer-centric with limited people skills. Management is in denial. It's a paycheck.
good,"A typical day at work would be to accept a build from CM (who ran the build acceptance test, that I provided), proceed to test the new functionality, report any bugs and analyze the bugs for risk and product improvement. Then modify the build acceptance test with the new functionality and deliver it to CM."
good,"Half day Fridays are great, even when you work a few extra hours, the building is pretty much empty by 3PM. Great career opportunities and the company will invest in you if you are hardworking and dedicated. Work-life balance is respected"
good,Typical cubicle office-like environment.
good,Short term contract
good,"No two days are the same, although the culture never changes. Sharp differences between co-workers that have always worked here and those that hired in from other companies or college. Spotty attempts by management to find out why employees are unhappy (Gallup survey) usually end in blaming employees and continuation of management policies & practices without change. Learn a great deal technically as we design/produce complex electronic warfare systems. Most enjoyable part of the job is new Diversity efforts so I have had personal, positive impact on the culture in recent years."
good,"I started here at the beginning of an acquisition. It was a rocky transition with the clash of company cultures. But I did have great coworkers who taught me a great deal, where this was my first Financial Analyst Job out of college."
good,"Good Salary"
good,disconnect between blue and white collar workers.  Blue collar are not valued. Starting pay is not adequate for sustaining live. very difficult to get hired on.
good,"Professional environment. Nice people to work with. Management is a little unpredictable, gives you something to do and two hours later asks the status of the task that has never been assigned.   Dealing with management takes some time to getting used to."
good,No set raises. All merit based. Lots of old tools and equipment. They are building the modern fighter jet with 1970s technology in tools. Unskilled labor thinking they know the job but have no idea what they are doing. 5 months at the local college and you are almost guaranteed a job. Those of us that have an A&P license aren't even utilized as leaders and trainers. Too much horseplay.
good,"Some groups and managers are very good at growing employees and providing good work/life balance.  Some managers really don't care.  Crunch time is inevitable, but for some groups, crunch time is standard operating procedure.  Some opportunities to move around and assignments aren't necessarily tied to one's title."
good,"The most important thing to know is the repetitive motion injuries you can receive there.  The management team micro manages every second while your at work.  This can be very stressful because it feels like they don't trust you to do the job.  You have a mix of friendly people there, with some not so friendly people.  The pay is good, but the health risk and the micro managing of its employees is not worth it."
good,"Overall NG isn't a bad company to work for. In my experience and six year tenure I've learned it just depends on the project sector and leadership team your under. Unfortunately, there has been a lot of reorganization within the company. I truly enjoyed working with the Employee Resource Groups (ERGs). They hold cross functional employee engagement activities which provides all employees outside engagement within the Corporation."
good,felt as if the company hired me to keep a position open for someone whose background check was taking to long very family oriented no to many outsiders you must know someone to become successful in the company.
good,"Other Defense Company,s are better.  Limited coaching, Performance bonuses are really used as retention bonuses.  This means they are geared for younger workers. The performance ratings were tied to the bonuses so older workers were given lower ratings so younger workers could receive them."
good,"I worked at Northrop Grumman for over 30 years as an engineer and manager. Up until about 10 years ago it was a great place to work. They valued employees as people and would go to great lengths to see that the human capital was preserved. That is not the environment now. At least in the IT world. People have little value and are used then thrown out. They are actively recruiting youth. Which is not bad, but it is at the expense of seasoned veterans. Experience is not as highly valued. It's all about the mighty dollar now."
good,"No upward mobility. They are always changing the structure. The company will also inform you that they are not doing as well, decrease benefits, then appoint a VP's on a regular basis."
good,Good contract poor client management. Was well respected but client played games with an attitude.Little if anyhing NG management could do. Location was excellent but contractors treated poorly.
good,"This job was the fulfilling , helping the Soldiers prepare for the eventual Combat/Peacekeeping mission. Ensuring that that are well trained in marksmanship."
good,"Most job requirements can only be met by former military officers with 20 years or more experience.  Frequent, extended travel continued to increase throughout my tenure.  The ability to interact with soldiers and commanders, training them for their wartime mission was very satisfying."
good,"A place to work hard to show case your talent and skills. I learned a tool called CA ERwin data modelling tool. Workplace culture is okay. "
good,"I like working for Northrop Grumman. However, the culture here is not geared for advancement. All roles and extra responsibilities that I have been given here in the past 10 years have been unofficial, functional roles. This way, management can still pay you the low salary of your level 1 position while you are wearing 5 different hats for 3 different contracts. Out of the 100 some coworkers I have worked with, most of them got different positions in different departments or with different companies. Higher level positions inside my department were always hired externally instead of promoting from within. I really wanted to like working for the company but I am spinning tires under current management."
good,"I worked in the call center and it wasn't a great experience.  "
good,"Management is very resistent to new ideas, does not address known Earned Value discrepencies.  Persistent lack of communication within Business Management Divisions (Cost, Labor, Materials, GSC, GFE, and Scheduling) creates disfunctional/stressful work environment and does not fully support Program Management."
good,To advance you have to be related to a manager. Management looks out for their family and friends! They hire family in at an unjustified level and pay because they are in someway related!
good,"I work in assembly on the F-35 Lightening program at the Palmdale CA site. NG has a good reputation generally speaking, but my experience here thus far has been a real ""eye opener."" While attending school to get my foot in the door here, (I could not otherwise & I tried, even with a BA) I was promised the world. The Instructors touted it as the best thing since sliced bread, and they bad mouthed the competition (Lockheed as their primary example). Yet a little over one month in, my accomplished dream of working here has become almost a nightmare at this point. I left another smaller Co. as a Composite Technician/contractor in Mojave CA to come here - a place that I truly enjoyed working at, but this Co. hadn't offered me any permanency, so I was forced to go where I had more security and a future for my family. I can't speak for everyone or each position here at NG, (I'm sure it varies) but generally speaking, the training is almost nonexistent and the management is sub-par, mostly due to a lack of people skills, and huge influx of new employees. It's a ""sink or swim,"" very stressful environment. The numbers are everything, and don't make too many mistakes here, or you'll be ""walked out."" My hope is to weather the storm, put my time in and apply for a different position in a different dept. or leave this Co. all together. Like I said, I can only speak for the F-35 program. It may be ""Peachy keen"" in Engineering or Inspections. ;)"
good,"Typical day would include playing catch up due to the lack of coordination by management. I learned allot about ID and e-learning, no thanks to my supervisor, or any management. I was self taught the entire time I was working at this company. The management was very ""Micro"" and wanted allot of ""YES"" men working for them. The workplace culture is designed to be very work heavy and life last. So, the idea was ""Mission"" first and family/yourself last. The hardest part of the job was getting my fellow teammates to do their job. This was because my supervisor believed that the team was responsible for any slack by any teammates should be carried within the team regardless of the situation."
good,"Its good company to start your career, but if you are looking for competitive compensation look somewhere else. Low pay, job security to some level. Ok management, if you have nice a manager you are in luck, if not good luck."
good,"Not very challenging. Management not technically oriented."
good,"At the time, technical works were in demand and the jobs were available. Such companies had many opportunities for a technician who is willing and able to work."
good,The company is solid and run very well.   I wish they would invest more in the employees and really have constructive ways in which employees can grow
good,the support system was very lacking. Not a strong internal structure that supports growth or encourage the internal core of the company. To many days of being uneasy
good,"Northrop Grumman Lake Charles, is the red headed step child of the corporation and has pushed out the employees that made the site function for almost 25 years to keep on the people from a failed program."
good,Big company atmosphere with many opportunities if you apply yourself.  Many locations and types of work provide opportunities for change and learning.
good,Typical day is to support the lab technicians.  Create bill of material and write purchase req's in the ERP system.  The position is not challenging.
good,I got a long with everyone.  I learned how to deal with stress.  Management is a joke and they need to learn how to communicate.  Co workers are great.  Co workers are the best part of the job.
good,Okay place to work. Contract related and it is all about pleasing the client. Quiet environment. Co-workers try to be supportive.
good,"Overall Northrop Grumman is a company that provides war fighters the tools to be successful, that being said the environment does not have moral.  six reduction in force in three years leaves employees with little hope or moral."
good,Being a retired soldier I believe in providing only the best product to the Warfighter. Knowing of flaws and imperfections should raise flags. The check the block attitude was disheartening. The information provided to the customer and the overlooking of so money and promotions could be accomplished would give America a heart attack.
good,"There were no typical days at Grumman. Every day was different, in a sense of what had to be done on that day. The main thing I learned was how to get along with people better. Management was OK but not great. I got along great with my co-workers some of whom were outstanding at there craft. The hardest part I would say was when a co-worker doesn't carry there weight in a assignment. The most enjoyable part was the relax atmosphere at the job."
good,"Lacks basic organization, No training program for new hires and the evaluation process is a joke. Process flow needs an upgrade. Upper management prevents supervision from doing their jobs."
good,"Working with Northrop taught me a lot about myself and my mechanical hobbies. I learned just that, its a hobby I enjoy not a job that I enjoyed."
good,"There is no real reward for the work you do. Not even a passing ""good job"". The advancement opportunities are horrible and the management never has your back."
good,This company was previously Westinghouse Electronics Systems.  It has had a long history in the Baltimore-Washington area.  Corporate offices moved from CA to the District of Columbia in the last 5 years.  Strongly defense oriented.  Numerous locations in and around the MD/DC/VA corridor. Management is inconsistent . Company pays homage to heavy employee investment however actual results in the form of raises/promotions/opportunities for growth can be very limited.  Culture speaks to an appropriate work/life balance but actual and individual job requirements often mandate lots of extra hours.  Benefits used to be amongst the best in the industry -- this is changing.
good,"Enjoyed the work, but layoffs were on a regular basis.  Left this company before being laid off because I found another job."
good,Corporate culture is a joke.  Management has very little training causing a lot of issues that are not handled correctly.
good,Stable company with good promotional and cross organization opportunities.
good,Great place to work except for constant layoofs with new temp workers being hired in our places.
good,"start 5:30 get work break 8:00 -8:15 "
good,"Northrop Grumman is a leading global security company providing innovative systems, products and solutions in unmanned systems, cyber, C4ISR, and logistics and modernization to government and commercial customers worldwide."
good,"•	Interfaced with engineering, supervision, suppliers, customers to verify processes, procedures and planning are meeting conformance.  "
good,This was one of the worst jobs I have ever had. Management did not know what they were doing and contradicted everything they said.
good,"Typical work day begins at 5am and done at 2:42pm."
good,"Typical day starts at 5:30 AM and ends at 3:30PM. I launch and analyze weekly reports to help drive support and accuracy to the customer, maintain a consistent flow of quality material to the customer and establish regular communication with Suppliers and asset Managers which are critical to the success of the program."
good,Poor supervision was not really in touch with what was going on or what the work load really about. Poor or no equipment to do job that was on hand. Poor
good,"An employee is just a number but if you expect more from an assembly line, you are not being genuine with yourself.  Overall its okay if that's what you want."
good,"Presented Control M to me. A  Job Scheduling tool used with Northrup Gruman to operate their daily workflow. Operations was going through a lot of changes, which kept a lot of employees on each about the contract with the government, which eventually ended."
good,"Bad management. Hard wall between managers and employees. Many personnel have no real world experience with the products, but they read a book. No need to apply if your over 40. Below the surface age discrimination on advancement."
good,"I've been with Northrop Grumman for Eight (8) years and while I have a Master's degree and few others do, advancement is very difficult unless you have a Father or Mothers that works in the company."
good,"NG has many different flex work schedules and remote options but the advancement is slow and pay is not competitive to the market. Management and the culture are ever changing as the older workforce is retiring; which is creating a huge gap between senior skill level, mid range and new employees skills."
good,Good company but my position was locked in for a few years while I am looking to move forward  with my career.  My career has stalled since taking the position.
good,All in all it was not to bad of a place to work at for me but I am sure there are others that would disagree with me.................................................
good,"It is your typical Defense contractor. Works on really cool technology and allow you to grow your career."
good,"I have friends and colleagues who work in other sectors and divisions of the organization and love it. Unfortunately some Sector / Division / Office Locations are known to have retention issues. Middle-Management is out of touch with reality and is poor at setting their team up for success. All they seem to care about is the bottom line rather than rewarding top performers. You just get a pat on the back and a ""keep up the good work"", but rarely see promotion opportunities. Same thing with salary increase opportunities. Only increases are the typical standard cost of living increases which seldom account for anything when you are not compensated fairly to begin with. But again, there are plenty of other locations where it is almost as if you work for a completely different, better, company."
good,"I was let go do to Sequestration.  Although NG did help me find another position within NG.  My experience with NG was, overall, positive.  I wouldn't have left my previous employer for NG if I had known that I would be jettisoned the second the road got bumpy."
good,"They don't plan the work and then place the employees on mandatory overtime to make up time even though they still haven't planned the work to be done, so you will be forced to stay at work with nothing to do."
good,Attrition rate is very high. Poor management. Salary is fluctuating due to the contract negotiations. The work place is overseas and managed from the states which obviously does not work.
good,"There was no flex time.  I struggled with traffic every morning to get to work.  I faced many verbal and written reprimends due to arriving late caused by traffic issues that I could not control.  From a technical standpoint, my managers loved my work.  I did good in the tech area."
good,"People were stove piped and were restricted to what they could say to whom at higher levels of management. Promoted an engaged workforce and promoted employee involvement with solving issues. Too many people were not compensated on an annual basis  due to reaching a high point of there salary grade even though they were top performers. At least a lump sum increase could be awarded instead of returning dollars to the pot to be allocated elsewhere. This caused a disengaged workforce that was told they were getting top salary and they should be happy they had a job."
good,"Northrop Grumman Lake Charles La. "
good,"My job involves managing, supporting, operating, maintaining, installing, doing site surveys, integrating, and outfitting rooms with the latest AV technology"
good,"I garnered a host of skills there, mostly in IT, but in business development and a number of areas. Some of the managers were very good, others, not so. I started out with two good managers who were very helpful, and finished with one that the government customer told me should not be a manager. Guess which one is still there? Government contracting is not generally a good place to be. Unless you have friends high up, it is a short term assignment. Hours were good. Pay was ok, at the time. Lots of nice people. But pager duty is a nightmare because they design ""high availability"" systems that go down frequently. Expect to get called most nights you are on rotation. Blech!"
good,"This company was decent to work for, honestly depends on the department manager.  No open door policy even told there was, pay wasn't the great, but they do pay for schooling."
good,"It still has a little bit of feel of smaller company pre-acquisition Orbital, but that won't last.  It's only been about 3 months and already it's getting the big company bloated feeling, de-personalized.  It's sad to see the end of Orbital.  My manager is horrible -- completely flaccid and impotent -- and the program I'm on is so badly managed that I have a hard time believing how they've successfully launched any satellites."
good,"I only worked at Northrop for a year, than they laid me off along with 500 other people. I had no job during the holidays. My time at Northrop was alright."
good,A dangerous and noisy place to work.  Very dirty and stressful.  The compensation does not match the stress and amount of work that is required.  Parking is horrible.
good,"Overall, NG is a good company to work for from what I can see so far. Great benefits and competitive pay. The downside is dealing with numerous broken processes, and the inevitable politics and red tape that go with working in the defense industry. Managers seem out of touch with the day-to-day process and attend numerous meetings. There also seems to be about 3 managers for every working employee."
good,It's not what you know at this job. It's who you know. Managers play favorites. Even if you know more or do more they will keep who the boss hires. Also relocated
good,"As a large corporation created by multiple merges, NG has struggled to create a single culture.  Also, due to its nature as a government contractor, work security is not guaranteed.  It is hard to provide a single view of the company as there are so many different businesses and cultures combined into one company."
good,Not happy. The Management in the particular division I interviewed with did not keep the promise of assignment and task as told in the interview.  Found myself bored and feeling not utilized to my potential most days.Not all Northrop Division operate in this manner.
good,Prepare to work your buns off.  Often it was high risk and low reward.  You had to be on constantly alert on your assignments.  You would be your best friend.
good,"I choose not to elaborate, but overall a decent place to work. Not a lot of internal career growth. I have been with the company for years and I see a lot of external hires who don't know as much about the industry, whereas internal candidates don't always get a fare opportunity at these same positions."
good,Arrive one hour before start of work day to open buildings and shops. Conducted roll call then assisted upper management in conducting the shops daily business.
good,The NG division I support does not view the client I support as a key client.  No involvement from senior management.  Rarely ever communicate with my direct manager except for the twice annual performance review.
good,Northrop Grumman is a great place to work with exciting projects.That being said career advancements are often achieved by leaving the company for better opportunities.
good,"Every group is different, so this might not apply everywhere, but it does in more places than not.  Promotions and higher titles have more to do with your years of experience and timing than what you produce.  That makes some of the higher ups complacent with their jobs, and some of the younger employees impossible to move up. If you just want to get by, this can work well for you.  If you want to advance, try looking somewhere else."
good,Feedback comes in the form of finger pointing. Not a fun place to work. Good work is not acknowledged. Mistakes are never forgotten. Impossible to move up. Raises are few and far between.
good,"Place is good to work, however, it is driven by small number of large projects. This invites a culture that promotes a small group of people over otherwise deserving employees."
good,"This job was good but the overall industry is very boring and highly focused on antiquated processes. The technology is improving but there is a very high emphasis on security and that prevents implementing practical solutions. The environment is very slow and good for a starter job. There is also a high rate of turnover so the opportunity is there. However, they are not very good at working with your requirements unless you have been working there for a long time. I had a very long commute but still came to work at a decent time and got all the work that they asked of me done. However, they were fixated on the fact that I could not come any earlier to meetings that would last the entire business day and really were not relevant to me at all. I understand that you want me to get the full company experience but if I am performing my duties I believe that should be sufficient. Instead they told me that I was using my long commute as a crutch and basically did not want to hire me from there."
good,"Northrop Grumman started out as a great place to work. Salary was good and working conditions were favorable. Now there is a lot of uncertainty surrounding the job security. There have been constant talks of layoffs. There has been a reduction in contract labor by at least 90%. The future and Grumman does not appear to be a good one. This is an opinion shared among nearly all current employees at Northrop Grumman, Lake Charles"
good,"The summers are brutal, the winter isn't any better, but the money is decent. I learned how to weld at their welding school and really appreciated the attention to detail provided by my instructor."
good,"Not much excitement working here. It's a giant behemoth place to work. For most engineers you will feel like a peon working here. They are steeped into the ""we've always done it that way here"" mentality. If you say we did it this way at company X it will never be adopted."
good,"After 30 years I would say the first 15 were great the next 10 were okay and the last 5 torture.  I feel sympathy for my younger co-workers; there is little chance for advancement and the work can be mind numbing.  The individual contributors are great but management is ""old school"".  They are drowning in procedures that are poorly written, hard to understand and constantly changing.  Every year the compensation package appears to shrink, and raises of 1-3% annually won't keep up with inflation.  The 9/80 work week is great but flex time is at your managers discretion and is offered only to a favored few.  The attrition rate at my division is high, and it takes months to hire anyone, IF they hire a replacement at all.  Employee surveys are given ""lip service"" no meaningful changes have come out of them and the results haven't improved in 5 years.  That speaks volumes."
good,NGC is an excellent place to work. The benefits are great. I can work in pj's! Work life balance becomes difficult and 40 hrs/week isn't often enough.
good,"Processes are unorganized"
good,"This is a great place to launch your career after college. Almost every employer in the area is willing to hire you after you have received 3-5 years of experience working in various roles at NG. Northrop also has one of the best education payment policies. If you want to grow your career, get the experience and educational benefits and then leave. Advancement at this company is based on who you know and not what you know, how qualified you are, or what your experience is."
good,"Like any other place, it depends on your management team. Not a difficult job. Will have to change jobs in order to advance."
good,Management at the office constantly had hands tied in assisting people under them by their managers. The ability for advancement of job or work environment was not there.
good,Management often used the stick over the carrot. People were often scared rather than rewarded for their work. This does not work well for young people.
good,The company was good until the dissolution of the ES (Electronic Systems) sector.  Sequestration was the demise of the company.
good,I've learned a lot about the corporate lifestyle at this company.  The peoples attitudes are a direct reflection of the California lifestyle.  The hardest part of my job is the early morning 1 hour plus commutes but the most enjoyable part is the early time off.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is that every now and then you get to work on really neat stuff."
good,"Sit in front of a computer and create drawings using CAD programs. Very little design effort, mostly plug-n-chug. Management doesn't provide enough guidance, or incentive for promotions. No room for growth. Not much in terms of job security, but that's the business of working in the defense industry. The pay is below average for an engineer in the Huntsville, AL area. Good place for a first job, but don't plan on making a career out of Northrop Grumman in the Huntsville, AL area unless you're in the ""in-crowd"". It's not what you know, it's who you know that gets you promoted."
good,The customer we support is not very stable or willing to adapt and I am not doing enough networking so my skills are falling behind my commercial counterparts.  The management leaves you alone to do your job which is a big plus other than that it is like any other defense contractor.  At the customer site you work with other contractors so it is 50/50 on how well you get along with folks there. At our company site everyone is cool.
good,"Good Pay, Good Benefits, Good People but poor management at my location in OKC"
good,"only cares about its bottom line and nothing and no one else; Even after a decade of making money for the company, it will dump an employee the moment that employee stops making money for the company."
good,my co-workers always told my ex-husband what was happening in my personal life if they ever heard anything out of me.  Was not a great work environment.
good,"has been a lot of traveling over the last 8 years,not sure if company cares about employees family life.....for the most part though it has been an enjoyable place to work for the last 30 years"
good,"Loved my co-workers.. Just seemed like a another number at the company. Didn't feel like they cared about us, or appreciated what we did.  HR was pretty good though."
good,"Typical Day at work:"
good,This was my first job on F-35.  I came in at the end and the program was moving on so I did
good,Boring job in the summer but if you can get in the right department it would be worth it.
good,"Since management believed in me, learned new challenging skills throughout the 10 years employed which gave me an opportunity to tackle new endeavors."
good,"There is no way to tell you what to expect, because the recommendations sent down from Corporate are only that.  Each Business Unit and even Operating Unit (smallest business division) can set the policies as they see fit, and in accordance with annual profit levels."
good,It was fine. I enoyed my time at NGC. The hours were good and I always had good managers.
good,".The management teams lacks much needed aircraft skills which is the primary buissnes. This makes for a verry unproductive work environment.The big government contract is the only reason they can stay above water, if not for that reason the company woud be out of buissnes.   "
good,Difficult Management at times and lack of support to complete required tasks. 
good,"NG doesn't mind underbidding to win and then making up the money by overworking the staff that didn't know the project was underbid. Remember, there aren't any laws dictating work hours for salaried employees."
good,"During the three years I have worked for Northrop Grumman, I have learned to manage high priority tasks. I have become a stronger team player and communicator."
good,"At first, it was a great place to go to work but then it all changed when new leadership came in and changed the culture and was not looking for any work for our facility"
good,"During my tenure with NGC, it was evident that the organization offered limited career advancement. Unfortunately, my direct management team did not support training or career advancement; thus resulting in my resignation after approximately 4 years."
good,This is my first Job after the military and college and i must say that i am dissapointed... You have to CC your management in order to get noticed or get any credit for hard work.
good,Working for Northrop Grumman has offered me opportunities that otherwise would have been beyond my reach. One of the most relevant aspects of working there has been the varied groups of people one has the opportunity to work with in a number of diverse fields. The introduction to government contracting and its many intricacies has been invaluable. And the culture has helped to nurture my own management and problem solving skills.
good,Spend most of my time turning in userviceable parts for DOL Maint.
good,1. Abused finacial systems
good,"Nice place to work, nice people and lots to do. Benefits are not the best. Great for work/ life balance. They focus on individuals with a degree, some situations this is more harmful than good..."
good,"I'm assigned people to work for me yet some don't do their job, talk all the time, have no creativity or self motivated responsibility to get things done, and keep pushing back the schedule. I have no power to get new people to work for me and functional management seem to only care about keeping their people happy and focus on the positive. As result, a select few top performers need to shoulder the weight of slackers and these high performers still get paid about the same (even tho i advocated for them and made it very clear to their functional) only small annual merit increases. Either fire the unproductive people and pay the productive people more, or you will lose key people and also experience many more roadblocks/headaches because of incompetent people."
good,Your growth at the company depends on your manager and direct lead. There isn't a general training or set standard to get you up to speed. Its up to you to ask as many questions to grow in the company
good,There are lots of locations to work in. It may be hard to transfer between divisions. Many people use it as a stepping stone to another company due to a minimum raise to keep up with the economy and level of experience.
good,"I work for the research facilitation lab in Monterey as a Northrop employee. While Northrop is a great company, the culture at the lab is not very conducive to growth. There are many people in positions of authority that are controlling and do not like it when subordinates have differing views."
good,"Northrop Grumman took over TRW Space, Missile and Defense Corporation which was my original employer for 25 years. It was almost a perfect work environment for many years. It went downhill after Northrop Grumman took over."
good,"the promotion process was usually done in a closed room, it would be best to have a buddy."
good,Management not helpful and try to steer you in the direction they see fit. Minimal advancement once you reach a certain level. From there you're stuck.
good,Not a bad place to work.  Can be a lot of politics which can be frustrating at times.  Good compensation for the most part.  Great place to learn if you have the right manager.  Lots of opportunity to move up and grow.
good,The managers know nothing about their position so it’s very hard to follow instructions. HR just sucks always have always will.They pretend to listen but really are thinking about what’s for lunch or something.
good,"no review, my thoughts are my own and I won't be forced into providing review by Indeed.com. No one should ever be forced, it's absolutely abhorrent to hold applicants hostage to this requirement."
good,"Its an alright place, but the management is weak. It took me 3 weeks to receive a project to work on, and that was only after seeking out a project myself."
good,"This job does not have a good work life balance. Another bad part about the job is you constantly work long hours and the job is very unpredictable, so it’s hard to plan things."
good,I work a a customer site and we don't hear from NGC management very often. I feel we are kind of forgotten since this is the only location in Minnesota.
good,"Working here has its advantage and disadvantages. Educational assistance is good, but career development needs some work. Good starter job for recent college graduate"
good,A new SAP system was implemented Jan 2019.  Lots of fixes and changes.  I am apart of a great team that is supportive and communicates well.  NGC is a global company with lots of disciplines.  The current hiring focus is in Engineering.
good,"Good work life balance. "
good,Nothing to add.  Not my current company.  Not sure why I'm being asked to review this company.  Great company but not a lo of opportunity in my field base on where I hired on with them overseas.
good,"Overall a good place to work.  There is not a lot of room for development due to it being a small site located in Moss Point, Ms.  The hanger is airconditioned and they are on a 4x10 work schedule, which is nice."
good,A lot of double standards with management & not much consistency with support from the management level. Actual job activity is enjoyable. Environment not positive.
good,All I can say is 90% of the people I work with is great. What I learned is nothing. The possibilities of further advancement is not there. The safety person does not really know what he is doing so he makes it up as he goes.
good,Management was  straight to the point and fast paced. I loved that I remained busy all day while working.  Sometimes they're expectations were not realistic I am not a mind reader and the staff didn't always just say what they needed or wanted you to do. The guys could use better communication skills instead of assuming you understand.
good,Good job for most people. If you're willing to go to school they will pay as long as it is applicable to a position you are seeking within the company.
good,"The company was ok. my experience there was a bit brief due to my recent relocation however , they  have room to improve greatly"
good,"Confused place to work . If you want more in your life you will not let them to buy your time.People at work maybe don""t care after a period of time.In 10 years no advancement."
good,This is a large company with lots of opportunities for advancement but it seems like a few people do  the bulk of work while too many skate and do very little.
good,"Recognized my skills in MBSE in A&D.  Good remote productivity."
good,Work was hard physically moving heavy material. Keeping yard and work areas clean was a constant. Constantly moving material as need all over the yard. Trying to find contacts for the material.
good,"10 years working for Northrop Grumman as a field support rep maintaining equipment at postal sites. Duties included weekly, monthly, quarterly maintenance of Biohazard Detection Systems (BDS). Job required driving company van to all assigned sites on a daily basis (400,000 + miles and 3 vans over the 10 year period)."
good,Fast pace work environment Management  often out of touch with the scope of work. They often struggle keeping employees gainfully employed. Poor communication. Employees often uninformed about daily goals.
good,"Only heard good things about Northrop Grumman and was very excited to be hired. Unfortunately, the little corner of the company I worked in didn't really care about keeping their people when contracts were downsized. Too many other priorities were at play and I was pushed to the wayside. Unfortunate, the benefits at the time I worked there were outstanding."
good,"Managers are horrible at managing. Lead welders and fitters will throw you under the bus quickly. No leadership, no accountability. Decent pay but not for the area. Guys lived in the parking lot."
good,"Quality company that focuses on recruiting qualified, quality candidates. Strong focus on the individual performance and team building exercises. Heavy focus on heritage employees."
good,NGTS is difficult to work for. Lack of planning and support. The job itself is great. Many issues with GMO and Accounting. Upper management does not share all information.
good,"Depending on the department you work it, work/life balance is taken very seriously. Unfortunately, there are other areas where they are not as conscientious about that. "
good,Great job and schedule. I enjoyed working with customers and fellow employees. Poor organizational culture. I enjoyed the job because it required mental agility and creating solutions to complex issues on short notice. The pay and benefits were excellent. The 4 by 10 schedule was excellent.
good,"Fair enough in many ways, i.e., compensation. Program for pushing out the older folks was painfully obvious.  We've all discussed it amongst ourselves.  The Millennials can't possibly build an airplane from the bottom up without us!"
good,"Northrop is a good place to start.  As any career, you have to chart your own part.  Management has their own ideas and vision for employees.  One has to forge ahead to achieve their own vision."
good,My manager didn't know what work we were doing and didn't ask. Contract was low-balled had to lay off people that would have been useful to the project going forward.
good,work schedule and demands from management change about every 90 days. not consistent. the people that we work with are wonderful they make it worth being there each and every day and knowing we are putting the warfighter back in the air is a great feeling.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is receiving a job that has not been started by another mechanic. Then parts are available when needed and no constraints to finish.
good,"The only individuals who have a chance at advancement or even to attend training courses are those the ""Management"" establishes ""relationships"" outside of work.  Competence and Actual Job Performance does not guarantee opportunity or even retention.  If you are their friend, they will do all they can do to retain you over someone more qualified or better performing."
good,"The rolling Meadows site for NGC is very old school.  Projects are still run as waterfall (although they are trying to change).  Change is needed, but extremely slow.  Seniority and Command and Control culture is very strong and causes a lot of roadblocks to innovation.  Manual testing is still king (and still extremely inefficient).  Tons of bureaucracy and waste in the antiquated tools and process.  The culture is rather non-existent.  Communication is constantly a problem."
good,"See it ...Own it....Solve It...Do It...The NGC Roll"
good,I enjoyed the job and all the information that I did learn that management was horrible and it was pretty Cutthroat environment. Management had his few couple of people that he lights and if you weren’t one of them he let you know about it
good,"From a software development and engineering perspective, they are locked in the 90s. I can only attribute it to the lack of cross pollination of ideas, techniques, and best practices from other companies and other business sectors."
good,"This program was a great place to work to gain experience and make contacts. I would view it more as a stepping stone for young professionals or a place to finish out your career as a senior professional. The compensation leaves much to be desired, however, the company was very competent as a whole and the management was top notch."
good,"Northrop Grumman failed to provide the job that I originally agreed to fill.  Assigned to a lower tier Subcontract Administration assignment that was well below my level of expertise thus causing frustration and very little job satisfaction.  Generally the work environment was good and my co-workers became friends. During my five month tenure, I only met with my Manager four times for very brief periods.   The Manager was located in Los Angeles while I worked in San Diego.  Very little management support."
good,"Northrop Grumman has some great policies. Upper management seems concerned with the employees and preserving talent."
good,"Great job stability, but poor career advancement.  Wages not competitive for job requirements.  The people working here are some of the best I've met.  Colleagues are generally great to work with."
good,"When I was there, they did an extremely poor job of investing in their employees. There was no career path, and no easy way to match an employee up with potential work. Employees cut from contracts would be put on the ""Available Talent List"" and have just a few weeks to find themselves another project to bill against, or risk being RIFed. Yet there was no easy way for those employees to search across the company and find all available openings. Instead it was best to rely on an internal network, if you had one, which was very hit or miss. There is little reason for this, as they always need people, and are often recruiting outside the company, even while letting people go who couldn't find their next gig. This is a major failing of Northrop, and means it is a company that really makes it difficult to expect to have a long career."
good,"remove and replace front spar, air compresser engines. vertical stabilizer, close tolerance drilling. basically . systems remove and replace . corrosion control . rem"
good,"Work was challenging which was great, people were hit and miss on how willing they were to work with anyone. They like to work off ""perception"" which is never a good way of doing business. Mgmt has their favorites and spent more time trying to advance their careers than working with their teams."
good,The program I worked on suffered many internal problems within higher management. I did not have a good sense on NGC overall since I was a temp worker.
good,"Dear I when and did my job.   I did  have more than one supervisor but all assignments  were done on time"
good,"Competitive and Interesting work. Morale isn't great and they don't build up their employees very well. If you're ok with staying where you are, then it's ok."
good,"Like everything, its what you make out of it. This company"
good,"Long days with flexibility.  "
good,"Really liked it there for the first 6 years at first then it began to very fast pasted and demanding. Less time with family. Very we paid and really like working on airplane. Also, enjoyed working together as a team."
good,This is a fairly decent company. Like all companies it has its good and bad but for the most part its solid. Northrop has been a leading defense contracted company for some years now.
good,"* Some departments and managers were great to work for."
good,the people are very good to work with. It's a very diverse environment at the lower levels. Leadership state they focus on diversity but don't practice it at higher levels. Minorities are capped at manager levels and rarely see director level in engineering.
good,"Forecasting Department, analyzed Long and Short Lead Times for CVN 21 Shipbuilding contract. Prepared parts for procurement, working closely with Planning and Designing departments for part number accuracy, prior to ordering. Responsible for loading new part numbers into 3D Models for verification."
good,"Compared to other companies, this place is too cheap for providing needed software tool, education and basic cutting corners. Company doesn't want to invest in it's employees...they are just looking for overall profit and nothing else."
good,"The work was challenging and engaging. I worked with many people across departments on numerous programs and because of this, networking was very easy. There was a good mix of software development as well as hardware troubleshooting. Juggling between programs was never really a challenge and there's never a moment where there's nothing to do that day. "
good,"Started out as a great place to work but workplace culture and outdated management wore you down, so many senior management  procedures left you very little time to do the real job, very poor work life balance."
good,"Northrop Grumman  leading global security company providing innovative systems, products and solutions to government and commercial customers worldwide. Fairly average pay and benefits, nothing special. 401k match maxes out at 7% for new employees, if you contribute 8%."
good,"Workplace culture is quite bad, old fashioned, the club of old folks who have been working there for years. Mgmt claim they want innovation, but they do not want change. Not a place for creative young engineers. Positive aspect: pay quite good, possibility to take classes and be part of a large company."
good,"This was and interesting job I did, but the way we were laid off was not. We all worked hard and did our best to put out a good product, but in the end it was not enough to save a company they bought for only a part of and later sold."
good,working at northrop grumman has helped me expand my knowledge on many things. Everyday I help end users with issues with hardware or software. Helping people is very rewarding here in this company.
good,"Contracted to the US Government to run a DoD project.  Managed Network and Security.  Good team, poor management, DoD is a very political place to work."
good,"Working on a ship in construction is a very dirty job, and takes a toll on the body. Hot as H in summer cold as H in winter. Trying to splice fiber is a challenge and often frustrating.  Management is only concerned with the numbers."
good,"Basically, it depends on what group you are in.  Hint, watch out for project manager body languages, attitude, etc during the interview.  Your instinct will tell you."
good,"This was a dynamic work environment. I was basically a catch all at this organization. I worked as an Administrative Assistant, a system administrator, a lab manager, wireless lab engineer, programmer, network security specialist, and a procurement specialist. Management was okay. Lots of turnover during my time there. It was a government contract. Hardest part of the job. Limitations to changes we could effect. Most enjoyable part of the job was the fact that we were able to try new things. I was given a lot of chances to gain new experience."
good,NG is getting rid of the older engineers. Management has changed 100% from technical to business oriented. So you manager does not understand what you do.
good,"Higher management never bothered to find out about the ""little people"".  Everyone at the local site was friendly and easy to work with. I really enjoyed working with them."
good,Environmental work conditions unacceptable.  No controlled environment.  Dirty with no regard for acceptable working conditions. Hot in summer time cold in winter
good,"Northrop Grumman has some great people and some great management.  However, Northrop Grumman is sometimes forced to adhere to investor expectations which sometimes runs counter to what the employees expect."
good,This was a good job to have. It exposed me to many different cultures and the wide range of things that go on in Citizenship and Immigration services.
good,They offer really good benefits but have a lot of mandatory overtime. I wasn't there long enough to see the advancement aspect of the company
good,"I truly enjoyed WHAT I did and the co-workers were amazing! The management lacked in communication severally and their training program was non-existent. I loved the fact that I was able do different things within the company, sometimes on a regular basis."
good,"Not much to say about them."
good,The company is good and provides a lot of flexibility and a wide range of the programs that can be pursued. Many locations across the US and the company will relocate you if needed.
good,"There is job security and benefits. There are no shortcomings in terms of running out of work.  The benefits are really good too since they take care of their people, but growth is pretty difficult."
good,"Seems to change the structure of the organization every 12-18 months and then you have to interview for your own job or a new job.  Health benefits don't pay for anything since the Affordable Care Act (aka ObamaCare) went into effect.  Just merged two huge sectors NGIS and NGES into NGMS but did not merge the budgets, health benefits, vacation schedules, software or access to sites.  So we tell the world we are one company but in fact we are two companies squeezed together trying to figure out how to create reports on two totally different systems.  By the time we get them merged I'm sure we will go through yet another org change.  Very frustrating!"
good,"Building aircraft carrier and subs it is a really good feeling to support your country. The traffic is really bad and parking is worse so finding a parking spot is hard sometimes. A day is typically 8 to 14 hours long it is really easy to get burned out. Lower management typically has less experience that the workers. Upper management is typically  good at connecting with the workers, at least better than lower management. The hardest part of the job is getting the lower management to realize that there is no magic pill to fix the problem. Being part of history and building the next best ship for the NAVY is very fulfilling."
good,"I'm a Senior Systems Engineer"
good,It is an ok place to work if you have no higher aspirations of education.  You have to know or be related to gain upper management.
good,"Comraderie, freedom to be innovative, sharing ideas with fellow co-workers, flying on company jet, company employee store was great."
good,"Many parts of NG are great, but there are others that are not so great.  It is hit or miss which one you will end up in.  Great for promoting people that are willing to relocate for that promotion, but staying in one place limits career growth."
good,Great place to learn how software implementation should work. The people who work there are great. The company provides all the benefits you need.
good,"The Northrop Grumman Aerospace Sector finance organization in Oklahoma City is not a good work environment.  The organization has experienced excessive turnover within the past year with 10+ employees leaving due to lack of training, lack of advancement and lack of responsible management."
good,Great for anyone under 35 but overlooked if not part of club.  Has serious inclusion issues and most definitely part of old boys network.
good,Get The money when you start or you never will unless you are family or close friend. Otherwise pretty good place to work.
good,"work involves multiple activities like monitoring daily jobs, development, documentation etc..co-workers are very helpful and cooperative, client provide enough time to complete the tasks."
good,One of the benefits of working for NG in the Atlanta office is that many of the projects are remote. Some of the best Project Managers in the industry are employed here.
good,"Dependent upon your manager and his or her approach on business can make for a great work and productive atmosphere or a daily routine full of concern. I worked for an individual that, to this day, was the absolute best boss anyone could ever want. All of his employee's were productive, loved to come to work each day and left with a smile on their face. Upper management reorganized our department and placed an individual in charge that never managed people. Needless to say, what was a wonderrful environment turned into one that was unhappy, disconcerned and couldn't wait for the day to end. My coworkers were the best. I couldn't have asked for better. Everyone got along even after the management change. The hrardest part of my job was wondering what the new management would find fault with. We would provide support in a way instructed and the next day it was no longer correct. The work was the best and I enjoyed that component, but the micromanagement and the demeaning ways new management approached everyone was terrible."
good,"Peer Review of drawings, models and designs"
good,Great people/peers but management does not seem to care about you much.
good,loading an un loading of ammo learned how to use a forklift .management was not to helpful with anything .co-workers were the best part of this job
good,"Difficult environment. Received conflicting directions from different sources.,"
good,"If you want to work for a company for 33 yrs and get laid off, Help,"
good,This is a repeat of another review.  I'll delete it when I get through these mandatory prompts.  I don't need to review the same company twice.
good,"The job was good, but the salaries were low-balled. Very demanding work, but overall great work experience."
good,"It is a big company focused on projects and performance, not much different with other contract company."
good,Northrop Grumman Technical Services could have been a great place to work with a little more knowledgeable management team.
good,"NG is a very large company, but most of the work is performed within much smaller programs closest to the customer. The company has great benefits. Working closely with the customer has its benefits as well. However, NG management is heavily rewarded for financial performance of the individual program. When that becomes compromised, they are quick to take it out on the employees."
good,"Good company overall, truly wish I had the opprtunity to advance within the  company."
good,"Work can be fast paced and hectic and as with most large companies sometimes you can feel like just a number, the the people that you work with are like family and make it worth while."
good,Working at Remotec allowed me to perform as the CFO for the organization. Every aspect of a small company financials had to be addressed. The parent company required monthly transmissions of performance and weekly updates on various factors of performance.  The site contained approx. 100 people which lead to knowing the employees on a personal basis.
good,Hard to work for this company because of contract restraints ad layoffs
good,Way to many levels of management and they are very disconnected. You are only a number and they try to keep your pay down as much as possible but require more than your job requires.
good,"coworkers are more important than the work itself."
good,"Responsible for installing, maintaining, and configuring the current RFID inventory database utilizing Microsoft Access 2007 relational database and Microsoft SQL Server 2003/2008.  Conduct monthly Performance Analysis Reviews with management to inform current employee performance.  Assist with monthly internal/external inventory audits and provide status information to management regarding solutions to become more efficient.  Create inventory and financial summary change reports and metrics for the customer that present all Government Furnished Equipment, Contractor Acquired Property, Cycle Counts, Labor Costs Vs. Budgets, KPI, COCA, and ROI. Carefully observe and correct all inventory discrepancies to adjust and uniform information across all databases."
good,I can only assume the company is attempting to downsize and become an attractive candidate for a merger or buy out.   The whole defense industry is having difficult times.
good,Dealing with sole source suppliers and an aging product with no available outside source to go to.
good,Loved working here.  Advancement opportunities were slim but management and co-workers were the best.  We worked hard and played hard.
good,"Good morning. I was a former employee of northrop grumman.My job while working for them was working in logistics. While working for the company I excelled very quickly starting out as a contractor until I was offered a fulltime positon with the company to were I did except. I did learn a lot there,such as lean implamentation,some computer programing, through o.D.U course of study.My co-workers there at the time were great,we all worked very well together.The hardest part of the job for me was,sometimes I guess I enjoyed what I did so much I didn't sometimes know how to go home. Driving the folklift and putting away the matierals inside the warehouse,as well as painting. As far as management. I saved that for last because of the wrog full discharge I got from the supervisor that I had at that time. Don't want to go into details right now but willing to discuss later if need be."
good,Most days consisted of too many meetings and not enough time to actually do the engineering work. Co-workers were great to work with and were always willing to share information. The project work was widely varied so I learned alot about alot of different technologies but never able become an expert on any. The hardest part about the job was the travel but that could be the most enjoyable part at times also.
good,"Validate Assembly Instructions to ensure accuracy, compliance with the BOM."
good,Gained experience across a variety of organizations within the company and received opportunities to collaborate with employees for multiple community outreach initiatives.
good,"The engineering people are a notch above. My last project was challenging and afforded me the opportunity to expand into areas that I hadn't had the opportunity to do before. It may my days go by too fast. However, HR is incapable of handling a difficult and non-performing employee. 'He scares the h... out of me too' is NOT an sufficient response to a report/complaint."
good,"Great products, good people, but company lacks advancement opportunities. Culture is old (still has dress codes, no telecommuting options, no 'newer' benefits, no wifi, no cell phone allowed, etc). Facilities are old."
good,"I enjoyed what I did for NGC, but I left because the pay was not competitive with what I could make else where. I tried to work with management to resolve this but to no avail so I left."
good,"Always had work to do, lots of overtime. flexible schedules."
good,"Arrive to work 40-45 minutes early. Unlock front gate, rear gate and building entrance. Proceed to run production reports for any late entries from the day before. Load work orders to leads, mechanics and helpers. Follow up on all loose ends from the day before and proceed to check on all production issues for the day."
good,My typical day included contacting potential employess regarding their onboarding process. Level helpdesk support and entering compensation and job data.
good,"Northrop Grumman Shipbuilding is now Huntington-Ingalls Industries. The company as Northrop Grumman Shipbuilding was only mildly better than it was as Huntington-Ingalls Industries. Because Northrop Grumman had a Corporate office that provided limited oversight of its sectors, there was a bit more corporate responsibility expected; therefore, shipyard management had to follow a protocol that provided some fairness and parity. Under Northrop Grumman, there was more job security, as well, due to the stability of the corporation. Although problems were still pervasive in the shipyard, there was at least hope that under the larger Northrop Grumman umbrella, these problems would ultimately be resolved, or at least, justly compromised."
good,"Working at Lake city I’m able to make good money. The hours are good. I like working the three days and then four days the next week."
good,Heavy workload but repetitive tasks. It is a great place to start off to gain more Human Resources experience but little room for advancement and growth
good,"If you not part of the good ol boys club or you don't fit into their concept of operations or their way of doing things you're scrutinized, bullied until you quit or they look for ways to terminate you."
good,"Some managers also don't confront performance issues ""head-on"".  Accountability is not throughout all the ranks - it is in pockets, but not throughout."
good,Workers are great management sucks. Company is only interested in keeping the clients happy. Impossible deadlines are set for deliveries so not so ready products are delivered.
good,I had a great experience working at the office site for the client.  Management didn't really try to get to know the staff that worked at the clients office.  If you weren't at corporate you were forgotten.
good,It is a good place to work to start your career. It can equip you to be successful in your future endeavors. The work culture is very inclusive and your are a welcome addition.
good,use this opportunity to grow your skills and move around within the company. lots of opportunities for growth in other sectors. large organization allows much career advancement
good,Northrop supports the government and has plenty of old systems. It feels like a dated company in today's tech world but one that has use skills and knowledge. I would only recommend it to early and late career individuals as it lacks real innovation and excitement but has plenty of opportunities to learn.
good,"NG is a standard corporate culture. The management quality and talent varies with the project you work on. If you produce, you're good. If not, you're gone."
good,"The majority of my years here have been really good. The last couple have been awful, with some improvement in the last few months. Management promotes very few from within and despite multiple people quitting during the last year out of frustration, they have recently posted a req for Sr Principle Systems Engineer - Integration and Test. There are only a few remaining people on the team with experience. They will leave if this position is not filled from within. I'm not training any more people hired in to positions that current employees are well qualified for."
good,Manager was self serving and don't available to the techs. when needed. Did not really provide good leadership. Found that the times that senior staff was onsite to review operations that the manager did not defend or represent the interest of his technicians.
good,Management constantly tells us they well get us stuff to do our jobs. They never do. There is so much red tape I am surprised anything gets done at all.  Any ideas they have never gets implemented correctly. Huge lack of foresight. Approx 70% of machinist are set to retire in the next 5 years. They are not cross training the few employees that plan to be their another 15 to 20 years.
good,"Northrop was a good company. I had a lot of good workers, all attempting to make the company a better place. Maintaining earning compliance with the government contracts was a hassle."
good,It was one of the top companies that I had listed coming out of A&P school until I got there and became an employee and realized it wasn't a place for a young enthusiast as such as myself
good,"High turnover rate, understaffed, poor higher management during my time there. The other officers were good, and some would bend over backwards for the company however the company did not reward those people. Working security if your relief did not show up for work that day, that meant you did not get to go home, so if it calls for snow you could be trapped at work for days on end. The job was not hard, but for the years that I was there, a 40 hour work week was not the norm, 60 hour+ weeks were the norm due to the insane amount of understaffing for positions."
good,"I spent almost 10 years with NG in 4 different locations and as hard as I worked nothing changed. I volunteered countless hours supporting their employee resource groups and made significant changes but the culture is tainted and middle management is horrible. They cater to the 20 somethings and ignore their seasoned employees that still want to learn and grow and unless you're really good at playing ""the game"", you won't likely get very far."
good,"Fast paced and technically challenging work environment.  NG provided great training opportunities.  They would pay for most certifications as long as they reasonably pertained to your current job position and, you passed the exams and received your certification.  Provided the opportunity to work on a wide variety of hardware.  I enjoyed my time at NG because of all the reasons I just listed. Like myself, I believe the majority of Admins enjoy learning new skill sets and working on a large variety of equipment.  NG provided these opportunities."
good,I had interesting assignments here and enjoyed the actual work I did.  I feel undervalued.  Management had a poor understanding of my skill set and would assign other inexperienced engineers to tasks I excelled at.  I enjoyed learning new tools such as Qt and Mentor Xpedition but had to teach myself these and still meet tight schedules (which I did).  There are poor or non-existent training opportunities.
good,"The place has potential, the actual job can get pretty interesting; however, 3 out 5 employees are somehow related by blood or marital status, leaving those that are not, at a disadvantage when problems arise."
good,This company is too big to individually care about its employees.  Unfortunately you are just a number and the culture is hard to change. There are pockets of goodness but the structure is so large that no one can make a decision without multiple levels of approval.
good,"NGC will use you for what they need, then spit you out with no care in the world about where you land.  Their administrative systems are ridiculously complicated to the point that management doesn't even understand them."
good,"At times, hard working, value added employees are severely overworked while lack luster employees are allowed to be slackers. Hardest part was not having a work - life balance. While NGC promotes this, it varies by department / manager."
good,It use to be one of the best companies to work for but they lost most of their core values. Everyone worked as a team in the past and were eager to help that's not how they currently operate.
good,"Worth it until they lay you off, doesn't seem like a place to build a career.Decent benefits and competitive pay, decent internal structure. It's partially the nature of the industry for their flaws but they're fairly unapologetic about it."
good,"If you enjoy high level of stress and extremely demanding environments, this is the right place for you. If not, do not think about coming here. The culture here is somewhat toxic and very political,  but has gotten better over the past year. The 9/80 work schedule is the only thing that really helps with the work/life balance."
good,"I helped stand up the VITA Customer Care Center.  When NG came in, they moved the whole thing to southern VA, but I couldn't go due to school.  They were in no way forgiving over my back injury, so I've nothing nice to say about them."
good,Enjoyed the co-workers. Diversity in the work was enjoyable. Supporting the war fighter gave a sense of pride in what we were trying to accomplishment.
good,"I love working for Northrop Grumman. However, most of the work is contract work and once the contract ends Its not likely that employers are placed with other jobs in the company."
good,"grade c company to work for, nice people with no growth potential.  Great learning experience for learning Aerospace, and politics.  CEO is O.K. good company to learn"
good,"I worked at NG during the recession, so salary and benefits were extremely low. I’ve heard things have improved since then. The 9/80 schedule and paid OT is a huge perk."
good,"Overall, I've had a great experience with Northrop Grumman. The only downside is that they are constantly reorganizing, so upper management is always shifting."
good,good job secure bad management. This company has a really old school culture. This company lacks of management skills and career development. It could be better -
good,"Great Company.  However, there is lack of communication at times.  I have a great background in military vehicles.  The most enjoyable part of the job are the people you meet."
good,"- rotation culture so you never get stuck in the same job"
good,"Plenty of work for those who work.  Management expects more from the dependable, and forgets about the workers that don't produce.  Most enjoyable part was knowing that Americas training force used good quality vehicles."
good,The machinery designed and built at ng are truly unique.  Complex machinery are designed to work the first time.  The design cycles are long but seeing the designs working in the field is a great accomplishment.
good,"Its not a bad company to work for. However, it depends who you work in the company with, some people just think they are better then everybody. "
good,"Challenging work environment, lots of opportunity. long hours, room for growth. Easy to move within company. Poor communication from senior leadership within company down to lower levels."
good,"In by 5 am singing looking for aircraft parts, in and opening tool crib up for floor employees to obtain supplies and aircraft parts.Issuing out chemicals needed to work on aircraft. Then a 10 am break, and back to the crib till lunch break."
good,You can make an effort to do a good job but it doesn't pay off. There are too many overly paid slackers getting away with doing nothing so the company ends up depending on you to cover for them.
good,"Northrop Grumman was good for taking for the working people. They cut back on the vacation days. Removed sick days."
good,I worked in Jacksonville fl and we were basically contractors for the boeing company.  Management promised things and did not follow through a lot.  Other employees told me not to judge the company by this location.
good,"Exciting Aerospace programs to work on, but at the mercy of government funding.  Slow-paced due to large company with many bureaucratic systems in place."
good,"There are a lot of different work cultures here but the one that stands out the most is Pride. Everyone here takes pride in what they do, and for the most part there is a significant talent pool here. The downside to that comes when management fails to recognize the hard work and dedication of individuals. Eventually everyone ends up looking for another job, due to the lack of compensation and or recognition, that could lead to a promotion. I do enjoy the people here, for the most part everyone is friendly and respectful."
good,"NGAS is a good place to work, but the historical culture of fixing poor planning with mandatory overtime is a horrible mindset and extremely demotivating.  the tools are cumbersome to do the job, the networks and computing resources are way below acceptable for a company with the annual revenue.  leadership positions are not vetted appropriately."
good,Program was poorly managed and there was not an opportunity for advancement. The culture of the program I worked on was one of suspicion.  I did lear about government contracting.
good,"Good place to work, but no worklife balance. It is also a very competitive environment. It's very difficult to get recognized for your hard work unless you know the right people."
good,"Very old style of doing business, lot of waste - time, effort. Lack of joined up thinking, working in Silos. German team is outstanding but not given enough credit."
good,"The work easy enough,but company  company had a lot of issues with tooling and controlling production.A lot of that stemmed from local people so that would be on their Management team other than that and the fact then wanted to use Chicken Licken mechanics instead of real mechanics to cut cost, which cost aircraft damage, but they were OK."
good,"The job is great, the people are great but the position offers no upward mobility or new transferable skills. However the position pays well.... while it lasts."
good,Great place to work...Very fast paced and exciting environment.  Company offer great benefits and is very engaged with their employees.  Not a good place for someone who doesn't believe in pay for performance.
good,Overall Northrop is very much like any other large corporation.  If you find yourself on a good project with a good team it can be very rewarding.  Unfortunately there are many bad projects with mediocre employees that contribute to a poor culture overall.
good,"Northrop pays well and has good benefits, but know what you're getting into. This company does not value its employees. If you can tolerate that and look out for yourself, then it can be help your career. The opportunity to work on a wide variety of technologies can be fulfilling."
good,"Working here is very challenging sometimes. The hours are long, you work most weekends and if you have a family they must be willing to sacrifice a lot in order for you to"
good,Company needs to become more familiar with the individuals workloads and acknowledge good performance.  Communication lacks.  A lot of changes in management.
good,"It is my belief that while Northrop Grumman was in a joint venture with Newport News Shipbuilding, the culture was in flux and did not fully take on any aspect that would have changed the Shipyard's culture in a positive way. My experience there was not very professional and was not managed very well. This endeavor has left me wondering what would have happened if Northrop Grumman had remained involved with Newport News Shipbuilding? Would it have made a difference and changed the culture of the Shipyard in a way that would eliminate the negative image that haunts them today? On a brighter note, I don't really know what it would be like to work for Northrop Grumman however, you never know what can happen. When one door closes another door opens."
good,I support a very small team of technical writers and testers.  We sit together daily and communicate all day discussing work issues.  The atmosphere is extremely present.  I am not only a supervisor but a key contributor.  The hardest part of my job is delivering unpleasant reviews or terminations to staff because of budget cuts.  I enjoy the team and the team atmosphere.  It is a pleasure to come to work with seasoned professionals who love their job.
good,"The company is evolving.  In the last 5-7 years there has been a great deal of change organizationally.  The management structure is constantly in flux.  There are many efforts regarding Engagement and Inclusion that despite concerted, very focused attention by management don't seem to have much traction.   The great thing about working at this company is that despite the uncertain environment and distrust of a management, employees are dedicated  and committed to the mission."
good,"The job was easy to do, I got along with the other officers that I did work with. People were very friendly when entering and exiting the buildings, I learned a lot from that job that has allowed to continue to improve myself."
good,Northrop provides great compensation and job security but the culture has declined over the years. A lack of accountability and potential for advancement have become discouraging.
good,"I enjoy working with the people around me. I have had the pleasure to work for great managers and I have had horrible managers. About every 2 years the word layoff pops up. Even if you survive every layoff, a layoff environment can be a stressful place to work."
good,"It's an easy place to work at, not to much pressure to produce as long as quality is good. Management has no experience on shop floor and it shows."
good,"No supportive Management.  Northrop Grumman is the parent Company of the company I am reviewing, so review does not apply to Northrop Grumman."
good,"Typical day is a fire at a moment's notice and funding is unavailable.  Always trying to stay ahead of the game without burning out quick.  The people are always willing to help, but sometimes it is management that does not see the big picture until it is too late.  I enjoy my job when I am able to be productive and given room to move forward without too many hiccups in the day."
good,"Great company but many managers of retirement age will not retire making growth difficult.  Great work-life balance, never have to take your work home with you."
good,There is room for advancement but it may take a long time to get there and you definitely have to prove yourself by always going above and beyond. Depending on what contract you are assigned days can be long and stressful with high demand from leadership.
good,Company was having many issues as far as ensuring no recurring problems would happen with the product. Management was new and did a good job as far as upper management very militarily way of thinking. They ask people to work 12 hour days 5-6 days a week and talks of making it 7 days a week where prevalent.
good,"NG is an ethical company with strict standards. They provide a lot of opportunities for growth, and they treat their employees well."
good,"Azusa plant will be closing soon, lots of cutbacks in funding - near impossible to do what role fits you best."
good,Was a good company until Northrop Grumman slowly dismantled us.
good,Good place to work. Getting worse as the years go by. Reducing benefits yearly.
good,"What used to be a great company with a proud heritage is being run into the ground by a bunch of Educational Elitists that value a degrees degrees degrees over practical Experience. Most management that had any valuable practical experience has long ago retired or recently taken the V-Rif. The few good managers that are left see the writing on the walls and are hoping to get out soon. "
good,Not for everyone. Ability to work from home is great balance.
good,"Northrop Grumman has wonderful benefits and I was paid a great salary.  However, some benefits, such as off-site training opportunities and time off for appointments, were not available for consultants.  "
good,Co-workers are terrific and very professional.  Great company to work for although all the sectors are drastically different.
good,Came in machined parts for various ships and submarines to support deployment responsibilities.
good,"I've been at Northrop Grumman for almost 20 years. I've worked on many interesting projects. If you like the the technology the US military uses, you might like Northrop Grumman. Northrop Grumman is a hard company to review. Since it is so large, there is no way anybody could understand all of its locations and culture."
good,"Like other ratings I've given employers, it's not what it seems. I loved Northrop Grumman. (I still do). I worked for NG in Baghdad, so some ratings are understandably low and do not fairly scale in terms of what normal working conditions are like. I would happily go back to NG if the opportunity ever presented itself and I highly encourage anyone seeking employment with them to do the best they can on their interviews."
good,"•	Facilitated the use of various NAVY financial database systems as well as other systems/ programs to enter and extract data, as well as to prepare the reconciliation of various NAVY contracts."
good,"Program Manager leading engineering and operations activities in a high technical environment.  Great co-workers, committed to doing a good job and company values.  Limited support from senior management."
good,"Significant cost cutting has been done over the last two years.  That has saved some programs but has also cut salaries, bonuses, and the tools we work with to do our jobs.  Northrop lacks any good rotation programs for the engineers or for any good MBAs that could turn around an old culture.  Management is overpaid and you just get in line with everyone else for a promotion which only comes once you are at the high end of their experience charts."
good,Management tells you that you cannot advance without degrees.  You obtain higher degrees than the person that told you that you cannot advance and then they still do not let you advance.
good,I love my job.  I love solving problems for clients.  Everyday as a DBA is different which is wonderful.  It is a job that I get to continually grow my skills and learn in.   I would love to be able to work remotely doing Oracle DBA work since it is not necessary to be onsite anymore to perform job duties.
good,"I have learned that as in most jobs networking is key. More so at NG in Aurora. I saw many individuals who were well qualified or over qualified for open positions on projects be passed over for personal friends of management at all levels. In almost all these cases the ""friend"" in need of a position had little to no experience related to the position they were filling. This had obvious effects on the rest of the team moral and project performance. This occurred many times on multiple projects, as well as to myself personally. "
good,I have enjoyed working with the employees and making sure they are taken care of.  The employees I deal with are working overseas and I like them to focus on their work.  The company has allowed me to do that.
good,"NGC is a fine place to work. The hours and expectations can be intense, but thats true in most industries. There really isnt much of a work life balance. You start at 6am and are supposed to get every other friday off. But it is often expected that you will work. NGC also just erased 2 holidays from NGCs 10 day holiday schedule."
good,"Excellent place to work if you have willingness to move"
good,"Management has changed from you are a talented manager, manage the business like it was your own to do what I say, how I say, when I say.  I have spoken to several peers and the company has deferred from taking care of it's employees to taking care of themselves and their bonuses."
good,"Lots of projects,  can be a bit unstable. Increases have been horrible."
good,"I joined the Northrop Grumman corporation from late 2006 to 2010 as a migration engineer I used Quest migration software for active directory migration of directory services and objects from the local state agency's domain to a collapsed consolidated target domain for the Commonwealth of Virginia.  In that role I had to address numerous IT disciplines such as  understanding group policy, terminal services management, security and distribution group management, sid history, Windows server roles, Exchange system manager, the Windows registry, login scripts and more."
good,"I learn how to be more managerial, network analysis, and troubleshooting"
good,Northrop Grumman is a large company with great benefits.  Working for a defense contractor is a big source of pride for me as I feel a part of helping in the defense our great nation. Along the same lines because the company is a defense contractor our security prevents some great and innovative communications initiatives.
good,"My daily work schedule consist of meeting with team on daily task and schedule. In addition, I meet with cross function groups to discuss new product development or updates to the current products that my program currently are working on. Next, I will work on documentation such as Test Plan and Requirements and/or Requirement Baseline. Finally, I will write test cases or run daily automation builds and discuss with the team if any issues have occur with testing of any products. For instance, if any bugs, errors, or issues have been found and report the issue to the proper individual or group."
good,"The flexibility of 9/80 schedule coupled with ""get your work done by the deadline whenever/however you do it"" and the friendly working environment are the best parts of the job. Budget issues and looming sequestration made advancement opportunities and raises virtually non-existent (or only available to those who know someone or simply get lucky). The number of PTO days differs by sector but for IS it's 15 days which includes holidays and any time you take as sick/personal time. The hardest part of the job is seeing inefficiency and waste everywhere yet knowing that your efforts can't change anything other than burn you out. The work itself is meaningful and interesting but the working environment has been getting increasingly more frustrating."
good,"Great people, little to no room to advance.  Someone has to die or retire.  Struggle with winning new business."
good,"Co Workers are great.  Engagement with customers is top notch.  Customer satisfaction is outstanding.  Training opportunties are available with support of management.  "
good,"Typically the type of work that is offered is challenging and the compensation is comparable with other aerospace companies. Program-level management is usually aware of your productivity, however, functional management (manager who is responsible for your review, professional growth, training) is too far removed from the program and is not aware of your day-to-day performance. In my opinion, to save cost, the company is undergoing a youth movement, so if your are a senior engineer with a great deal of experience, considered yourself as being warned."
good,Manageament getting harder to deal with. Co- workers a good nothing stays the same there everyday you have to do something new
good,"HR and leadership does not compensate based on performance, rather based on only years of service"
good,"Decline of the defense industry has made job security an issue and given reductions management is more focused on self preservation. Little to no work life balance, you belong to the company 24x7. "
good,"High technology, high security, a culture of government contracts and diverse employees, both union and professional."
good,"Typical day was going to customer sites to work on computer problems. I learned a lot about different equipment. Management was there when we needed them, and my co-workers were great guys. Hardest part of the job was the commute. Most enjoyable part was when I gave back the computer to the customer with the problem remedied."
good,"northrop was a good place to work. bad thing is no onereally advanced there. got to learn many new thing such as applly LO material and panel work. stayed busy all day, which I liked made the day go by fast."
good,"Not much room for advancement within the department, unless you know somebody. Every decision is driven by budget concerns. Management can't train you to do your job because there is zero ""training budget"". So you end up working odd jobs for weeks at a time. Some have worked in the position for years and don't have training on all machines."
good,"meet up with foreman get assignment for the day, go to cable rack and find the cables that foreman told me to run. go aboard ship to areas specified on tso sheet and run cables to the points. I learned how to navigate my way around a ship, how to hook-up some electrical devices. management was spotty some were very knowledgeable and others had positions because of who they knew instead of what they knew. at times when a question about how to do something was brought to some foremen they didn't know how to do the task in question. co-workers ranged just because of the amount of co-workers that were there some of the older co-workers didn't like the apprentice program and they took it out on the apprentices but for the most part everyone was friendly and helpful. the crew that I worked with was like a family they had known each other for years and they welcomed anyone new in with open arms. I created relationships that will last forever. the hardest part of the job was at times there were multiple crafts trying to work in the same area and it would be difficult to get daily tasks accomplished. the most enjoyable part was days when we had to pull big cables and they called on our crew. they put our crew together with guys that did all the heavy-lifting thinking that they would get the apprentices to quit because of the ""hard-work"" but those were the times when we did our best work because we got to work together as a team. we had fun while we worked but we always worked safe and with a gameplan that always got the job done."
good,"If you like having access to any tool/software under the sun, but not being able to use them to capabilities that were acceptable 2 decades ago, then this place is for you. Getting an answer quickly far outweighs ensuring the answer is the correct one."
good,Worked as a liasion engineer and MRB certified to sign off on repair drawings.
good,"Great place to work however when working onsite with customer and not in a corporate office, you are extremely isolated with no room for advancement . If contract expires, you are let go, no transfers or job placement assistance within company."
good,We supported a difficult client
good,"Family like culture. People are friend. In manufacturing site, even managers are not educated. They started at the shop floor. Raise is low."
good,as en employer fair. sometimes fun place to work. if you enjoy constant change this is the place to work.
good,"I have enjoyed my 16 yrs with NG. I have had 4 different positions within the company. I have worked in Security doing background checks and finger ptinting, mail services delivering mail, employee services running the employee store and doing all banking and accounting, and then of course payroll."
good,Over all great company to get with. They have a lot of contracts to offer many positions and movement if you so desire.
good,Limited time there not as an employee. Different view on how the company is. For the most part everything is fine and is dependent on the individual working there. It's a good option overall.
good,Working for them was fine. Expected to go to work on time everyday and do your job at a timely manner and accurately.....pay was decent and average for industry standard .
good,"Been with NG for almost 5 year. I'm not impressed with their management style. Working on a customer site, you're very disconnected from headquarters, so have the time you don't know what's going on the company."
good,"they are a no nonsense company, they were always about the business at hand, they provided support if any employee gave you a hard time. you had opportunity to learn on the job."
good,"Ok company lots of chiefs tons of overtime, and weekend work. Not a lot of support from upper management as far as training classes to do your day to day job"
good,Do not want to add comments. This is not a section i chose to populate. I will not be writing about Grumman. I decline this section and do not want to give this information.
good,"●	Upgraded systems to 2016."
good,In my time there I had two managers.  My first manager was very good and a dream to work for.  My second manager was remote and not effective in the least.
good,"The office is no longer the center of the universe. In today's connected world, more employees are doing work ""out there"" – either face-to-face with customers, in far-flung locations or simply in their pajamas."
good,Glad to work and get experience.  Really helped to further my education and professional experience. I would recommend this company for any new aspiring engineers.
good,"I liked the work, the people, and the pay wasn't bad. I didn't care for the overarching feel that I was always being watched though. There seemed to be a new rule every week changing how I had to do my work but any ideas I had about how things might have been made better were met with indifference or just ignored. "
good,"Northrop Grumman is a leading global security company providing innovative systems, products and solutions in autonomous systems, cyber, C4ISR, space, strike, and logistics and modernization to customers worldwide."
good,"Generally impressed by the intellect and level of professionalism exhibited by colleagues across the company but discouraged by the siloed, hierarchical corporate structure of the company and leery of the imbalanced distribution of opportunities for promotion and career development."
good,Job is flexible but management is old school and there are little opportunities for advancement at this location. Other locations have much more opportunities for advancement.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job are the people that I worked with. The work is not as interesting as jobs I have had in the past but I believe that depends on the location.
good,"At Northrop Grumman, we take a holistic approach to cybersecurity, looking at the whole cyber landscape of people, processes and technology and the whole security realm of offense, defense, and exploitation. Thought leadership demands nothing less. Join the Northrop Grumman team as we provide legendary program support to advanced, secure, and agile systems and solutions."
good,If you need a job working for the government as a contractor that gets paid well Northrop Grumman is decent. I did not work out of the company I worked in a government facility that was a secret compartment information container.
good,Decent workplace. Typical nine-to-five grind with very little room for growth or advancement. Could not see myself there for very long. But definitely a very steady and tranquil work environment.
good,NG is a well structured company but lapses in upper management over time have caused severe supply and production problems.                                          ---------------------------
good,Northrop Grumman was overall a great company to work for with opportunities to try different jobs over time.  They had opportunities for advancement available.
good,"I have no complaints about pay or benefits. There is plenty of OT to work. "
good,"I worked for NG for over 8 years. Began my career with TASC and NGIT. Loved it! "
good,The company is satisfactory to me altho i was offered the job and got an offer letter it took to long to bring me on board. The benefits were not all that great. Most off all the people were good.
good,It's a job and that's about it - it pays the bills but the work is less than desirable - pay is mediocre at best and new hires are able to move up the ladder fast.
good,"Good place to work, decent benefits and 401 plan. Good culture at remote sites. Volunteerism is big with this company. Management can be a challenge,,"
good,NGC is a very stable and great company to work for.  It is a world wide company with lots of options for individuals that are looking to expand their job portfolio.
good,"I have been a contractor at Northrop Grumman for the last 3 months, and I have done some design work on the ACS program as well as ARRW program where I had to choose the right adhesive for a jointed component."
good,"Northrop Grumman is a comfortable place to work, and I mean that in both good and bad ways. It pays decently well, the jobs are moderately interesting, and the benefits and perks are okay. Unfortunately, the company's culture among its employees revolves around comfort rather than purpose. Even though the projects are cutting edge, the management does not instill purpose or vision; rather, they encourage contentment over drive. In my own experience, it seems that they do not reward those who do their jobs exceptionally and encourage employees to stay within the boundaries of their bureaucracy."
good,Northrop Grumman offers a place to grow your strengths and refine your weaknesses.  It is a family like environment.  The projects are exciting and the project managers care for their people.
good,"a typical day of work, Not enough pay, no career advancement, not willing to produce advancement. Need better pay and better management. A busy place."
good,Was only there for nine months. Don't really have much more to say. That was about six years ago. The cafeteria was nice and the free coffee was good too.
good,A typical day at work  include writing code and maintaining systems. I learned how to write XML code to build spreadsheet for the purpose of downloading reports
good,Good people bad work environment. Leadership needed to develop people skills and learn to effectively communicate better. Seemed to be favoritism on many levels.
good,"I can not talk about my job at Northrop Grumman ."
good,On a typical day I was responsible for maintaining and producing quality product on my machine. I ordered parts and controlled flow between departments.
good,Checking status of servers and system backups. Research better ways to improve performance and less downtime for customers. Attend staff meeting for updates outstanding trouble tickets nad company requirements.
good,What you would expect from a big contractor company. Can be fun an challenging place to work depending on the contract. i believe this is on par for all contractors in the industry.
good,"The workload was engaging, but the leadership and mentors were not. The hardest part about working here was not getting the guidance I was looking for as an intern."
good,I was not working here for very long since the position was soon eliminated due to budget cuts.  I did find the work interesting however the technology used was a bit outdated.
good,The work environment was positive for the most part but the salary was not competitive. For what was asked of me and the various responsibilities I had it was more advantageous economically for me to seek employment elsewhere.
good,"Too many layers of management.  Employees were treated with deference, contractors not so much.  I was not allowed to perform tasks at which I excel.  Less experienced staff were given tasking for which they sought my assistance."
good,"At the time that I was employed, there wasn't much work to do at all. They were in limbo waiting on securing bids so we were all scrambling daily to find work."
good,"I love the work and the people I worked with...challenging, mission first mentality...working with the military helps keep me up to date with the skills I need for my military war frighting function"
good,great place to work good people great opp but have to explore other opporitunities and see what is out there to start a new career thanks for everything
good,"Started out a great job and then when management changed it got worse with how they view there employees in certain departments. "
good,its a good company to work for if you are in a high paying job but if you are on the production operator aspect it gets stressful. The number one thing that I would have to complain about is the lack of training that new people receive
good,Northrop Grumman is a great company for people who are looking to learn and make things happen. Majority of the population is close to retirement and always willing to share their experience. The 9/80 schedule is awesome for work life balance.
good,Good fair reasonable benefits health dental vision life insurance logistics trucks trains planes boats warehouse workers forklift drivers planners workers logistics
good,"Passionate employees and great product mix, needs more engaged executive team.  A lot of change over the past 3 years and the trend appears to be continuing."
good,Good place to start. Not much else after that. Upper management don't get involve much to help employee get the right assignment that fit their skill set.
good,Interesting work shared with like minded military professionals that was rewarding but sometimes frustrating due to changing conditions once the exercises started. Lack of progressive compensation was definitely a dissatisfier.
good,"Didn't like management, it was a very stressful work environment. They can do a better job to make employees happy. Sometimes work-life balance is not good."
good,Overall it's a good place to start a career in aviation. The people and mgt there are courteous and helpful. The work schedule there is 4 10's and overtime if needed.
good,"Working with them was pleasant but very hard to advance this job is a range worker which requires alot of physical labor,  but part time work only for none a or b techs"
good,"nice place to work, start the day off with job forecast on job assignments, always safety meetings and quality meetings shop cleanliness, people helping people,"
good,Good company to work for with lots of opportunity for advancement and mentoring.  Very large company which does give you the ability to move just about anywhere.
good,"Northrop is a solid company to work for.  There are the usual big company problems (ie. you're just a number), but when you get down to the team you work on and the people you see every day you can feel start to feel at home."
good,The people and atmosphere are generally positive. Most people are easy-going. Everyone wants to get the job done the right way and do so in their own way.
good,"The operators where great"
good,"During my tenure at Northrop Grumman, I was paid the market average but had really good benefits. The manager at this project was a micro manager and allowed for very little autonomy. Overall, I'd give the company a 3-star rating."
good,"Good ones are guilt free, bad ones are not and they know it. But some bad ones think they are good so you have to make the decision."
good,Nice place to work with flexible hours. They have a decent PTO schedule. Managers are very nice. Great company to work for if you are into engineering and aerospace.
good,"Laid off twice, first time no assistance was given. Second time was an improvement. However, at some point they decided to save money and dropped clearance maintenance to save money. But in reality, no one could get a job in another location......"
good,Poor management and not a lot of room for growth from some job positions like admin. Even when you bust your behind to get a degree. Good pay and benefits.
good,"Typical government contractor that lags behind in the benefits required from today's employees.   No ability to work from home, flex time etc., company needs to adapt."
good,the jobe was clean easy nice hard pay well not enough pay many people too many persons not enough breaks too long of luches ten hour days with three day weekends
good,"Great people and expirances, bad culture. The employees cared for each other and the misson. To many leadership restructures. Leadership put to much pesure on job and left no room for personal life."
good,"Many positives and some negatives typical of a large defense contractor.  Job experience varies from program to program and site to site.  The company has strong management and fair compensation.  However, job enjoyment can vary depending on what program you work on."
good,I enjoyed the people I worked with everyday.  We really had a home away from home environment. The culture at this company is very diverse and inclusive.
good,"It's a factory floor. The idea of building aircraft starts out cool, but working on a factory floor gets pretty bland on a daily basis. They were very strict on time. If you came in even a minute late, they will know and you will get in trouble. There is a ""strike"" system, but it is very short and stern. The hours were a bit of a stretch, with a full work day being twelve hours starting very early and ending in the late afternoon. You walk in early in the morning, clock in, and start work. There are breaks, including over an hour for lunch, in which you are almost completely free to do as you please as long as you're back to work before break is over and do not break company policy. Management was very helpful. These are people who will do whatever they can to help you get what you need. The workplace culture varies by site location."
good,"A lot of good and smart people work there.  The project are large and you can feel somewhat isolated and unimportant, and detached from your tangible work products.  If you want a decent salary, fight for it from the start.. stingy with raising your salary to competitive level."
good,"Under appropriate guidance and teamwork, this would have been a fulfilling experience. There was virtually no communication at all levels. Products were ill defined."
good,"NGST had the most flexible hours you can imagine, and great benefits.  The company has a nice big campus and the teams are well organized.  I enjoyed my time there."
good,Great company to work for! Encourages employees to advance their education and work towards receiving certificates. Has a set work shift for individual unless there is a change in the business need.
good,Good work day hours. management was not that good micro managed. workplace culture was good. The job was not hard everything flowed smoothly. enjoyable part of job was working with great people who cared.
good,NGAS is going through a management overhaul some of the folks are quite good some not so much. I felt I was discriminated against because of my age by my boss.
good,"Depending on which contract you are working on, and which location, your experiences may vary. Company has good benefits / opportunities for advancement."
good,"Limited flexibility is given within the organization.  Corporate Culture is mediocre.  The company offers competitive wages, however, overall benefits could be improved."
good,"Fast Paced, can be very stressful, great company, many locations to work. I would recommend Northrop Grumman to anyone. Working for the Department of Defense can be very difficult at times but also supporting the warfighter is rewarding."
good,"gotta stay on your feet most of the day tough gig can be stressful"
good,"The Company provided online training, which helped in advancing in career. The Company also provided Tuition Assistance if you wished to pursue a certificate or field of study to advance in your career."
good,"As a government contractor, NGC is a very detail oriented place to work where you're rewarded for following the process and moving slowly, but surely towards goals and benchmarks set for you."
good,"Poor management, lack of advancement and no sick leave. Long hours that lead to little down time with family. had to use PTO to cover days when the company we were contracting for was closed."
good,This was an ACS contract and was not run with the employee's health care in mind.  The new company ran the contract worse than Northrop Grumman so it seems like this contract attracts the same type of employer.
good,"toughest job to date. learned a lot. Also worked with some not-so friendly management. Learned time management and multitasking. Long drive from home, so commute was rough. Ended up being ""sequestered"" a few years back. Lessons learned."
good,Plenty off work.  Little time off.  Schedulers are home-roomed but provide direct support to various projects.  The home-room manager doesn't have an appreciation for the support the scheduler provides.
good,Felt as though manager was not completely honest nor did they all encourage the work/life balance. The culture of the project was horrible. Too many excuses and finger pointing.
good,Don't remember much it was 15 years ago... It is your typical large defense contractor.  large projects that move slow. security clearance needed.  it pays the bills
good,"Interesting work, but no job security.  This was a good job, with work that was not too difficult, but planning could be better. Other than the project, the company is very interesting, does a variety of types of software."
good,"Work schedule is 8-9-8; every-other-Friday off."
good,"Feels good to make a difference, but exceptional work can go unnoticed. Very established 'good ol' boy' network.  If you aren't in the tight knit group, you get left out.  When time for a layoff, merit means little, the network protects itself."
good,A typical day was completing tickets in an AGILE software process environment. The rub came during review time when management seemed powerless to treat it's employees fairly.
good,Northrup Grumman is a growing company that has absorbed other companies and because of that sometimes positions are duplicated and then people are let go.
good,Good place to work.  Great technical mentoring opportunities...Great benefits.  Access to good technology resources.  Would recommend to a friend.  Low stress working environment.
good,"Provided support for all computer related issues. From imaging new workstations, to supporting software bugs within specific programs. Company provides good benefits."
good,"I like NG but I am being passed over for job positions and I want to advanced. I feel there are favorites and I don think that is fair."
good,"Northrop was a not a fun place to work because the company culture does not match jobs close to employees' desired location, such as residential. Also pay is usually low, whereas work hours are much longer than expected."
good,"As with any large company, there was a lot of focus on process and bureaucracy.  This environment can be frustrating for lower level engineers who are more interested in technology."
good,"Northop Grumman was on par with other government contractors. There were few opportunities to move outside of your position. It was not a terrible company, just not one for people looking to advance."
good,"Being in a high level job position, producing Logistics documents and managing Logistics Engineers, I worked continuously during the day to produce credible and accurate Logistics plans until completion.  The team worked well together in completing all tasks assigned.  The hardest part of the job was the accumulation of source data needed to produce Logistics plans that would be used to validate/verify effective supportability plans for the military."
good,"Working at Northrop Grumman has it's ups and downs.  On one hand they have good pay and benefits.  On the other hand, it is a large company that will grind you up and spit your out."
good,"A culture of continuation.  Incredible job security with long established projects that require years of support.  Planned advancement based on longevity with the company, not necessarily by merit.  Not competitive pay."
good,"Expect a typical defense contractor with great people wanting to make a difference, but lots of bureaucracy and difficulties making anything significant happen quickly."
good,I did not know I Offttened  someone in HR. I had gotten sick and wanted to return to work. That person would not allow me to return to work. So manager Made me sign a letter of probration for One year.
good,Good company with ability to take on new positions in different areas and allow for a more wide experience base.  Company is financially sounds and will be around for quite some time.
good,This was a great place to work if you could tolerate unqualified people getting ahead because of who they knew.  There were people hired that did not meet the requirements.
good,Lots of job opportunities and job growth for entry level to mid-level employees.  Senior level positions and career opportunities become more limited.
good,A large company with all of the pros and cons that go with a large company. Bought the smaller company that I worked for and changed the culture for the worse.
good,"I found the options available to be limited to positions that had little work to do and little guidance on how to handle that. Additionally, compensation and benefits were a bit low compared to other federal contractors."
good,Very large company that has vast amount of resources. Naturally with a larger company you will only really be close to your direct reports and managers.
good,"A fast-paced but good environment full of good people and opportunities. Management and I didn't get along, but the people who I worked with were fine and enjoyable."
good,"The coworkers are nice and helpful, but overall communication on expectations within the work environment are non-existent. Manager would approve something then get mad the next week over it."
good,"NG is a GREAT company to work for with excellent benefits!, However, the particular contract I was on was poorly managed and no one care anymore.  It's a shame what was going on."
good,"Overall, I good place to work and learn at the same time.  The environment was relaxed and promoted cohesive teamwork.  The managers and supervisors were very helpful and willing to set their subordinates up for success."
good,"The people are great, but the company culture still has an old school mentality.  Management is overworked and they lack people leadership skills and training.  The work can be tactical and less strategy driven.  Overall, it's a good place to work, with good benefits.  The work can be dull, and it's very bureaucratic. ."
good,"Manager transferred from another site to be our manager but was more focused on his own advancement than those he managed.  We worked panama shifts, 2/2/3. Alternating days off. Every other weekend was a three day weekend, which was nice but the shifts were all 12+ hours.  If you like jobs in SCIF's, then it's great - no windows, lots of locked doors, if you were lucky you could watch the News when nothing was going on."
good,The most stressful part of the job is waiting on the customer to make decisions. The most enjoyable part of the job is the flexibility to work remote  as needed.
good,Self motivation is needed to exceed.  Not much interaction. You are given the tools necessary to accomplish your task   Environment can be routine. Stay focus on the task at hand.
good,"a typical day at work involved systems engineering designing."
good,"north rop Grumman is a good company that i was-very happy to join , but sadly our management has changed most managers , new management is not that motivating"
good,"Northrop Grumman is a good company with many young engineers on their staff.  Their future looks pretty bright and promising for new talent.  They have a good rotational program, for those who wish to get involved."
good,"It's an okay place to work, but level of effort required is inconsistent. Either super busy or nothing to do.  Also management communication is very poor."
good,"The company is a great company to work for.  It has many benefits such as training, insurance, & great salaries."
good,Good company to work for.  Good management for the most part.  not a lot of advancement opps.  Steady employment that will likely continue in the foreseeable future.
good,It was a great job with excellent benefits.  Typical day was working as a team to get the job done. the hardest part of the job was working 7 days and 12 hours.
good,"Typical shipyard environment.   There was a time where it was part of the good ole boy system but since Ingalls took back over, I have heard it has changed quite a bit"
good,The company is an average place to work. Management is  disconnected with what it takes to get the job done.  The job in a warehouse does not pay very well.  The work week was Monday-Friday.
good,"A typical day at work for me was to come into work with a positive attitude to get my job done."
good,"This only applies to the office in Aurora, Colorado as of 2011. But as I was there, it seemed to transition from a small-ish company doing interesting defense research towards a cog in a large company mostly responsible for maintenance. They still seek out and win new development contracts, but had huge management overhead and the research side was shrinking rapidly by the time I left."
good,"A typical day consists of busy work and meetings."
good,"NGC has a culture steeped in personnel being shipped from program to program,based on availability, seniority, and who you know. Tribal knowledge is HUGE,and the learning curve can be steep if you don't hit the ground running."
good,Well established company.  Reviewed work with care and efficiency.  No very friendly with workers.  Not a lot to improve moral.  Main focus is to make money.
good,This was a fun place to work. Learned a lot and was challenged in my role. Helped in others departments when needed without expecting anything in return.
good,"Professional work environment, knowledgeable and friendly people. The pay is OK. I was laid-off during a company downsizing phase. You'd after 23 years of service their would be some loyalty.  I've been applying to get back there since 2007.  I ended up handing over 3 different work packages over to 3 different college grads.  Before, they would give you a 2 month notice for lay off.  Now it's 2 weeks."
good,Challenging and stimulating. Work is varied and satisfactory. Professional environments.  Able to work with minimal supervision. Flexible working hours in most cases.
good,NGC has seen its best days.  It has a difficult time shifting away from exclusive defense projects.  The senior management is highly dependent on a revolving door from Government. An effort to diversify internationally has not taken hold.
good,The work flow is steady. There isn't much room for advancement even if you have higher education. All of the people are nice and easy to get along with. Some of the managers are incompetent and don't seem to care about doing a good job or employee opinions.
good,"Job security is good and opportunities to move around, within the company, in some sectors but the work/life balance isn't that great depending upon your program."
good,Grumman used to be a very good company to work for lately New Management transitioning from California to Florida the management really does show appreciation to the employees
good,I already reviewed this company. This program will not allow me to pass up this part of the process of applying for a job. And I already did it once.
good,"Many opportunities to advance and opportunities to move onto new work in varying fields."
good,Good place to work.  Great people. Cutting edge work dealing with defense industry.  Many locations in the  US and overseas.
good,I came into the shipyard while they were under Northrup Grumman.  There were a lot of changes negative/positive after they left.
good,"Good people, Good work conditions,  Seems to be somewhat disfunctional at the upper Mgt. level. Otherwise, great place to work."
good,"Under NG I was well taken of as an employee. As a sub, not so much, but not a reflection on NG."
good,I really loved working at Northrop Grumman and the people there were great. I truly wish there would have been more opportunity to become a permanent employee while I worked there. The uncertainty of doing contract work was always a concern.
good,They lack the ability to properly train employees. They tend to look too much at your title and pay to determine if you can do a job vs. the actual talent. This company as a lot of work to do internally.
good,Great place to work lots of opportunities great employee support meet lots of great coworkers pay is good work schedule is great
good,I worked with a great team designing instructions manuals for the aircraft carriers. I did the auto cad drawing and help created the wiring diagrams for the carriers.
good,"A top engineering company that is riddled with chutes and ladders, which constantly hinder the freeflow of your work.  Management typical has no clue what is going on with their own employees, with the exception of a few that understand being a manager is more than just a seat that needs filled.  Most engineers are easy going and will be open to talk to you about their work.  The most enjoyable part of this job is the ability to work on many different designs ranging from simple to complex."
good,"New contract, not organized"
good,"9 hours shifts lots of coffee, working in dimly lit places"
good,Northrop is a great place for the young and enthusiastic engineers to develop their career.  It is high in technology and a leader in the defense industry.
good,I enjoyed the work and it was a great experience. I enjoyed working on the projects. Would  like to do this type of work again someday.
good,Great opportunity to work with soldiers and training them for future operations. Ability to cross train and share knowledge and expertise with one another.
good,The IT desktop support team was outsourced to NG (Northrop Grumman) and was eventually outsourced to CSC. Maintained all of the same job duties and responsibilities.
good,With this company you will have the opportunity to work on many exciting projects that will be very rewarding. Compensation and advancement are limited.
good,"Great place to cut your teeth on for experience but there wasn't any true job security or advancement in place unless one was part of the good ole boys team. Buddy system was totally in play and the best mangers moved on or to another company quickly. Even though this is a huge company with Federal and Civilian contracts, the pay was not huge, so don't expect it unless one got the position through cronies."
good,Good decent pay if you get in and they hire you.  Managers don't care about complaints or issues they basically tell you to work it out among your co workers or your fired.  Do something wrong most of the time either get fired or write up.  ACS position until Omniplex World Services took over the contract at NSA.
good,"Typical of a DOD contracting culture, NG is more concerned about the customer than the employees it markets to the government."
good,Good company with positive working environment.  Encourage life balance.  Large company with opportunities all over the country.  Access to on-line training to improve skills.
good,"It is a very good company to work for. They are more than fair with salary,opportunties, and career growth.They have openings worldwide."
good,Ok place work you will learn a lot of machines that are great to put on your resume. First couple of day will be rough because there is so much to learn but once you grasp it eveything will be easy
good,"The people were a pleasure to work with, local management was not. Company lost the contract due to poor management.The  company was a great company to work for, good benefits and wages."
good,"NG is okay to work for.  Their so big, you really don't matter to them.  And best of luck getting a raise.  Employees who dedicated their life to the company may get 5% each year.  Don't expect any upward mobility."
good,Northrop Grumman was bought out by Huntington Ingalls.  the same work environment and management styles. I learned a lot from this company and i enjoyed the people who i worked with the best
good,"professional environment work."
good,It has been an ok place to work. Overall friendly people willing to help adjust to new locations. Would recommend if you are looking for a job.
good,"1. Typical day would be full of different task and it was a great multitasking job. "
good,"I managed all the classified networks, keep all systems up to date"
good,Good place to work day to day. Learned a lot. In certain areas can't go out to lunch because of warehouse traffic. Not enough personnel to help in the warehouse. Pay raises only to FAVORED employees
good,"It's ok, but it is time for change. I have been here for 10 years and I am willing to learn something new and  take on new task."
good,The work was intense and always a new learning experience. There was plenty of projects to work on and always new systems being built.
good,A good work experience while adding new knowledge to my craft.  Met some good people along the way that I still stay in touch with.
good,Most management within the company is very approachable with an open door policy. It is an environment with great learning opportunities and co-workers that can feel like family.
good,Northrop Grumman is a large company which supports the US military needs. In an economy in which the award of contracts to defense contractors is less frequent and more competitive it is more difficult to advance in the company. Employees are dedicated to supporting the US military. Employees are reminded on a daily basis of who we support by the displays which identify who we support. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with people who believe in the supporting the military needs of our country.
good,"As a contracts administrator, hard to define a typical day at work.  But as a part of my job duties, I negotiated agreements, led proposal efforts, sent correspondence, served as the company's primary point of contact with customers, and completed special projects as needed.  Management generally supportive but can do more to place employees at risk of losing coverage.  Hardest part of the job was dealing with other business management units.  Most enjoyable part of the job was delivering customer service."
good,"Fun place to work, lots of overtime during the holiday season!"
good,"During the 18 months I was on this job prior to being laid off, I was a contractor supporting the Federal Aviation Administration worked in the facilities organization which was responsible for the renovation or modernization of air traffic control towers throughout the country.  I learned more about project management, the importance of budget and project funding.  The coworkers at Northrop Grumman were great, always supporting one another and willing to assist where needed.  The government client with the FAA felt like were not always supportive of the support contractors.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with the issues which arose while managing the construction of the air traffic control towers.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the internal camaraderie among the team at Northrop Grumman."
good,"As a test technician, I executed operational tests to characterize the performance of assemblies for use in unmanned aircraft.  Learning how my work tied into the performance of the aircraft was exhilarating.  Working with a tight-knit group helped foster learning and passion for the day's workload.  Out-of-spec conditions were viewed as challenges that we gladly took head on."
good,you get a chance to learn allot with this company. But they do not give raises
good,Exciting and challenging work environment that promotes growth from within.
good,Overall the cooperation is well respected. Living abroad in the Middle East had challenges to overcome. Working with a diverse culture made it interesting but frustrating at the same time.
good,Best part of working for a large company is the amount of collaboration that can take place
good,"employees increase their level of knowledge in cyber security and cyber warfare"
good,as a contractor you are like the *uncared for* child of two companies.
good,A typical day could include responding to indoor air quality or ergonomic concerns of an employee.
good,"•	Responsible for Master Tickets and escalation to management."
good,"There's a lot to learn in a big company like this ,most of which you can add to your life experience in becoming a mechanic or parts inventories."
good,"typical day, go to work at 5am run a few test on the equipment to make sure it's ready to use for the day, talk with the production people to see if they needed anything. 8am go to staff meeting, train new operators, watch current operators to make sure they are following procedures, the best part about that job was the people (operators in the lab), the management not so good"
good,Worked with a great bunch of program managers and staff.  Enjoyed going to work and learned every day.
good,The shipyard had tight sense of a community within a community.  They really give you a warm welcome and tend to help when they can.
good,"I enjoyed working at NG; however, I'm an Earned value master planner and the contracts I supported were not EV required - I didn't want to lose my skills in earned value."
good,The company is typical DoD manufacturer. There are cycles to jobs depending on the available contracts. I enjoyed working there.
good,I have applied over 200 job positions in the past 4 years with no contact or establish interviews.
good,Detail oriented Program Manager with agile experience that has previous experience leading large professional teams to develop and implement software development solutions for various Department of Defense branches.
good,Northrop is a great place to learn!!  Advancement is more difficult in this economy but there are no shortages of ways to be recognized for hard work.
good,"Good Job, relaxed atmosphere, great benefits and salary, semi-flexible hours"
good,"I worked for them in Lake Charles, LA and it was a good contract assignment."
good,"Typical Day at Work - After checking email and voicemail, check to see if there is a test article to test.  Get paperwork and wait for appropriate test personnel to arrive.  Begin test after test article has been setup.  Test the device in accordance with the latest Acceptance Test Procedure.  If test takes more than a day, which is typically the case, secure the test article for the evening at an appropriate step for continuing the test on the next day."
good,"Didn't care too much for the location, but the job itself was a worthwhile experience."
good,Working at Northrop is challenging and rewarding and no two days are alike.  Work assignments consistently evolve in a fast pace inviroment to ensure we always meet our customers needs no matter what the requirement may be.
good,"very hard worker, I liked to help coworkers out when my job is finished. did the best I could to be a good worker."
good,Overall great place to work. Great Co workers. The benefits are good as well as some of the people.

good,"There's really nothing special about the work environment. It tends to be a fairly laid back place, but everyone sits in tiny, identical cubicals. Between the cubicles and the management, working here feels a lot like a Dilbert comic strip come to life."
good,Laying out nuclear pipping systems IAW drawings and/or blueprints.
good,"I worked there for 9 years.  A good company to work for."
good,"While the benefit of commuting is short, the typical work day is slow, co-workers are great to interact with but there is very little management around."
good,"I love the team.  I respect the customer.  I hate the system I work on because it is the most unstable software imaginable.  The compensation is just barely too little for my family though.  The benefits are great.  The culture is too.  In a better time for finances, perhaps this is a great place to stay.  But being paid less than I made on an active duty enlisted salary is unacceptable."
good,I spent over 25 years at this company with little to no opportunity for growth. Exceptional training available but very difficult to climb the corporate ladder.
good,"Flexible, rewarding, competent Management, great people, interesting, worst part were a number of us were laid off."
good,"The project that I worked on with Northrop Grumman was not interesting.  That said, the salary, benefits, and professionalism of the company was good, but when you have an uninteresting client or project with NG, it can be a difficult job to enjoy.  That is not a criticism of NG, per se, and can be true of any organization, but it is to say that that was my experience when I was with NG."
good,"Nice government contracts while I was employed there.  Typical day was very routine as I typed what the Engineers brought my way, I had very little responsibility.  Co-workers were very nice and became friends.  Management was a little top heavy at times.  My immediate manager was very nice and was company minded."
good,That was really good working with this company.Management was extra - ordinary.I could learn few good things regarding my work.
good,"Overall it is an as expected large company.  The company pays well, but once you get in the door it is hard to get good raises.  It took me several years to realize I had to fight for myself with the company to get proper pay raises and recognition.  If you don't mind every year fighting for yourself to ensure you get a decent raise then this is a good place.  The technology is always top class and you can't find another place with the same cutting edge technologies therefore you would have many challenges & objectives within the job.  The most frustrating thing is the sense of the good ol' boy nature within management.  There is always a lack of progress because of this mentality."
good,"Overall Northrop Grumman is a good place to work.  However, employees must be careful for who within the company they are working.  There was not a clear path to advancement.  Also, if you are not ""in the clique"" It will be very hard for you to get on the good projects to get the advancement you seek."
good,"Very good company to work for, if you get lucky.  Everyone I met while working as a contractor was friendly and professional.  Very competitive workplace."
good,"Great place to work.  Depending on your education status, you can go far."
good,Demanding and competitive environment with a lot to offer its employees.
good,A customer focused work environment. Great benefits with opportunities for advanced education.
good,"The contract I worked on wasn't well managed which definitely had a negative affect on the quality of life for myself and fellow co-workers. There was too much good-old-boy favoritism at the top on our project. On other projects, coworkers seemed happy to work for NG."
good,"Interesting work that is organized for an independent research group.  Some projects are generally short term and others are for long-term support of established programs.  "
good,Extended my knowledge as a Computer Technician. Allowed freedom to make decisions. Team work was exceptional
good,"The company is broken, unless you work in Huntsville, it's hard to get anything done with it."
good,"A typical work day consisted of me managing about 120 union employees.  The job consisted of me taking roll and then assigning work to the mechanics for the day.  After completion of each job assignment I was to verify any discrepancies regarding federal government documents.  I had to meet with the employee to discuss any problems that they might have had on that assigned job, providing them with coaching and direction when needed.  I managed the team that Issued and received MRAP vehicles for the soldiers when then there for training purposes.  My co-workers worked extremely closely together on a daily basis to get the mission completed.  This comprise of any emails, via teleconference calls to assist with the mission.  The most challenging part about my job was times when I couldn't provide the type of customer service I knew that I was capable of giving to the government due to budget restraints regarding certain tools that was needed to get the job done more proficient.  The most enjoyable time is when my employees work to provide the United States military with impeccable customer service that they wasn't expecting.  Going beyond the call is what I like to refer as."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was traveling 3 weeks out of the month.  Racked up some major hotel and flight points.  I learned a great deal about military healthcare and enjoy deploying our software to army, navy, air force, and marine post/bases.  Although the project was long term, it was time for me to get off the road.  Most of the guys I was on the road with were burnt out and it didn't help when we didn't have replacement, but instead management rotated us in and out of those military treatment facilities.  The company was small and we had access to the developers and network engineers to support us while on site.  In the end, Northrup Grumman bought out the company and I left a few weeks after."
good,"Attendance call before work, after lunch and in the last half hour of the shift."
good,"I learned how to use SAP. It's not user friendly but when you learn, it is a good accounting system."
good,Managers were cordial enough - but can't say there was much diversity in their product line.  Over two year period there was incremental reduction in force.  Doubt seriously this could be avoided.
good,"Worked in nuclear test engineering, department is always falling behind schedule which requires employees to work extra.  Upper management not concerned with safety.  Coworkers were great people."
good,a job that was fascinating in its technicality and the overall versatility of each days task
good,"•Aligned, tested, and troubleshooting laser systems which cost $20,000 per unit"
good,Many of the projects that I worked on were in the military space so most were important to our nation from that perspective. Some of that technology was being used immediately in the field. This part of the job was exciting.
good,"Flexible Work Schedule, decent benefits. Just like most of the other defense contractors out there."
good,"I got my security clearance through NG. I only worked for them for about 4 months. Had a situation in where I was being wrongfully reprimanded for me not wanting to go on a mission which is usually done by the Biometrics mobile enroller who get paid more for that purpose. I asked for the pay to go with it and said that I won't go unless I get properly compensated. I was sent a letter of reprimand by the head of HR who took sides against me for that matter. The entire time I was going through that dispute, it was all one sided, it was already pre determined that I was going to get reprimanded no matter if I was right or not for ""insubordination"". I ended up quiting and going home. the company preaches that their employees are their biggest assets but when I wrote a letter to the VP of the business unit, I got totally ignored."
good,A technically challenging environment with great people to work with but has many bureaucratic policies that make it difficult to be efficient.
good,Technical Administrative Assistant – Desktop Support for Coors Brewery contract
good,"Was Great place to work, gave me the freedom to do my job without interference."
good,"NG has subcontracted out many of the websites you are required to use on a weekly or daily basis. If you are on a remote location like many of us are, it can be difficult to get help or assistance on many of the sites. The Education site doesn't even accept emails."
good,"• Utilize the Oracle Portal Application to design and develop the portal, web applications, and a host of other websites nested within the portal for the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA)"
good,"Focuses on employee development. Typical 9a-5p job. No comment on managers, each manager is different. Most enjoyable part of the job is engagement. Focuses on employee engagement which is great."
good,"Company with deep heritage in the Aerospace industry, with a very deep engineering/scientific expertise."
good,This organization is filled with good people that want to do the right job for the right reasons.
good,Work is great most days. I enjoy my job and have had 14 years here. I recently received a layoff that seemes unfair. I have learned a lot of new skills and I hope to find another position in this company.
good,"It was an unusual job, in that for everyone in Northrop Grumman I answered to I answered to two civil service bosses. But very good technically."
good,Fine place to work
good,I learn new thigs everyday but I would like a better work environment and more growth.
good,"Days at work where like any typical work place, but it was a good experiance."
good,Fairly typical work/life balance. Very demanding if you are a pricing analyst though. Coworkers are somewhat standoffish.
good,"The Facility I work at has, for the most part, a good management structure though it's between a weak and strong Matrix system which can make project management difficult."
good,Constant changes in leadership. Hard to get a good team working together.
good,Excellent opportunity to learn from the best in Aerospace industry. Many employees well over retirement age still working and most are willing to mentor.
good,"No one listens to the younger guys, even if you have a good idea that could save the company money. No information could be ""sent up the line"" reliably. Your ideas, if they were used, were twisted or stolen to be used by someone else, or my favorite politic'ed around to the point of being useless."
good,"I designed various components within Hull Closures. Learned alot about the shipyard world although my specific dept had some management issues. Got along with all my co workers, but favoritism would have been the hardest part of my job. The most enjoyable part of the job was the way co workers helped each other and communicated. I would have much rather been in a department where I could have used my degree which would allowed more growth."
good,I believe the biggest issue is that there are not enough resources to help with an evergrowing workload.
good,"My day usually starts out with putting out fires, then I review all requisitions, monitors factory attrition, and work on training topics for my co-workers."
good,"Very good company with good opportunities and benefits. Excellent growth opportunities, and I learned skills that have helped me in my career."
good,Great company for experience and opportunity to work in cutting edge of defense industry. NG has a great reputation as defense contractor in the industry and many opportunities for various roles and positions in contractor industry.
good,I loved the work and the people. Working in Configuration Management Release was a rewarding experience. I also controlled our manuals and policies.
good,I learned alot working for this company as far as how to work. I picked up another trade I would use the rest of my life.
good,Benefits and pay are competitive but retention is low. Doesn't seem to retain valuable talent or match outside offers. Has a huge variance in management teams. Compliance is obscure and there is no solid on the job training. Corporate is striving for more work life balance but it does not flow down through the sectors that way. How I am able to support in a civilian fashion while no longer able to wear the uniform is my favorite part of the job. The constant revision of forms and the inconsistency in compliance personnel are beyond frustrating.
good,The company is always interesting work and projects to work on.  One drawback is that the company is large and does have that large feel as if you are just a number.
good,Cool work. Good work life balance. Lots of ups/downs in work amount. Poor management. Poor utilization of employees. Slower work pace. Poor facilities.
good,They like to bid on many US Government contracts and sometines they don't have enough bodies to do all of them. Have a good pricing system (Pro Pricer) which is intuitive and coworkers are knowledgeable. 9/80 work shift is a big bonus.
good,"Worked with the UR&R team. Recruited college interns and new graduates for positions in Aerospace sector.Phone screened candidates, presented them to hiring managers for an onsite interview. Traveled to campuses and conference to assist with campus interview and selection."
good,The best experience at this company will be for individuals who are hired as an intern or right after graduation and are granted a security clearance.
good,"If you are provided with the right tools, you can do you job well.  Management always rewarded successful staff.  If you have the right education for your experience, you can be promoted within."
good,"I've really loved working at this company, the group of individuals I work with are unmatched. My only real complaints are about the company culture. Northrop is run by people who focus on the past and how things used to be done. In terms of benefits, and what they have the potential to offer their employees, they are severely lacking. They have the potential and overhead to offer longer maternity leave, better tuition reimbursement, cheaper, and more widely offered medical benefits, and they choose not to. Working in recruiting and seeing what these other companies are offering to their candidates, Northrop is coming up short in a big way. They put a lot of pride into their annual survey results, but absolutely lack on follow through when it comes down to what their employees are actually asking for."
good,"I worked in a private company that was bought by Northrop Grumman. They still have Amherst Systems on their website."
good,Northrop has it together as far as the company as a whole goes.  It can be a little daunting at first because the onboard process is something you get thrown into on your own because nobody remembers where they went to do it as it is all online.  The program is where you see things start to falter and I never really felt like there was opportunity above.  Over time the benefits have kept getting worse which seems odd for a company of this size.  I strongly feel that the executives take too much of the funding and should pay better as the first time I worked there i was laid off.  Meanwhile the head of that sector received a 17 million dollar bonus.  Seriously?  Nothing you could do is so hard that you honestly deserve 17 mil bonus. especially when people are getting laid off.  Maybe one day corporate america will change or maybe one day we will stand up against the tyranny
good,I was a software manager that was stressful.  I quit the job after working at Northrop Grumman for 25 years on various projects.  Some of the projects required travel.
good,Worked for a year as a contractor and made just as much as i was offered to go perm.  Made more than double taking a position with a mortgage company.
good,"Very slow paced work environment.  At times, fun place to work with fun activities.  Excellent benefits from day one.  That alone almost makes up for the downsides."
good,Being a defense contractor much of the freedom to exceed and to be creative is constricted by the tension between the Government and the Company. The climate is persistently overly political.
good,The most enjoyable part of the day was always when the work Day started and when the work Day ended. It started to get difficult for me to work extended hours after doing it for so long.
good,Hard for young Engineers to advance. Management doesn't always have your best interest in mind and HR is not helpful and can get in the way of good opportunities
good,Do not hire in as a contractor!!!!!!   They hire im quick but get dismissed juzt az fast. Juzt go ahead and take the extra time to hire in as an ingalls employee. Plus the benefits.  Your contract with ingalls as a contractor is only a year. If you make it that long.
good,Decent Benefits and manageable work hours. When I worked there I did not have much to do since I did not have any clearance. I believe that if I did the job would have been much more fulfilling.
good,Consultant at Northrop Grumman treated fairly and placed on assignment at the Social Security Administration Headquarters and others at the Center for Medicare Services (CMS) to fill IT positions in those agencies.
good,"Pays the bills but is always changing work times,and paper work is always changing. No stability with this current military/government program. Lots of lazy standing around people...""Good enough for government work attitude"
good,"Although wonderful folks to work with during my tenure I discovered that upon contract recompete and failures to secure the longevity of a contract employees were let go. This would be expected however the management gave the opposite information to their employees and some were caught unaware. Others jumped ship when they were ""leaked"" the information. Northrop was ill prepared to rehome over 60 employees within and left many quite disillusioned and in sudden despair. When it was good it was great. When it failed it failed across the board in terms of Management communications and honesty."
good,"I worked for NG for almost 6 years. However, NG has laid me off since March 8, 2018. They have been very poor in reassigning me or other employees to another position."
good,Typical work day is ok.  You learn many things and technoloies. Management is not good. Culture is fair. Lots of processes. The most enjoyable part is there's a gym and the cafeteria.
good,"I was helping our military aircraft do their job. I was trained to do something that (I was told) only 25 people in the world knew how to do."
good,"Northrop has many projects and one's experience will depend largely on which group you are in. I've worked there in four different groups and some are better than others. One was good, two were poor, one was awful. In general, the experience was better than average,.as is the pay. Numerous  managers on some projects had a reputation for incompetence. On one project, contractors were led to believe the project would last a year, but all were laid off when the project was cancelled for lack of funds."
good,"Work environment is ok, management is lacking.  It appears that folks promoted to management forgot how to support the rank and file who do the day to day."
good,I liked working at the AIT Center but the travel got to be to much so I had to find something else. 
good,Overall NG is a fine place to work as aerospace companes go.  I am looking to leave only because I have come to learn that people in Colorado as a whole are overly concerned with what other people are doing.
good,Not a bad place to work.  Offers flexibility to work from if needed.  Work is challenging and can change significantly from task to task.  There are opportunities to work in different roles or locations that come up from time to time.  Management supports employees who want to do this.  The only negative is that some times projects are under staffed and/or requirements aren't fully defined often leading to work life balance getting out of hand.
good,"I have nothing bad to say about NG. My experience there was fair. The biggest challenge I faced was dealing with the negotiated dynamic with the client at the Social Security Administration (SSA). Even with a managerial position with the client, there is little authority to enforce policies. To effect change, you must have the ability influence the decision makers, which will likely be personnel employed by the client."
good,"Collaboration was not tolerated.  Strict ""stay in your lane"" policy.  Lack of test equipment and basic office space.  The best enjoyable part of the job was the location."
good,Noisy workplace and poor functional leadership.  Team work is lack of experience and commitment.  Tool sets and computing resources are not efficient.
good,"Although I'm sure that there are other areas of the company that offer growth and expansion, I got thrown into a project I wasn't particularly crazy on or thought was relevant to my career... As a competitive student in Mechanical Engineering, I worked on Excel sorting through part inventories. I could tell that my functional manager felt bad for me being in this position (kind of a, what the heck are you doing here? Expression). High turnover and lots of (vocally) frustrated and burnt-out full-timers at my office, which was separate from the main campus. Felt pretty isolated, and it was a pretty unfriendly environment. I don't think anyone took their lunch break. There would be many days where I would speak to no one face to face... Just sitting in my cube staring at spreadsheets... But it paid well, and my mentor/dotted-line manager was a fun guy (too bad he'll be retiring soon). HR wined and dined the interns, we got a free lunch every week."
good,"A typical day at work consists of reading and responding to emails, while working out issues with the production floor."
good,"I worked at Northrup Grumman for 5 years. Unfortunately I was laid off with 119 other employees in 2011.  I enjoyed working at NG, they offered work/life balance hours in which you have every other Friday off."
good,"Fast paced, stressfull, constantly pulling future work in to increase annual sales. This forces upper management to secure new business with smaller budgets to be competitive, sometimes sacrificing margin to maintain cost over-runs."
good,"I worked at the city of Indianapolis originally do all the printer support around the city city/county building, police, fire, DPW. They offered training and retirement package."
good,"This lab was not cutting edge when it came to it's standards and upkeep on their procedures. The lab is quite old and run down, but the pay is good and the food at the food service is top rate with no need to go out for lunch if you were too busy to make a drive."
good,"Reading and laying out blueprints for material and foundations."
good,I was a contact to hire employee and was very disappointed in working here with the exception of pay. Over 900 of us were told on Tuesday of one week that we had not been employed since the previous Thursday.
good,"Overall, Northrop is a great place to work. They have excellent benefits. However, too many office politics, bonuses do not exist if you are not at the top 10% of best employees, and moving on to a different position or getting a promotion is a joke."
good,"My personal opinion, the management can be improve to help.  I have learned and improved a lot with the company. The hardest part of the job is when everyone are not corporate to solve the issues."
good,"Worked with a lot of different technologies in the development stack, unfortunately not many developers with strong interests in learning new technologies,"
good,"Schedule driven job which has high demands but lacks the tools/technology to deliver. "
good,"Northrop is a great company and the work environment at my particular office is very nice. However, it's easy at a company like Northrop to get stuck developing skills that aren't widely necessary."
good,"Pay isn't great, work you to death, great health benefits. Management isn't the best, very political. The company's name looks great on your resume, however it's not worth the stress."
good,Although I enjoyed my time working for Northrop Grumman on this contract I found the culture and working environment deteriorated greatly after the project manager changed to the current one.
good,"•	Prep different metals and alloys by sanding, sand blasting, grinding or chiseling to create a smooth surface for painting."
good,"Very large company. A lot of room to change roles if you have the contacts and are willing to relocate. "
good,"Northrop Grumman offers many benefits and options to grow and become a more skilled professional.  The employees are very helpful and insightful. The corporate culture is a more conducive of a ""family"". Management is available but more leaders are needed."
good,"I have had to move ""jobs"" several times to stay employed.  The industry is so connected to the DOD that when it ebbs and flows, so does work and job security."
good,"A typical day as a Customer Service Representative is being on the phone. The phone lines are extremely busy. "
good,"Great benefits and business structure.  Working there is a true learning experience, however, upper management is not easily accessible."
good,"Lots of very intelligent people to work with, and the company invests a lot in training their employees."
good,"Great co-workers due to the fact that we are mostly veterans. I felt that the managment was out of touch with the workers. I had one manager introduce himself to me five times due to the fact that they are covering so many projects. It is a great job with great people, but being a DoD contractor it constantly feels like one could be laid off at any time."
good,I was very productive and aware of all my surrouding duties while employed there.
good,"Performed multiple tasks such as fixing abends using CA-7 scheduling tool and performed IPL's on multiple mainframe systems."
good,"Ideal company to work for outside of the shared services division. There is not much opportunity for growth and development in their shared services department, but across the company there is. Management needs to be weeded out; there are some outstanding managers there and some very unethical managers. Fast paced environment with minimal recognition / employee engagement."
good,"I've worked with several programs at this company.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with the program management who won't look before they leap.  It also depends on the area you're in.  If you're in a well organized business area where good decisions are made and justified, where people know what they're doing, you'll be satisfied with your job.  Otherwise, you're in an area where everyone throws problems over the fence rather than help resolve them. And management will sweep it under the rug and hide the ugly truth from those higher up the chain.  I've worked in both types of areas.   "
good,The whole company was about if you where in the click or not. It is nice to get a hand sometimes but once you do you should have to carry your on way to the top. I got offered an opportunity by the facilitation committee to help train our people in the SAP computer program due to my previous experience at doing this at another company. When I brought this to my manager she told me no and sent her friend in my place. This person had no previous training in this system Regular practice in this company. The only thing I can say good is that I had long term employment with some decent benefits and slightly below average salary.
good,"A good place to work."
good,Great products for our national defense. Policies and procedures pushed down from the government are making it a very unsatisfying place to work.
good,"all hangars were well maintained, management was very helpful."
good,Very busy job that includes working on Navy ships including duct work and intake/exhaust systems.
good,"Tons of opportunity for engineers. Opportunities for other support functions (i.e. business management, etc.) are limited. Must be willing to move/relocate for the job. Programs and opportunities move so if you want to do well in the company, you must be willing to move. Must be motivated to work hard and long hours."
good,When contract went to another company NGC made no effort to find other work for me. Had to follow contract to other company.
good,Northrop grumman is a very busy work environment. We always give our best to support our customers. Management aren't as easy to work with unless you find the right one. My co workers are very friendly and I have developed a long lasting friendship with quite a few of them. The hardest part of the job is making sure everything is near perfect. Management expects the best from its employees so being excellent in everything you do without making mistakes can be tough. The most enjoyable part of my job is all of the friends I have now. We are like family and it feels like home at the workplace.
good,"During my tenure here at Northrop Grumman, I have been involved in some critical technical programs benefiting the US Depart of Defense (DoD) ranging from radio communication system design to network management system design."
good,I enjoy my actual job itself but the pay isn't enough for the responsibilities and accountability that I have.
good,"Initially it was a good place to think about spending a career--like 30 years because the work was truly exciting and cutting edge and the management was all about helping you to succeed. After 2008, things began to sour and the culture changed for the worse. Management turned away from research and development and instead focused on short term goals. The change was similar to what happened to Bell Labs and the IBM research labs. Bottom line performance is the new mantra with no top line growth."
good,Great benefits and a strong company that works on big projects. Good flexibility to work from home often and promised (and sometimes delivered) 9/80 schedules.
good,"A lot of ""old school"" thinking mitigating progress. It's often all about the power point presentation more than the substance, or as a colleague once stated, it's a lot of ""pretengineering""."
good,"The company had a wide variety of personell, older, younger, female and ethnic. There were opportunities to move from position to position within the company. The people were supportive and dedicated."
good,"I love what I do and the company as a whole, but the department management is ridiculous. There are promises made for change and nothing done; no one is held accountable and it puts a bad taste in your mouth when you work as hard as you do."
good,"Responsibilities and expectations are high, and the pay is very low in comparison to the importance of the job.  A typical day at work...high stress and busy from the time you enter until departure, which is great as it helps time pass. Training was interesting, could use some structure. Management is ok, the culture is pretty good. There are some pretty good folks there with kind hearts. The hardest part of the job is getting through the day to day duties. The most enjoyable part...departing daily."
good,"I have worked for 3 defense contractors now, and they are all very much the same.  The work is very stable, but depending on what team you are on, you will most likely be working with very old technology."
good,"The work schedule 9 hour days / 80 allows every other Friday off is wonderful!  Working from home is an option, the 401K matching is excellent and the PTO is exceptional."
good,Work can be slow and repetitive for most due to long winded programs. Lots and lots of low skill laborious tasking. Few individuals are coached for advancement. Continuous turnaround / hiring process.
good,"Everything works like it's supposed to, you work your 80 hours per 2 weeks and get your pay check on time.  Managers were very accommodating and hours were flexible.  When work was not classified they were usually OK with occasional remote work."
good,"The people are great, multitasking is a must, challenging work and your exposed to every department at Northrop Grumman. The overall benefits are good."
good,It was an okay job. Would have liked a better salary.I enjoyed the training and the people were okay. Not much to do in the Herndon location. Free parking
good,Quiet and comfortable working conditions. Mostly career minded professionals are hired. Workspace is huge and local cafeteria on-site is extremely beneficial.
good,"My “career” with Northrop Grumman was 9-years long. I was hired when Wes Bush was coming in as the new CEO and laid off when Kathy Warden was transitioned in."
good,"I drove 220 miles per day (from Ventura, CA to Palmdale, CA). I was at work by 7:00 a.m.and worked until 4:00 p.m. I was a weekly contributor/reporting member to the B-2 Bomber Directorate for Supply Chain Management. I was also in charge of ascertaining Affordability Savings from the Contracts Department. The hardest part of my job was getting people to provide their information on time each week for the weekly Directorate meetings.and getting them to update the Supplier Assessment Management System (SAMS)."
good,"Northrop Grumman was good to me as an employee overall.  I had 6 years of stable employment with them overall (two seperate long-term federal contracts as a GIS Analyst.  The program management was more of a hands-off style, which, at higher levels in many lines of work, a lot of people like.  On the down side, I honestly felt like just a number sometimes and like program management wasn't interfacing with their team enough on a more personal level beyond just day-to-day business.  This was also evident in the fact that program management was not always as in-touch with changes (or lack of progression) actual nature of roles for of their contractors, which may have simply been a function of the client simply not telling them everything when updating a program manager (as is their perogative as the client to some degree), program managers having too much to manage and just can't keep more periodically with everyone, or whatever the reason was.  Simply put, I wish it would have been possible to know my program manager on a more personal level and have more opportunities to interface with them on how things were actually going as a mere employee.  It seemed as though team leads below them had the lion's share of opportunities for this degree of essential interfacing."
good,"Currently, NGC growth opportunities are endless. If you are a go getter, able to figure things out on your own, and willing to put in long hours, this is the job for you.  If you want to be trained, be provided mentorship, and have a clear statement of work, then look somewhere else."
good,Good place to work. I enjoy working with my fellow co-workers. Never had a problem with management. Northrop has some really good people working for them. It’s just time for a change.
good,I think it is hard to advancement within the company I have been trying for 3 years now. It is a great place for travel but I have been on travel for the past 15 years. I trying to get something stable in one place. Hopefully in Louisiana or texas.
good,"northrop was great,i recommend it. i did everything there , please see resume, the only down side was the location in Palmdale california  plenty of worj there  longevity is a bonus, i moved to new york , that is the reason why i left"
good,"Enjoyed working with the company an my manager until after 7 years they changed management. I enjoyed the fact that I could continue my education which company paid for. Had very good benefits, vacation and salary."
good,"Although mostly known as a defense contractor, Northrop Grumman had a significant presence in the government Health and Human Services business.  Very risk adverse."
good,"Always feeling pressured with long work hours.Sometimes as long as 12 hours. No time to even take a lunch."
good,"A circa 1975 engineering workplace culture. Seeks to retain young talent on executive slides, yet rather build a designated smoking area on site than offer better health benefits. Misinforms new talent when explaining merit system. Senior and executive management are detached from employees.  "
good,"Work was taxing but enjoyable. As a air defense trainer, I was working with air defense personnel from an country in Africa. The language issues and length of course proved challenging in being able to hold the attention of the audience. Management was good for the most part.  Hardest part of the job was teaching for long errors with no break. The enjoyable part is when the training increases overall positive results."
good,"Great people"
good,"Great company to work for, get to work on challenging tasks in a collaborative team environment."
good,It is OK to work in Northrop Grumman  as it is an stable company to work in a big group of quality department including many engineers and technicians .
good,This is a good company to work for.  The pension plan is awesome.  The excellent management team.  Excellent compensation.  Great team men-ship. Real dedicated people.
good,Not a bad place to work.  The benefits aren't as good as other companies I've worked for.  They also make you track every little thing you do and charge it to a network.  If there's an event on campus they expect you to use your personal time to attend.
good,"Many good opportunities for engineers.  Fewer opportunities to do interesting research and development.  Good salary and benefits. Immediate managers are good, executive leadership often makes decisions that cause chaos at the lower levels without regard for people having to accommodate that chaos.  High-level leadership does a poor job explaining actions and strategy."
good,Standard aviation job. Repair or make modifications to aircraft. Then proceed to opchecks. Comply with all necessary publications and standards. Good people.
good,"Great place to work. But layoffs occur if loss of too many contracts."
good,"Northrop Grumman as a company looks good on paper; however, they need to learn how to treat all of their employees better. Irrespective of which segment of the organization they fall into. All people have the right to be respected and should be given the opportunity to be productive during all phases of their career. Management should be more honest with regard to the reasons that their hands are tied during employee reviews as well... Most people do not deserve the ratings that they are receiving, but some managers are not forthcoming with the real reasons that marks are sometime lower than expected..."
good,"Good compensations and vacation days. Friendly environment but an older crowd. Small site, not a lot of work events, and no cafeteria. Usually a 9/80 schedule  for employees"
good,"My employment ended at NG in Redondo Beach, CA about 8 years ago, and at the time, management was not particularly effective."
good,"Great benefits"
good,I have been working as a contractor for 3 years now and am proud to say my first job in this industry was at Northrup Grumman. However I am a little frustrated and disappointed that I never received an opportunity to become an employee or advance in my career at Northrup Grumman.
good,"PROS:"
good,It's a good company. The only drawback if youare contracting is that getting promoted can be very challenging despite of proving your mettle.
good,"I learned a lot about fingerprints, understanding USCIS immigration paperwork and procedures. Worked with a high volume of people in a fast paced environment. Everyone was great to work with and would help each other when possible."
good,I worked hard at this company and I have a good relationship with all the clients I work with while working for NG.
good,"Management on my project was poor (every team member tried to leave/change teams many times).   Job/Balance was great, except travel times were either early in AM, or late in evening."
good,Northrop Grumman provides an environment in which the employees play integral roles in the development of new business opportunities. Each employee is empowered with the sense of knowing that their individual contributions can lead to the expansion of the business. The current fiscal environment; as well as acquisition processes pose challenges to NG growth and opportunity space within the local area.
good,The company allows flexible work schedule and the 9/80 work schedule. Management is supportive of their employees and and are available for mentoring.
good,"At Northrop-Grumman I wore three hats and my day depended upon what events were taking place that day. "
good,Management does not consider the employee when making significant decisions that effect the employees working conditions
good,Management limits freedom of ideas.  Learned to manage my time to efficiently complete projects on time.
good,A good company to work for however I find working with the public much more rewarding.
good,"Good Company. Great place to start your career. Highly recommend Northrop Grumman, very good benefits."
good,"A typical day is summitting reports, talking to customers, maintain funding for subcontractors and meetings."
good,A typical day at work is patroling and responding to security isues. I learn something new everyday at work. It's makes the job more interesting and more challenging. Managemnet requires us as officers to do our job and always stay professional. My co-workers are wonderful. The hardest part of the job is dealing with different personalities. The most enjoyable part of the day is knowing I did my best.
good,The best part of working for this company was the ability to move to full time teleworking in support of our clients project.
good,It wasn't the easiest job but it provided me with a reliable income and insurance for my family.
good,"It seems that the upper management is always at odds with shop managers. Also the customer, DOL is always looking to make the company look bad."
good,I LOVED working for Northrop Grumman and grew both personally and professionally while working there. I was sad to leave due to lack of work.
good,I will not list any pro/con's about NGIS. They hired me out of college and I am so thankful to them for this. I have learned 5 times more from this company than college ever taught me.
good,Very inconsistent in dealing with people. Promotes on who you are versus skills/education.
good,"If you're content with sitting in a metal box watching people walk by with only the occasional occurrence that requires your attention, then this is the job for you."
good,"Has ups and downs. Very little stress most of the time, but little incentive to do more than required. Working for the military also comes with a hit to your conscious."
good,"Consider pros and cons of working at a large company. Decent pay, great benefits, and some work/life balance. Narrow roles, bureaucratic, decentralized management."
good,"Great company to get started! I enjoyed my team and our mission. I received an offer that Northrop couldn't match at the time, but they were super courteous and understanding! I would recommend this company."
good,"Decent wages, decent benefits, and decent work/life balance. Nothing that will keep you loyal to the company but nothing that will make you want to quit."
good,"Work mostly within  my scope of work, providing primary labor tasks to the workplace. Also worked other positions with the company over the 6 years I worked there."
good,"They do not make an allowance for on the job training. Regardless of your skill level you are required to be productive right from the start, even if you are learning a new skill."
good,Great work conducted by Northrop which was very instrumental in helping me grow in my carreer.  Northrop is very employee centric.  Always making sure employees are rewarded and heard.
good,"The company and benefits are great. Its the people ans ways of doing things in old outdated manner which brings it down. I have learned a great deal while there, but would not return."
good,"Good place to work, just hope you get good management. Do your job and be back on time from lunch, talk to people in the Union to be safe, and secure."
good,Was a great place to work for 3 years. Learned a lot of information. Met a lot of great people. Room for furthering education and it is very quiet atmosphere in terms of when working in the office.
good,"NGC spends a lot of time and money on employee surveys each year.  Depending on the group and the manager, they may take action and make changes.  "
good,"Large organization with a lot of red tape.  Steady work though and it can be rewarding.  Lots of good people, but also some bad.  Moving up can be difficult if you aren't well connected."
good,Work is interesting but management is very unorganized. To many new grads which created a major experience loss. Nice digs in unsecure building which has pool and foose ball tables.
good,The company is focusing on career development and diversity.  For those that have a passion for aircraft and for the defense of our country this is the place to work
good,Northrop Grumman is a great company.  But the job I had to do was tedious.  I do not know how I lasted as long as I did.  It was the same thing over and over again just scanning and reviewing personnel files.  We worked in very tight quarters.  Hardest part was some of the people I had to work with.  Enjoyable was some of the people I met.
good,lots of opportunities but no locations in South Dakota with open potions. Great health care and benefits as well. fast paced and productive environment.
good,"I had a great time working for Northrop Grumman for 7 years. However, there were several instances where I witnessed racial tensions between employees and management"
good,Northrop Grumman is an aerospace company that requires more then 40 hours of productive effort per week. The workforce is older which prevents the young generation to display creativity.
good,It was a good position but they didn't invest in theyir employees as much as you would like. There is really nothing more for me to add about this position.
good,"Great management, benefits, etc. Employees at three small offices handling the majority of the geospatial work were laid-off. Contracts weren't renewed."
good,"Northrop likes to talk a big game to its employees about how much it cares. Local management cares about its employees by offering a great work/life balance. This is excellent. But upper management cuts pay increases and benefits, all the while crying to employees that the economy is making them suffer, when, in fact, the company is doing quite well. Cutting of benefits and pay increases would not be so hard to swallow if the company were just honest with its employees about why they chose to make the cuts, instead of trying to pull the wool over our eyes. What's more, upper management started a new performance incentive program that makes it nearly impossible for staff employees on small contracts to win earn this award, while employees working high profile contracts are always front runners. What's worse is the incentive program makes it very easy for middle-to-upper management to receive the award, while it becomes much more difficult the further down the ""food chain"" you are."
good,"good place to work.  environment is ever changing and can bring on fatigue.  Dedicated teammates, ethical company.  good benefits.  Commute times are very challenging."
good,"I enjoyed working with my staff. The other departments were great to work with too. The last six  months that I ,was there my staff was down to 3. I hated going to work."
good,"Team working environment, team leader is very support and knowledgable and willing to strive for your success. Working environment is productive and well organizes."
good,"I wasn't a real fan of this company simply for one reason, the actual workers that get out in the elements everyday and night don't get the justification that's due to them. these workers are not always acknowledeged"
good,"Large outdoors environment "
good,You cannot get anywhere in this company without a degree in Engineering or a technical background.
good,"Work-Life balance was very good.  My immediate Manager was awesome - friendly, good listener.  The teams that I worked with were professional and good communicators.  The work was very intermittent.  Not sure if there would be work available for another year if I stayed."
good,Great experience with lower lever design work with a company that is downsizing. Not a long term opportunity.
good,"A typical work day starts at 8am. I read emails from the night before and tickets from the night before. I get set for the tasks that I have to complete. I get as much as my work done before my superiors arrive. Any issues with my 13 subordinates are also handled in this time. Delegation of certain tasks are disseminated down to my shift leads. My site engineer is tasked with his daily to-do's. I ensure that my NOC is operating at optimal capacity while training my shift leads to spot any potential hazards. I typically work 10 to 12 hours a day, not including attending school or the gym. "
good,"A typical day at work consists of about 10 hours straight of nothing but meetings, phone calls, deadlines, and managing the status of projects. The hardest part of the job is not the job itself, but the workload. The workload never let up and only continued to increase with no relief. The most enjoyable part of the job was the great team of people that I got to work with on a daily basis along with great flex hours, vacation time, and benefits. Northrop Grumman pays well, but they expect you to do the work of 2 people. "
good,"I was lucky to be hired into a business unit of Northrop Grumman that feels more like a small company, but there is no escaping the corporation."
good,Not terrible to work from. But we were bought out and had been a smaller company. It was more fun working for a company where I felt they knew who you were.
good,Northrop Grumman is a good company to work for if you can handle life in the defense business. Product is very interesting.
good,A great company but stingy on the promotional pay. The engineering groups get all the money and are treated very well while the logistics group is treated as an afterthought.
good,"Northrop offers a wide range of work for all levels. Yet, they are still subject to defense spending changes."
good,Good working environment.  Good management support.  Always supply needed tools.  Challenging tasks and work.  Enjoyed research work and solving problems in project design.
good,"Day-to-day workload depends on which program you are working for. You could be really busy, or you could be sitting around twiddling your thumbs. The workplace culture is a bit outdated, and the technology needs updating. The best thing about the job is the 9/80 schedule."
good,"Long story short, they repeatedly transferred me from team to team saying, ""This team has development opportunities."" Each time, it was sustainment work, doing everything but touching code."
good,"Northrop Grumman is a great company to work for until the budget gets tight. Then you will be told not to come back after you leave one day, and you will not be told why."
good,"WAs able to get training on many vendors equipment ,learn  many things that help me with my next job , fellow employee were great  to work withb many benfitd"
good,"Very slow paced, very beuracratic - they base pay off a ""compa-ratio"" as you get closer to the median income for your position in the area your raises decrease."
good,"I love my job at northrope ... its a great company ..... management makes me want a new job ... thats only in my experience , other then that its a greate company"
good,"10hr work hours days, 6 days a week."
good,Northrop Grumman Federal Credit Union is a good company. They offer good benefits and you get paid on a weekly basis. We mainly service the employees of Northrop Grumman the corporation.
good,"Die Arbeit ist sehr präzise und Gewissenhaft"
good,The location of this job was extraordinary. A typical work day would involve learning current processes and determining if there was a better or more efficient way to perform the same job.
good,"Neutral feelings.. Good opportunities, archaic management structure.. A lot of people feel like they cannot make a difference due to the old and antiquated hierarchy"
good,"The best part about working at Northrop Grumman was the variety of work.  I provided marketing support for most of the East Coast Military Aircraft Systems programs.  Each day was different.  Different programs, different products, and I worked with great people.  "
good,good company and easy hour.  But the job is very dull and boring.  People arent motivated and the process is a horrible mess.
good,"There was always materials available for testing. The other quality engineers in our team and I (there were three total) would just divide up the materials as they came into our lab. Unless priority materials were needed on the manufacturing floor, it was very much a FIFO system. I learned a lot about QC and how a manufacturing operation is supported by quality. Management was a non-issue because we were such a small group that we barely needed management. However, I felt that this was our major flaw, no group wanted to accept us as part of their team so we were often rogues of the larger quality department. When we had problems they often fell on deaf ears and Engineering often quieted our concerns."
good,I did a lot of admisitrating to coordination major projects for Northrop Grumming in Planning and Scheduling.
good,"Northrop is a good place to work. They have there values and commitment. They have flex hours, off every other friday."
good,"Not enough work to keep me busy, manager informed. Noted that other people had same problem."
good,"Job was interesting but very cut throat by several individuals.  When contract reviews came due morale was very low, people were afraid of losing job.  After moving to new location and contract a new sense of purpose and reward was felt contract wide.  Program Manager was very hands on and actually cared about personnel"
good,"overview summary from a designers perspective:"
good,"Northrop Grumman was the one company where I worked the longest ( a total of 19 years) "
good,A day at work was always something different. I loved helping people in difficult situations.It was a very diverse group of people from all cultures of the world which made it very interesting at all times.
good,NG is a great company for keeping a balance of work and life with flexible schedules and good pay.  They are set up in a matrix structure which adds unnecessary work to jobs.
good,"I had a good crew. But no matter how good I thought they were I found out later ""SOME"" will turn on you if you hurt their feelings.,,,, No matter what you do to help them."
good,I tracked the welders.  Kept up data bases and spreadsheets on different jobs that the welders did.  I scheduled meetings in Outlook and made sure that the guys got to their trainings.
good,First job out of college. I was acclimated to a five day work week here with real tangible goals and saw the great results that come from hard work first hand.
good,"At Northrop Grumman you will grow and stretch beyond measures to your next destination.  Great work culture, flexible schedule, executive leadership have an open door policy"
good,"busy and productive company with room to grow. resigned due to personal reasons otherwise would still be there. My last manager I dont feel he knew what he was doing. But, previous managers were great."
good,Overall great place to work. The upper levels of MGMT screwed up our contract but that's typical. I would still work there if that had not happened.
good,"Prepared FMS case for reconciliations and closure packages."
good,"I have witnessed how new technologies were quickly adopted to revamp a legacy system so quickly. In you career, you rarely would have the opportunity to be part of a process that would re-write the same process, and for better, multiple times while remaining in production. Speaks of the passion of the leaders there."
good,"I've Interned for 3 summers."
good,benefits are excellent it just gets either too hot or too cold so drink plenty of water
good,Experienced professioinal  team. Learned and professional growth.
good,"- Employee Pay Scale for your current position is consider Company Proprietary. They force you to look elsewhere to know what you are worth"
good,"Company I guess is good, where the company is second the job is horrible. no caring about family. No asking if you would like to do something or if it impacts your family life. Just do it."
good,In my place of business I don't see everyone working collectively to perform the necessary tasks that have to be done
good,Management was terrible and the contract was on its decline. Morale was poor and my direct manager was fired for ethics violations.
good,"There was no advancement and benefits were slow to get them applied to me.  Overall good experience, but money was tight. I liked their 401k and education, but I had to ask many times before I got them."
good,There is too much time being wasted.  Too many empoyees and not enough work to keep them busy.  People walking around looking for work or doing nothing and getting paid big money.
good,"Extremely stressful w/no management support and impossible deadlines.  To do the job right, one must work a 70 hour week.  MANAGEMENT HAS ITS OWN AGENDA THAT IT DOES NOT COMMUNICATE.W/EMPLOYEES.  Most co-workers are professional and supportive."
good,"Good company but too many distractions from ""real"" work. Managment does not seem to have an open door policy and does not close the ""loop"" on issues. Forces change without explaning the benfits."
good,2nd shift great get more done
good,"The company did a great job improving processes, best practices and training employees. There were growing pains but they pushed hard to create standard practices which made designing flow much smoother across various subsystems. However, Management's expectations were unrealistic and mandated overtime to accomplish release goals which were not possible."
good,"Great if you are single without kids. Expect to travel and work from home or on vacation. This is not a punch out to end your day type of company. They will work you until you tell them to stop, then expect some push back."
good,"I really have enjoyed my job a lot!!! I am  beside myself  that I have to look for a new job I was really hoping to grow with the company but came to the realization that I am not going anywhere with my skills here at Northrop Grumman and this really saddens me. I have come along way in my department dealing with my robots and conveyor systems, most of all the people I deal with on a regular basis have been wonderful. I have been maintaining and keeping the plant going along with my fellow tech for almost 5 and half years now and really have enjoyed every minute of those years."
good,"You can be successful if you fit into the click.  Pushing older employees out, and replacing with younger workers.  Managing employees thru Metrics which does not account for everything required to get the job done.  Some employees are targeted by HR to get rid of them because of higher salaries they earned.  Everything is about cost at the disposal of employees"
good,"It's a great big defense contractor that has great jobs and professional growth opportunities.  Pay and benefits are competitive for the market, but less than in other markets for similar work."
good,"With current manager, communication is almost non-existent.  We are not thoroughly trained on standardization or expectations.  Forcibly independent at current overseas work location."
good,Company had recently experienced a merger with Northrop Grumman.  Mass exodus of key personnel.  Entirely new management.  Must have a bachelors degree to work here.
good,Good and or great company if you plan to go as far as a Program Manager or Lead Engineer. Once you reach a director level it begins to get extremely stressful and political. The company has some very cool work and very good opportunities to move around once inside the company. However the more senior you become the more political it becomes and many people are cut throat and deceptive. However the upper manager VP's I found to be great
good,"Most of the lower level management is good, most of the executive leadership is good, the mid level leadership is more concerned with politics and self promotion than the good of the people and the business."
good,While there is a lot of opportunity for growth and a great amount of thing to do. The environment is not one that promotes employee growth. Favoritisms and nepotisms are a little discouraging.
good,"Northrop Grumman as a company is great - there is something honorable and noble about working for a company that has such an impact on national security.  However, my former management (excluding my program manager) was terrible.  Gone all the time, didn't have common sense when it came to certain things, and blindly accepted every mandate handed down by higher ups without questioning it.  I'd never work for the PEOPLE I did ever again, but the company overall is great."
good,"My co-workers and my management on 2nd shift are Awesome. There are good people at my location, that are always ready to help. Our lake Charles site needs a new contract to build aircraft to support the war effort"
good,good test equipment;inadequate support;supervisors afraid to make decisions;comparisons made to other employees were unfair
good,Overall experience with company is good.  It is hard to move internally.
good,"Calibration process- mylar is layed flat on the Kongsberg GC300 Plotter ------targets applied ---after scanning mylar through CF500/44"
good,Working here breeds a special type of employee.  Most individuals here are highly motivated and organized.  The most enjoyable part of my job is working with our vendors. The hardest part of my job is to trying to leave. We get so caught up in the work sometimes we end up working long hours.  I miss out on spending time with my family.
good,"Work hours are flexible and depending on your position, you can be assigned to interesting engineering opportunities.  The management has changed and less personable.  Your functional manager may be in california and while your work is in New York.  When it comes time to be placed on another project you may not recieve the priority you deserve.  Merit based promotions and raises are given more on a senority basis than a person's ability."
good,"Many of us were hired when the management clearly majorly overestimated man power needs, with layoffs a year after hiring."
good,"It was a place to work with great co-workers, but the managers lied a lot to the workers. You would do great work in one area and they would move you from there to a new work assignment and move a senior worker into your place that you were doing great in."
good,"Lots of opportunity. Must play the corporate game to advance."
good,my workplace was bought out by Northrop Grumman and i cant say for them only my current workplace as the time of writing this  most managers and supervisors treat employees like lesser people what few good mangers and supervisors are there are constantly being moved around never staying in one area very long
good,"It is stressful and busy, but the benefits are good. Management was not very good. The site in Melbourne is having growing pains due to rapid growth. Overall not a bad place to work."
good,Depending on the area of focus it could required long hours and demanding schedules.  Work life balance is not high priority. Management displays good leadership and growth.  Workplace culture has its pockets of up and coming.
good,"It was nice to have multiple tasks, however the envionment was very stressful and hostile. The customers were easy to work with, however  some of the employees and managers were very ovearbearing and difficult."
good,"I had a great position at NG.  It's a highly-professional company that I recommend anyone work for.  That being said, I'm not sure if it was just my boss or this was reflective of the entire company, but there was a lot of stress for my work to be completely error free.  I was losing my mind trying to present the perfect product and it wasn't good enough.  Other than that, I really liked the job; the coworkers were wonderful, the pay was OK, and they allowed me to work from home if necessary."
good,"This is a great company to work for benefits and compensation wise. However, management and the process by which information is communicated leaves something to be desired. The advancement opportunities are limited depending on which location you are employed with and can be frustrating when trying to have a voice for the mechanics and technicians on the floor heard by management."
good,"Being in the world of Northrop it was family oriented, everyone was like family and stood together to make a great product."
good,"Because of National Security I cannot discuss the program or where and what we do.  I work with Tinker AFB and Whiteman AFB"
good,"I had worked at my job so many years that I could work the office by myself, which I had on many occasions. "
good,"Hard work is respected but not always rewarded."
good,"NG is your typical large aerospace contractor. Programs come and go every few years so you always have to be looking for your next job inside the company. If you can break through to the senior manager level then you have it made. Otherwise you are doing what I call the aerospace shuffle."
good,"Overall NGC is a great place to work, however there is not much room to advance or move up. Prior employment experience is not taken into account when trying to grow only NGC experience is reviewed."
good,"interesting place too work at, something new everyday, employee level management is great."
good,It was a short term contract and it was in another state. La. There was no life/work balance.
good,"Technology Driven Company, took my proposal of electronic process and developed/implemented."
good,Northrop Grumman has been a tremendous learning environment for me personally. The programs I supported were first class quality driven programs always striving to do better. The employee base was family oriented and supported one another throughout the duration of the contracts. The most challenging aspect of working with NG was maintaining a true work life balance. The most enjoyable aspect was knowing our products were superior in quality and knowing the warfighter reaped the benefits of our efforts.
good,"Not having anyone mentors in the position to learn from. Northrop like most big companies really has no loyalties to employees. You can work hard for them for years, and they will simply cut you loose when they dont feel the need for your services any longer. Dont expect anything different."
good,Great pay and benefits. A typical day was 8 hours (or more) of software testing to locate and define software errors before the software was released to the military.  
good,"Northrop like most big companies really has no loyalties to employees. You can work hard for them for years, and they will simply cut you loose when they dont feel the need for your services any longer.  Dont expect anything different."
good,Great place to work at CDC.Lot of things to learn. Great teammates.
good,Performs a wide variety of task assoicated with clerical and secretarial duties and activities specialized in the areas of Security. In my postion must be personable due to being a service organtion to employees and customers.
good,"Not the same company I started with 10 years ago, but still a good company to have as an employer. The option to work remotely is one of the main reasons I have stayed with the company as it allows for more work/life balance."
good,Fair pay. Progressive culture. Flexible hours with some telework options. Many different potential projects for you to work on. Management is very easy to approach.
good,"There are so many different possibilities within this corporation, you just have to look for them. It maybe a lot of work but it could be worth it. There are so many different ways to improve your career, your knowledge and your salary."
good,Good company to work for. Limited advancement opportunity. Great benefits including education assistance. Would work for again in a different  department.
good,"At the dawn of a new space age, Lockheed Martin is a pioneer, partner, innovator and builder. Our amazing men and women are on a mission to make a difference in the world and every day we use our unique skills and experiences to create, design and build solutions to some of the worlds’ hardest engineering problems. Our culture encourages employees to dream big, perform with excellence and create incredible products. We provide the resources, inspiration and focus and if you have the passion and courage to dream big, we want to build a better tomorrow with you."
good,"Meet with manager to discuss work, and then work for the rest of the day with two breaks and a lunch. People were very kind and team would go out for lunch. Management was kind but strict, and wanted the best from their team. I definitely learned to manage my time between my many tasks. I really enjoyed talking to the people on my team."
good,"Not rewarding people that leave the company and return with a better job and paid more"
good,"All in all, not a difficult place to work.  There is a little bit of pressure to do a lot more for the company on your own time - so work - life balance was difficult for me.  Educational benefits and training opportunities were there."
good,There is constant work and the days go by fast. The advantage of having many co-workers is gaining many friends. There are so many opportunities to advance into other positions through networking once you're inside the company.
good,"Management struggles to keep to their word when it comes to promoting from within and work/life balance.  Consistent manning shortages make job security a plus and the company will move you to a different area versus lay you off, which is better than some of their competitors."
good,Nice place to work would have liked to have stayed longer but Northrop Grumman bought another company and there was a duplicate positions and some positions were done away with.
good,"I worked offsite at a contractor site during my time with this company, so I don't too many things about how the company operates at the headquarters or onsite locations. There was not a lot of interactions with company management nor were the opportunities for growth made apparent."
good,At my most recent position I was never given the opportunity to learn all of the aspects of the PCA role.  Only alternative was to move to another PCA position.
good,"Pros: Name brand, established, reputable organization"
good,Good work/life balance depending upon the department.  Multiple locations will sometimes pay for relocation.  Holiday shut down in December for Corporate employees.  Will hire outside before promoting within.
good,NGC is a large company with many opportunities to expand your career. The company has acquired many smaller and large companies which make it possible to work in many locations and projects.
good,Great people that work there love them as family you have your good and bad days but more good then bad. Also management good enjoy working there but sometime you got to make changes in live to get where you wanna go.
good,"defense contractors make profit billing you out to feds.  they will keep you as long as the contract monies are flowing...once they stop, YOU ARE GONE...and they make no effort to help you transfer to another location.  you are on your own to try and get back with the company."
good,I only worked with Northrup Grumman as a contractor for 8 months before I was laid off but they gave me severance and health benefits for a month after I was gone. I was grateful for the position when I was hired and I had a great manager who aimed to keep me informed.
good,"Would like to go back, I like the type of work that Northrop offers to stay in high technology and front of industries. People are fun to work with and I love having every other Friday as off day."
good,"I left the company due to a reduction in force upon completion of software implementation of all units in the U.S. Army. Our project was to implement logistics enterprise software to manage maintenance, supply and financial management for all Army elements."
good,"Typical day is 9 - 10 hours long"
good,I have like working at NG however I am looking for a company closer to my home in palmdale.  The work loads are high however the management and peers work well together and value family and personal life
good,"If you want to be a ""company man"" this is a great place to do so, but expect to serve your time. If you are looking for rapid advancement or interesting and varying work, it might not be the best fit."
good,"Contractor for Northrop Grumman as a Network / Desktop repair tech.  Take call's, call users, Hardware and Software repair.. Some computer refresh and upgrades."
good,Northrop Grumman is a great company. Each site is unique in its management and treatment of employees. The St. Augustine site has been under a lot of pressure from corporate to treat its employees better and to improve its performance. The management was really struggling with this task. Management was very happy with my performance but they overextended their budget and had to let me go. I was disappointed but moved on.
good,"This is a good corporation to belong to. It provides great benefits and the corporation takes a strong interest in the employee's welfare. However, the local site struggles with competitive pay, a decent facility to work in, and overall weak or ineffective management. Specifically, intermediate management rewards/promotes bad behavior and  fails to recognize effective and potential strong leaders among their lower ranks. The poor management creates additional burdens which must be absorbed among the staff, in turn creating a poor work/life balance."
good,At the time I moved from Active Air Force in charge of the shop to temp hire as subordinate in the shop.  The person who was hired for the position was Guard placed on Active Duty for the Iraq war.  I knew he was returning and soon found permanent employment elsewhere.
good,"Upper level management does not seem to care about the 'average joe' doing the daily tasks. They seem to be more concerned about their bonuses and image. "
good,"Enjoyed working there for 32 years. The work was always challenging and interesting. In the early years the company was flexible to try new ideas and implementation as long as documented and reported. Like many large corporations they have become bogged down in over management, over reporting, over documentation and too much email communication which leaves the middle management and engineers with so much less time to get the effort done."
good,I was hired into Northrop Grumman into their Professional Development Program being told it was a high potential program but in actuality it was just a hiring tool. The program has potential but they haven't figured out the details of actually running it yet. What really makes a difference is the manager. I had a fantastic first manager but the the next 2 I experiences sexism and constant condescending attitudes.
good,"Working for Northrop Grumman has been a Great learning curve, On the down side Northrop Grumman could of spend more money on getting more tools that the mechanic could of used.  T"
good,"work was good, good management. People and coworkers were fun to work with and benefits were pretty good. Compensation was very poor for the area, would pay my worst enemy these wages"
good,"I liked working at Northrop thought I would make a career out of it but the druggy management in my dept was horrible, Literally smoked dope on lunch (not marijuana), kissed the behinds of new female employees would advance them without any experience and overlooked those that worked hard. They were liars, Found out that everyone was paid well over $5 more than I."
good,"Good company to work. Good exposure to technologies."
good,"Its  good office to join if you are not looking to advance and just need something stable. The dynamic is not like another office I have worked in. A great learning experience, and I work with some really great people. This office is the red headed step child of Northrop Grumman."
good,Found a lack of focus on projects frustrating.  A lot start/stop and a general desire for employees to just make it through the work day.  Not a motivating environment.
good,"To many meetings and constant upper management advances,"
good,Worked for several years at Xontech co bought out. Work was good. Hours were scheduled good. People good.
good,"General work day includes reviewing around 50 project schedules for complete and accurate timelines and milestones. Building project schedules with project managers. Facilitating weekly project status meetings, producing minutes afterwards. Complet weekly project schedule updates to ensure budget is correct and following timeline. Co-workers are great to work with and helpful if needed. The harderst part of the job comes at accounting month end getting all needed information to finance and accounting folks. enjoyable part of my job successfully closing out projects on time or ahead of schedule/"
good,Enjoyed my job on a daily basis. Upper management was never on the same sheet of music.
good,"Project leader in design and development of RF ATE station for testing of receiver front-end of AN/ALQ-162 airborne radar set. Effort included RF system analysis, defining test plan, writing major software device drivers, power and I/O Interface circuitry design and procurement of all components and document required to complete objective. Actively participated and directed four engineers and technical support team using minimal resources and under critical time constraints."
good,"Northrop Grumman closes the yard where I worked."
good,Schedule driven with Quality in mind.  Limited opportunities to learn different tasks.
good,"The group I work with makes it hard to advance and try other things. It's hard to get lab supplies or petty cash. Lots of time is wasted with IT restrictions. Our work is fast paced and is fun, but I don't make enough for what I do."
good,"You report to work same time everyday and do the same thing everyday.  Nothing different, nothing challenging or hard."
good,Great team of technician and engineers. Too many managers at the time.
good,Did not call back laid off positions but they hired new staff for the same position.at lower pay.
good,"I was shoved in last minute, so I don't blame them for me not having much to do. I spent most of my time making sure things were up to date on spreadsheets and doodling on sticky notes. Paid well though."
good,"Northrop Grumman has many good things about it. Very consistantly work, mostly competitive pay, ok opportunity to advance. I left because I maxed out the pay for my position and they said I was not eligible to promote for over a year."
good,Flexible work schedule. Most people work a 9/80 schedule where you are off every other Friday. There are an ample amount of roles and opportunities. Great place to work.
good,"Lots of hands-on and learning/growth opportunities. It's a big company. Just have to be patient in finding the right opportunity. "
good,Management takes notice to those with a drive. It is not difficult to be successful for those that are diligent and take pride in their work. Apply yourself and you will succeed.
good,"Great place to develop and grow in your career. I learned a lot of my time at Northrop, this was a great place to grow as an analyst and team player. Would highly recommend!"
good,"Northrop Grumman was a great place to work. It provided a learning environment that constantly challenged the intern team, exposing us to several methodologies/technologies."
good,I fully enjoyed working at Northrop Grumman.  I learned many different things from subcontracts to auditing to other government requirements.  The people there are the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,I learned a lot about supply chain in the national defense industry. The most enjoyable part of the job is the employees. I've also enjoyed the different activities that were provided for interns.
good,Nice place to work didn't like working with carbon fibers other than that it wasgood location was not the greatest----------‐‐------------------------
good,"Worked as a Senior Java Developer, management was good. There have proper process set up tp complete the projects. Do not different contractors with employee in sharing information required to accomplish the task"
good,"Never paid out of pocket for typical medical visits and prescriptions. Pay very competitive. Smart, hard working people, but very low ethics. If you don’t meet diversity qualifications, then butt kissing and sabotaging coworkers is the typical method for gaining an advantage come promotion time. You will be looked at sideways if you don’t stay at least 30 minutes per day late, but you do get paid straight time"
good,The company provides room for growth. Lots of smart people work here. Great perks working her. Great health benefits. Great time off. Great work/life balance. Great opportunities.
good,Mid level management was able to cultivate an environment that promoted growth and career advancement.  Did not like that the compensation was known for being low in certain positions.
good,"I was treated very well. I made Senior designerbin three years. After 13 years, I had four weeks of vacation. The company was very dedicated to training. I am proud to have been an employee."
good,"Overall, great company to work at if you're under a manager who fosters growth and empowers you to accomplish or exceed your responsibilities.  However if you're under a manager who has their own issues and therefore imposes micromanagement tactics, create roadblocks, conducts themselves in unethical behavior to dampen your success, it is best to find another position."
good,"Irrelevant.  I haven't worked there since 1994.  When the Berlin Wall fell and the Soviet Union dissolved, Congress cancelled the majority of production of the B2 bomber and 4500 workers lost their jobs including me."
good,"Amazing company with amazing co-workers. Management is short sited with their agenda as their goal. Pay is the very bottom of the industry standard, althy there is an effort to match industry minimum pay as a retention tool. Q to"
good,"Northrop Grumman is a great place to work as long as you totally understand ""hurry up and wait"""
good,"Typical government contractor work. Put in lots of work in hopes of winning next contract. During my time there, the government decided not to extend our contract, and the overall mood became depressed."
good,"As a whole the company is good to work for. Benefits are really good and they pay well, depending on the state you work. My supervision and managers within my program were okay. There seems to be some who are stuck in the past and fail to improve their processes."
good,"Many meetings with program(s) leadership on business performance, and security related issues. Environment is a secured environment that restricts free flow of communications and socializing."
good,"NG is a great company, decent pay, challenging work and great people. You ultimately decide when you go in and head home so great flexibility. I would recommend working here"
good,I enjoyed working there.  It was fun most of the time and most of the people got along with each other.  They would do games and giveaways which made for a nice environment.
good,"You can often get promoted to Team Lead or something similar. To go further, you would need to be in the right place at the right time and know the right people. This is probably true for most large companies."
good,"Offsite meeting at restaurant with management/employees."
good,"They had ping pong tables in some of the break areas at Northrop Grumman which made it feel like a fun place to work.  They also had an on-site gym, which was nice."
good,"12 hour days so it was long. But, we were treated fairly and it was a fun work environment. We had 4, 10 minute breaks and a 30 minute unpaid lunch. There were basketball hoops and ping pong tables that we could use."
good,"Everyday I learned a new skill from picking different parts, to cycle counting. Taking their job seriously and wanting the next person to perform at a high level to move forward in their career."
good,"I work with NGC as a contractor for the CDC, most jobs based in Atlanta are contract jobs for government agencies.  If you do not mind contract jobs then this is a great company - they have excellent benefits, a generous time-off plan and educational assistance."
good,"For the area i was in Management was all over the place but it was only in my department. HR didn't seem to know what was going on or they didn't care.  It is better to establish what you want out of the position before getting hired, that way there are no surprises. As far as the labs go its best to stay away from this area, not entirely sure its safe for ones health..."
good,"A good job, not for someone trying to do nothing.  For someone who is willing to work.  Northrop Grumman is a defense contractor, so it is a good opportunity to work on your clearance."
good,"I like my boss, he is trying to do his best for us is seems."
good,"If you're starting your career in engineering or want to do an internship during your engineering degree, this is a great place to get insight into potential careers and also have a major name on your resume."
good,Company has a great portfolio and great people. Work/life balance and diversity are highly valued. Commitment to the mission is what makes it a great place to work.
good,Very fast paced & dynamic. Lots of overtime with flexible shifts. Benifts are good or better than most companies. Prefer different work location than Edwards or California.
good,"Northrop Grumman is a huge company. As with any job, you primarily interact with a small group of about 15 people for the majority of your job. Any review will be reflected of that group, not the 85,000 whom work there. YMMV."
good,"The RM campus is very toxic. I love the work and my peers, but the MA leadership is terrible. Instead of all of the BU's working together, we've been separated and everyone is in silos. I was happy to finally work with very smart people and very smart engineers but the functional managers don't have a clue about what their team does; and can't help at all. You are reprimanded if you speak up and so many people just lay down and take the abuse. Other teams in SEIT are also forced to work 12 hour days even though they have families. When I originally interviewed I had a great manager and she defended me from all the dirt coming from up above; then there was a massive re-org and they moved me to another manager who only cares about herself. She takes people's work - erases their name and puts hers on there; claiming all the credit for the hard work done on METRICS presentations. I don't agree with this style of management and so I have to be careful with what I share or don't share. If I don't share; then that means I'm NOT ""collaborating with the team"". That's because after I put a ton of hours on BOEs or other work this woman erases my name and puts hers in there. Truly disgusting workplace. Don't come here if you don't like to play favorites and politics. I've never been in a more back stabbing environment; even LM was a lot better than this, too bad there's not a campus in IL."
good,I got to further my composites skills and learn about the aerospace industry. Can be a fun work environment. Good people. working with many new technologies
good,"Nothing good to say, nothing bad to say.  It was a job that paid fairly well for a summer internship and the work was neither notably interesting nor notably uninteresting."
good,"Most of the staff were friendly and competent. The work environment was pleasant, too. The only problem I faced was the management, located in Boulder, CO. It was distant and ineffective."
good,Management and employees where great to work with. I had a great group of employees reporting to me. Sometimes management would provide lunch. Very strong on safety.
good,Benefits in line with the other major aerospace companies.  Since most employees have worked in another aerospace company things operate just about the same as the other big companies.
good,"Didn't play an important role on the projects i was involved in, even though it was an internship position kinda felt that they were just herding ppl in to replace all the retire age engineers. Chill company with good pay and benefits but there's no real sense of drive or passion at the company. Wish they would've provided me with more opportunities or managers that actually cared"
good,I worked fat an external customer site my entire time working for Northrop Grumman and I would have liked more engagement with the internal team members to have a better opportunity to compete for expanded or advanced roles.
good,Money could be better for a company that makes billions every year and getting any help from supervision is basically non-existent. But the coworkers made it a better experience.
good,"Highly technical and accountable with a good management structure and supportive functional staff. Decisions made at lowest possible level, enabling empowerment at all levels."
good,good place to work and thrive.  co workers are friendly and always help you learn. good opportunity to learn and grow. good salary and also you have to work on multiple things which help to increase your knowledge in different areas.
good,"Northrop hires high-achievers.  It is not easy to get into the company. As a result, a typical day is dynamic, active and you have to be flexible and be able to Pivot. I grew exponentially at Northrop, their support for growth in technical areas is phenomenal.  Any area of technology you might want to explore is available to you. The workplace culture is divine, it provides volunteer opportunities in many areas, employee resource groups that do many things such as hiking, boating, art, etc.  The diversity is a picture of the globe and women are supported in their career growth.  The hardest part of the job is the disconnect between executive management goals and the goals of the middle managers.  While the Executive managers see employees as their number one asset, the middle managers have not quite caught on and sometimes do not manage work in a manner that employees have a healthy work balance. Some of them are also not customer focused making the job of those who are a little difficult. The most enjoyable has been the ability to be introduced to new technologies and having a seat up front in the emerging technologies such as AI and machine learning.  And the outlet to give back in the volunteer opportunities is over the top enjoyable."
good,"The organization has great checks and balance, when people excute them.  Job was fulfilling.  I was able to help employees obtain answers to questions regarding the company.  Employees made it rewarding and enjoyable."
good,"Good company.  A lot of older engineers from the westinghouse days are still there, but the younger employees are on the rise. If your looking for a place to grow this is a good company."
good,"Northrop Grumman has loads of potential for those looking for stability and long-term employment. If you can get past the slow nature of business decisions, you can manage a solid career."
good,Productive work environment. Proffesional and team oriented. Positive work ethics. Career building and motivational surroundings with plenty of growth.
good,"I really enjoyed being part of one of the largest IT teams of any company I have ever worked for. The company is driven by Technology and Aerospace. The culture was great, supportive and I leaned a lot about integrity, values and stewartdship."
good,"NGC has realigned its focus to reduce costs; focus on new business which is in line with core competencies and improve profitability.  It has been successful on all of those fronts.  As a result, there is new growth in many areas of the enterprise.  New growth creates new challenges."
good,"Great place to work, competitive pay, lots of room to advance for those who are willing to put in the work and take on tasks that are thrown your way."
good,"Great working my co-workers.  At times was a lot of stress, but we all well together as a team.  Sea trials were rather hard at times but very rewarding once completed."
good,"I enjoyed my time working for Northrop, they treated me will.  The pay and benefits were both good, and they supported us in our self-development goals."
good,"quick pace some very friendly people. congfi,inventory great place to work. You can learn alot enjoy wonderful people. be apart of something really wonderful."
good,My typical day was relaxed and fun. I learned a lot as an intern and I had a lot of exposure to things I had never tried before. My coworkers were fantastic and I always felt lie I was doing relevant and useful work.
good,"I haven't work for NG in a long time, but I do have fond memories of working there, and having to solve real math problems.  "
good,"Northrop Grumman is a great company with advanced and critical products that allow employees to learn and advance."
good,Take applicants biometrics who are scheduled hourly for immigration purposes. the culture here is great and everyone works here as a team. Here I learned various immigration laws and procedures.
good,Unfortunately the work/life balance is not great at Northrop. Expectation is to work extra hours at no pay as most employees are salaried. Upper management lacks the necessary ability to people manage.
good,Great place to work. Very competitive and professional environment. Great pay and benefits. Great place to work for long term job. Family oriented environment.
good,Great place to work but work life balance is lacking. If you work for this company you will be expected to travel at a moments notice and make the company/customers mission your top priority.
good,Lots of interesting projects to work on but a lot of times the complicated levels of management prevent productivity. A lot of people are great to work with but the company is in a midst of a transition as a new generation comes in that challenges the way of doing things.
good,"I was doing electronics drafting there and it is a great group to work with.  It was a very good experience, and a good company to work for as well.  I lived close by also which was a plus."
good,"Management isn't the best and a TON of political BS. But if you can deal with the BS, its really not a bad place to work.  Can be really relaxed or extremely stressful."
good,"Experience varied depending on sub-group.  Even within a group, changes in management and personnel impacted experience more than anything. Its about the people, and in my experience - mostly good people.  "
good,Stressful employment environment.  Well paid for that stress level.  Good workplace environment (co-workers were excellent)  Learned many skills on the job.
good,they arrange people by projects. So sometime you might need work in long commuter location since you are sent to different project. if there is a long term project. That would be good place to stay.
good,"The contract came to an end, otherwise I would have stayed.  I was not able to relocate to another state under the redeployment process. The environment was very good to work in."
good,"Northrop Grumman was an excellent company to work for, but often there was a disconnect between Corporate and the operating sectors. It was difficult to advance, as well."
good,"Overall it is a decent company to work for. If you are not working at one of their main locations or out in the field so to speak, you are pretty much an outcast."
good,"Longevity can occur. But large culture of cronyism as the vehicle of mobility vs. merit.  Entrepreneurial spirit can have success.  But lots of having to figure it out as you go.  Overall, a good company."
good,"A great team of engineers were recruited to implement DFARS compliance to Northrops multitude of environments. Clearly upper management did not due their due diligence in initiating the project as it constantly changed, then after 7 months funding was ultimately pulled leaving everyone abruptly out of work. It was a great 7 months of paid cybersecurity training in DFARS."
good,"Good to work 9/80 work schedule and have every Friday off that are 26 pay day off in a year. Has many women in all level of management. Nice and 50 acre campus in nice Warner Center area. Fairly good job security and good benefits of medical, dental insurance and 401K retirement plan."
good,Very strong and high performing Aerospace Company.  Focus on diversity and changing workforce.  Strong senior leadership and a very strategic thrust on performance.
good,NGAS is a great place to work. Lot's of room for growth and opportunities. You can change jobs fairly easily if you want to try something new. Good pay.
good,Management was rather profit and schedule driven. The company has taken on a different view of AAS degreed people. Very demanding on amount of hours worked.
good,"9/80 work week with overtime on day and evening shifts, I learned how to operate high end test equipment and test setups as well as test processing of fabricate modules.  Workplace competitive and at times stressful, management suspect depending on department"
good,"My review is somewhat skewed because my immediate boss was just terrible.  Absolutely zero people skills, unabashedly kneeled at every request from his boss and desecrated all below him.  Without this deplorable manager (who should have long benefited), my review would be very positive, especially senior management (i.e., CEO, CFO, and my Division SVP).  All were outstanding."
good,The benefits and pay are the highest in the market. The organization and support is very strong. Opportunities to advance in your field are very achievable with minimal effort.
good,It was a great place to work for 18 years. When my contract ran out the HR department was supposed to provide help in finding another job in the company. I guess they were to busy to help me.
good,I work at a field site which is atypical.  The atmosphere there is very relaxed.  The main Northrop Grumman facilities are little more hectic.  There is a more cut throat culture where people are always looking for a charge number to bill there time.  Which is lame.
good,"i think the internal hiring practice is very flawed, applying for other positions is the only way to get advanced in the company. No encouragement or promotions are offered the only way you can receive a promotion is appying to other sections."
good,"Over 20 years of maintenance (including instructor) background.  Was told that I was listed as the ""worst technician"" because I was the only one who's ego could handle it.  Was also given a raise shortly after.  Was transferred and told I was getting Leadership position.  Found out it was a two man operation and they put me in as Software Engineer (I had never been software trained.)"
good,I worked for them overseas as a contractor. I don't really know a lot about the company. I choose to come home at the end of my contract. Tried to find a job stateside with them and was unable to.
good,"Your quality of experience will depend on which site, program, team, and manager you have. It's that varied. You can transfer to another spot if you don't like your placement, but I prefer to leave the company entirely."
good,"It gets really hectic, but is nevertheless a great company.  There are lots of growth opportunities.  There is a big generation gap, as with most of the aerospace companies in the area."
good,"NGC is a very nice and exciting company to work with."
good,"My experience will vary from others as I am a contractor working on a customer project, but Northrop has treated me very well.  There are pros and cons for working for such a large company but by and large they offer numerous opportunities from advancement to training and relocation.  They also emphasize employee feedback and have been making an effort of late to actively monitor each and every comment made."
good,"Manufacturing sheetmetal"
good,"The NGC mission is to keep America safe and strong. It is inspiring!"
good,"I worked in the position as an IT. I like my work place because I have worked in a professional and friendly environment.  Everyone in the office is friendly and wants you to succeed."""
good,"Work duties are great working with different people and learning the growing technology.  Management is stressful, consent  change and never satisfied."
good,"Each project varies with the speed of the tasks. Managers vary in skill and the people vary as well. The most enjoyable part of the job was definitely the people.  However, there was a lack of younger people and the average age was in their mid 40s to 50s."
good,"This position was taken as part of a rotation opportunity. It was a great first job to have to learn the ins and outs of an accounting calendar, and establish relationships with suppliers."
good,"I was in college and had a great co-op opportunity. I was given real work and learned things. I did go to grad school after, instead of taking a job there... but I will be re-applying."
good,"I worked long and hard, but when the time came, I was laid-off.  Management set me up to fail so that I would be laid-off.  The work was very stressful at times prior to my layoff."
good,"Work hours are reasonable; Managers Team put more focus on themselves than the employees."
good,"More than half of the work force here are retirement age and they have legacy knowledge which needs to be passed onto the next generation, but it seems like the young newly hired people don't stay. Union people are hard to work with."
good,"hrough his portrayal in Plato's dialogues, Socrates has become renowned for his contribution to the field of ethics, and it is this Platonic Socrates who lends his name to the concepts of Socratic irony and the Socratic method, or elenchus. The latter remains a commonly used tool in a wide range of discussions, and is a type of pedagogy in which a series of questions is asked not only to draw individual answers, but also to encourage fundamental insight into the issue at hand. Plato's Socrates also made important and lasting contributions to the field of epistemology, and his ideologies and approach have proven a strong foundation for much Western philosophy that has followed."
good,good place to start your career but growth is slow. there are many opportunities to learn about engineering careers and how to apply your skills within industry.
good,"Great place to start out.  When I worked there the Huntington Ingalls shipyard was then Northrop Grumman. It had good benefits, would pay reimbursement for successful completion of college courses."
good,"A stable company to wok for. Good environment. Friendly co-worker."
good,"Traveled constantly for this position. Could not have any sort of home or social life continuity.  The first line manager could not get all employees to do the daily job requirements (showing up on time, taking only one hour for lunch).  He would let all this pass."
good,"Many Work Groups, Fast paced, very progressive management team. You will have to find ways to expand yourself and your network. Customer satisfaction is a great part of the job, knowing you helped make it happen."
good,"Great company to work for if you love aerospace. However the company is still archaic in its processes and beliefs, a byproduct of old aerospace. The company prides itself of technological innovation but refuses to innovate the work force or processes. As a government contractor compensation is higher in many other places."
good,Good environment and work place. More trust worthy and competitive. Good colleagues  and managers team. High work statisfaction. good work culture to work
good,"Treated me good. I performed a first-rate job. Help save NG money. Security Bad, considering the quality of work and money Company saved from my employment."
good,"Each day brings a new challenge.  Many of the employees are willing to share knowledge to achieve common goal of protecting company networks, personal information, and work documents."
good,"I worked at NG on the VITA/COV project. This project was somewhat negative in that all three major entities (NG, VITA, State agencies) distrusted and disliked one another which made meetings, strategy and planning extremely tedious and painful."
good,I enjoyed working at Northrop Grumman. The work was challenging and interesting. Management was helpful and communicated well. My colleagues were friendly and helpful.
good,I enjoyed working there. Wish the company was more involved in the community especially in the Oklahoma City Area. Good job security depending on the program.
good,Leader in cutting edge technology. Very Large and continues to grow. Well structured and organized. Can transition to any other job or position as desired.
good,"Overall, Northrop Grumman is a wonderful place to work. Site specific issues, but they do have excellent areas of personal growth and assistance programs"
good,"Review Work package for job assignment, speak to management for the ok, partner up, go to work. learn a lot from the older experienced workers. The heat, tight working area, climbing, has to be the hardest part off the job. Finishing the job, passing inspections is the most enjoyable part."
good,"Very good work environment for electronic engineering,  but not business disciplines.  Has high turn over among younger generation.   Systems are very buricratic and slow to react."
good,Very top heavy in management due to being part of the Defense Contractor System. I left for other reasons. I was satisfied with my career there.
good,"Typical day is 8 - 10 hours depending on the cycle of the program."
good,Good Company with work life balance. Lot of potential to grow and management is really helpful. Co-workers are helpful and freindly. I learned a new technology and there is a scope to learn a lot.
good,Older generation culture stuck in old ways. Trying to make changes to attract new younger talent. Promotions are often based on previous military service leaving civilians out to dry.
good,A typical day at work involves the processing of various forms of information. I have learned how to use the SAP system to complete daily transactions. My manager ensures that we keep a open line of communication to keep the work environment running smooth. My coworkers work closely together to complete the job on a step by step basis. The hardest part of the job is keeping everyone happy at all times. What I enjoy most about the job is being in the position to manage my own time.
good,"I was hired to work on night vision. we set up the test sets and procedures. then they packed us up and sold us. Sold us to L3 ,bate and switch, I wanted to work for Northrop."
good,"Good place to learn about different parts of the organization through rotations. For recent grads, the rotational PDP program is a good start to a career."
good,"I know this is a great company to work for but I was brought in as a contract employee. After working there for over 2 years, I was still a contract employee, never received a raise in pay or benefits. That aside, I did enjoy working there. I was a part of a great team that did great things."
good,Great company to work for. do their best to take care of the workers on the floor. Very organized. Provide everything you need to be successful.
good,"Northrop Grumman is (in my opinion) the best aerospace company in the world. The systems are incredible. "
good,"Northrop Grumman is a leading DoD contractor offering many opportunities within the corporate environment.  It is a conservative, hard working place where highly complex programs are developed."
good,Great workplace environment.  Company protects jobs very well.  Easy to move around and find new opportunities within the company
good,"Performed general maintenance and repair of equipment such as shooting targets and buildings requiring practical skill and knowledge in such trades as painting, carpentry, plumbing, masonry, and electrical work."
good,"A great company to work for with great benefits, full medical, dental and vision coverage, as well as 401k with company match. Decent work environment in a climate controlled building."
good,All the people working on the site were very enjoyable to work with and it was a great experience to further my experience in aircraft quality inspection. Only issue was there were frequent layoffs which made everyone insecure.
good,"if you like what you are doing and your pay is acceptable to you, it is a place for you.  if you want to do more, it is not the place to work for you and grow"
good,"Great people to work with the projects were always challenging."
good,Gained my UNIX sysadmin experience here.  Great experience.  Interesting people I worked with.  Management did not micro-manage which was great.
good,"There is a lot of pride knowing that the products you are producing are helping support the war fighter.  Everyone works together for a common cause and goal.  One Team, One mission"
good,Coworkers are great and everyone is very helpful. Strong ream environment in the engineering department. Upper level management has re-orged several times leading to an uncertain future for OU.
good,"Some people love it here, others hate it. Pay is fair, opportunities for advancement are above average. Engineers run the show though. If you're not an engineer you'll occasionally feel like a second class citizen. But all in all, its very possible to find a comfortable niche working with good people and you can make a decent living, enjoy your work, put in a few decades, and retire comfortably some day. Lots of people have done just that. Very common to see people put in 30+ years and retire."
good,"Lots of firedrills.   Every day.    High-performing group of people.   Lots of bureaucracy.   "
good,Good place to work. Upward mobility within the company is a plus.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with a great group of people!
good,"My typical work day would start with me working on whichever unit I was assigned to loft for the new aircraft carrier, the Ford. These drawings were modeled in CATIA and then pulled over to a computer program where fabrication documents for the waterfront were created. My primary job was lofting structure, which in short meant welding thickness and beveling on the T-bars/bulkheads per procedures for each of the thicknesses of the bars. I learned much from those around me as well as my supervisor, whom was very team oriented and driven. My coworkers were mostly men, which could be difficult at times, but very much a learning experience. They were all very experienced in their jobs and were excellent in helping me learn the job. The most difficult part of the job was making sure that the drawings were correct. If they were incorrect and something made it past the planners and to the waterfront, it could potentially be a severe problem for those building the ship and ultimately cause a work stoppage. The most enjoyable part of my job was knowing that I was helping build a ship that would protect our country for decades to come."
good,Great benefits and co-workers are very helpful. Hardest part of the job is being away from family for so long while on a contract.
good,I enjoyed working with everyone. It was amazing to see how nice people actually were besides the fact that most people were quiet.
good,Northrop Grumman is an organized business that has lots of hard working people.  This company meets and exceeds the expectations of its employees.

good,"With the right management, growth is possible. Customers are good. Work has its ups and downs with some contracts being more active than others."
good,"I enjoyed the time there as a high school student, but the work that needed to be done with my skill level was not too exciting nor challenging. Other schools participated, but students in the morning session had the most opportunities to do projects and had mentors who weren't exhausted from the day's work. However, at the end of the day, it was a good opportunity to be exposed to the engineering world."
good,I worked at NGC for over twenty years in two different stints. I really enjoyed my first encounter and felt like part of a large family. During the second stint I felt there were lots of company politics and large company bureaucracy.
good,"Northrop Grumman had good benefits but there was no advancement, and no advance warning that the contract was being terminated"

good,Northrop Grumman is run like a typical large institution with a very vertical hierarchical structure. The demographic is mainly tilted towards more baby boomers than millenials.

good,"Excellent organization with brilliant engineers, all employees work together for the good of the organization."
good,"You got a list of Items that were hottest.  You would go to your lead tech who would get your item.  You would review the field techs information on what was wrong and proceed from there.  You would check out a folder with all pertinent information and in some cases proceed with the testing by ""cookbook"" (procedures in testing in an orderly fashion written by the engineers) fashion until a fault appeared. You would go from there in a logical fashion to isolate the fault, remove it, replace it, and retest.  Sometime the fault did not present itself and then the tech would do some things that would help reveal the fault."
good,"Work from 5am-2:30 pm, in my position I work on anything from machining flight hardware to transporting material from building to building. I have learned how to operate CNC and conventional mills, as well as CNC and conventional lathes. I have done some assembly work in the highbay and other locations across Northrop. Management can be a little self-serving at times, and difficult to deal with, but in the end they are nice people. I have made a lot of pretty good friends working here. I would say that the hardest part of my job would be waking up at 4am to make sure I am at work on time, while the most enjoyable part would be getting off at 2:30 pm, and having every other Friday off."
good,"•	Write, rewrite, develop, and edit technical manuals for military and commercial use utilizing multiple software applications  to include ARs, TMs, MWOs, RPSTLs, MACs, MIL Specifications and Preferences, Technical Bulletins, IETMs, and DIDs, as well as commercial publications."
good,"I've learned how a big project can be broken down to small pieces and accomplished as a team. Mid-level management can be very supportive & provide the help required to complete each task.

good,"Overall good place to work, with end of year holiday shut down."
good,Solid work life balance encouraging employees involvement.
good,"As I said in a previous review, this employer is great with opportunities, salary, and benefits.  Government contracting is just an icy slope that you never know how it's going to go."
good,"I truly enjoyed the opportunities I was given while working with Northrop Grumman.  Not only that, but the pay and benefits were great as well.  Government contracting is just such a ""iffy"" business to be in and the buy-outs, divisions, etc can be scary when it comes to job security!"
good,Northrop Grumman @ Fort Polk is a good place to work.  My title is Warehouse Specialist but I process more administrative work than warehouse.  The upper management here tends to be clickish.  I enjoy my job and helping the soliders.
good,I have worked for this company for the pass 2.5 years as contract labor and have enjoyed the two programs that I have worked on and have enjoyed most everyone that I have worked with and I have also learned that half of supervision needs more training in some areas to better inform the mechanics that work under their supervision.
good,"I am a mechanic for Northrop Grumman and i work on track vehicles at Ft Irwin, Ca."
good,"I really liked working for this company. The benefits were great, the employees have become friends."
good,"I am currently the scrum master, and functional lead, for a software development team for Northrop Grumman.  I have learned a lot since I started.  We are definitely on the forefront of pushing for agile in government contract life.  Our development process highly utilizes pair programming, test driven design, and continuous integration.  I enjoy my colleagues, and value what they bring to the team.  The most difficult part of my job is dealing with multiple high priority issues, with a limited number of resources."
good,"Northrop Grumman, as a company seemed to have great leadership.  The southern shipyards however, lacked in that area."
good,Work is interesting and important and challenging. The teams are small and productive. Excellent opportunities for advancement.
good,A typical day work working at Northrop is like know other place. Working with great people and being on great teams are the most enjoyable part about working at Northrop. I'm self motivated and all i need is the assignment and the job will get done on time.
good,"A typical day of work was hard work and a lot of movement with different things to do like troubleshooting, reading blueprints.  Work as a team, military management. My co-workers were from different races, the hardest part was pulling heavy cables and the most enjoyable part was working on the navigation system area."
good,I've worked with this company for 10 years and every department I've worked with has been very different from the next.  Although most days are incredibly busy each team member has always been truly dedicated to completing our mission and getting the job done.

good,Folks work  hard there. Dependent upon Air Force project funding.

good,"Northrop Grumman is a highly competitive, team-focused company."
good,"Northrop Grumman is a very good, solid place to work for system engineers, hardware engineers, software programmers and test engineers"

good,"It was a contact position.  They lost the contact, so that was the end of the job."
good,"Northrop Grumman has given me all the opportunity in the world, and helped me develop skills necessary to be successful.  People make a business successful and Northrop Grumman has great people."
good,Wonderful company to work for. The talent is great to be around. Also the productivity is unmatched.
good,Some of the hardest design due to tight spaces. The naval contracts are very indepth with a multitude of aspects to the design.
good,"Same as Longview Inc. This was the first job where I had direct contact with customers and I fell right into it. At the time of being hired I had been out the work force for about ten years due to retirement. I was hired with a twenty-three year old, thought how in the world would this work out. It did perfectly, we remain friends to this day."
good,"Top talent, great teamwork, excellent reputation with customers. Great local management team. Local management recognizes and rewards excellent work."
good,Lots of work to be done. Wonderful management. Wonderful coworkers. Unfortunate that the parent company doesn't see the need to match industry wide salary standards.
good,My time here was very educational.  The tools are in place to develop the Industrial workforce.  The opportunities for advancement are available but the compensation is less attractive.
good,This a very good company to work for. Hope I can work for this company again.
good,"Worked at NG for only a short time, devoted to the development of proposal for DARPA."
good,everyday it was something new and exciting the work environment was very professional and the hardest part of the job was the long hours sometimes
good,Exciting innovative technology and applications for public health.
good,"The job is the same as USIS, just a different company. The people are friendly and the job is very good."
good,Fun place with lots to learn about PC's and different network configurations.
good,"Good company to work for. Great Benefits. It big and departmentalize, so you get stuck doing the same thing all day without the opportunity to see other things. I left because it was too far, not because I didn't like the company."
good,"The company was fine. Northrup Grumman (NG) acquired it from a small company buyout. It was better before because we given a lot of attention. When NG bought it, we were just a very small operation in their big picture and were often neglected. The operation eventually went civil service and NG is no longer in the picture."
good,"NG, like most government contractors right now is going through a downsizing phase. Our team is having to take on more with less manpower. I will say that NG has created such a team environment that our smaller team has all worked hard and pulled together to commit to getting the job done. NG I feel has one of the best benefits packages that any company could offer."
good,Ingalls is a very good place to work and get the experience in a marine field.
good,High stress environment; great co-workers; very good management support
good,"Lots of projects to have the opportunity to work on. Primarily DoD based contracts that can be long or short term, depending on the specific government customer. Excellent work place conditions, salary and benefits."

good,"Lots of travel, highly experienced work force. Everyday had a different challange to overcome."
good,"I was only there a short time, and I was only a developer, which was very different for me after leading a team for the previous 5 years.  I was used to a higher pressure job, and felt bored at times, although the rest of the team thought I was very productive.  I learned some new technologies, and taught a few teammates some new skills as well."
good,"As an Oracle DBA for Northrop Grumman, a typical day starts with running through morning checks on OEM, querying the Dba_Jobs table and checking the deferred transaction queue. After correcting any conflicts or hung processes, I check the alert logs for unusual activity or Oracle errors. Throughout the day, I check Oracle processor usage and disk space. "
good,Northrop Grumman has enabled me to learn throughout my 16 years with the company.  I was able utilize the engineering skills acquired in college and transition into productive skills in the workplace.  Northrop Grumman enabled me to transition into a program management role as a deputy and offered PMP training to become a more competent and more efficient PM.  The most enjoyable part of the job was building a team and working together for a common goal.  Participating in workforce engagement activities further strengthened the team to perform at even higher levels.
good,The company attempts to make everyone feel welcome and needed. Unformtuantly the current state of the Defence industry has put proessure on the company to downsize.
good,Friday off; Learned to do a SW config Management. Friendly co-workers

good,"Drilled fastener holes in aluminum and titanium parts using an automatic, freon cooled drill. Fastened the components together with rivets and other fasteners. Cut bent and coupled hydraulic lines. Built Canon plug, electrical connectors and wiring harnesses for thrust reverser systems on Gulfstream G4 and Fokker F100 aircraft. I never did riveting before. I moved to the hydraulic/electrical assembly shop. Local management was fine. Some businesses seem to view their employees as just a part of an overall equation and not as people with families."
good,"A typical day was receiving parts, inputting received parts into the computer system and then working with expediters to disburse needed parts for specific airplanes being built"
good,Learned a lot about state agencies and the world of IT. I really have nothing more to say
good,There isn't a great work relationship between contractors and civilians.
good,Northrop Grumman is a great place to work. They have a strong commitment to excellence for both their customers and shareowners. The benefits that they extend to today's workforce are second to none.

good,"NG is adament about maintaining CMMI Level 5 certification, and use of the 6-Sigman processes."
good,"Flexible work scheduling with good benefits, education assistance, etc. Challenges are ever present to keep people active and engaged. Disjointed connection between management and production floor, however."
good,"After morning maintenance meeting, we make sure aircraft are ready for the days flight schedule."
good,I really enjoyed my my daily functions and carreer opportunities that where part of my job scope.
good,Great place to work with excellent colleagues. Always challenging environment that will constantly keep you on your toes.
good,I was assigned in Iraq with this company. Comapred to other companies they seem to have more support with any questions or issues employees had.
good,"High technology, set for the future to be the number 1 in national and world security, competitive, values are set towards its customers, shareholders and employees."
good,I think this is a great company to work for. They are very versitile with a lot of invative avenues to travel. If they were in the area that I live now I would certainly want to work for them again
good,Overall NG is a great place to work. this location stabablity is questionable.
good,Very conscientious on employee retention which can equate to job security. Management is understanding and personable to its employees. There is room for growth within this company if your work justifies it.
good,"Great benefits,with great oppurtunites for upward mobility."
good,Fair and rewarding and very fast paced work environment.  Management needs more skill in helping employees to achieve there goal. Job and contracting company have break down in communication.
good,"All depends on what program you work for, some programs have tons of overtime mandatory and old tech, while others are totally the opposite. Culture is you have to switch roles to get promoted."
good,"Northrop used to have a pension, no more.  They are a huge company.  Not a lot of training support there.  Some areas are a lot better than others.  I don't recommend working there to start your career."
good,"Northrop Grumman is a good outfit. ... In any case, Northrop is a career company. If you can work for them, it will not always be fun and there will be a fair measure of internal bureaucracy but it's going to be a forever job if you want it. And you can advance internally."
good,"Employees are very kind and helpful... caring each other and make sure they have the tool they needs."
good,"Good work environment "
good,"I enjoyed working there, great work schedule, but the pay in my area was a little weak.  I left due to salary.   A great company, with a great mission.  They prize engineers, unfournately I am not one, a great company with a very important mission nonetheless."
good,I would cut down the favoritism. Seniority is not important anymore. That is one of the many reasons that I left. Confidentiality is a must but management can't seem to keep things professional.
good,"I would definitely recommend seeking employment with Northrop Grumman. I thoroughly enjoyed my work, it was very satisfying and I was excited to go to work each day."
good,"The company I first contracted with was acquired by Northrop Grumman 30 days after I started. I was brought in for the acquisition transition and have enjoyed the work and the environment.  My manager has been flexible with my start time, which I greatly appreciate."
good,For the most part working for this company was great! The benefits were good & it was really felt like a team. You also after your 6 month probation period start to recruit PTO every paycheck & can begin to use it. Also after your probationary period you have chances to bid on different jobs with higher pay. Though like most jobs still had its cons; When I was leaving a new manager came in on a power trip and was changing everything. There’s A LOT of overtime which if you like money is great but it is hard to keep a social life outside of work. Another thing that is tricky is their point system. They want you to report injuries but yet if you’re injured and/or sick and they send you home they point you.
good,A fun place to work that requires dedication and attention to detail. Management dedication to culture and growth. The most enjoyable part about this job is the satisfaction of working in an environment that is always dealing with the future.
good,"Good company to work for. I have no complaints. A little old school when it comes to day to day operations, but overall not a bad company to work for, at all."
good,"good work environment"
good,Not a bad place to work. Average work environment to slightly hectic. Plan to work a lot of hours. Management can be difficult as it changes frequently.
good,"my situation was generally good - I was a consultant, working on a new classified air force program - there were pros and cons"
good,Good place to work.  Salary was competitive although advancement opportunities were limited. Job duties were well defined and expectations were clearly understood.  Opportunity to work with cutting edge technology and participate in the development of emerging technologies.
good,"Northrop Grumman is a great place to work with strong benefits and competitive salaries.  However, it needs to focus on changing the culture and management."
good,"First you are not compensated at prevailing wage, you barely make half of what prevailing wage is. Cost of living raise each year is only 3% and that's it. no performance reward. Safety first and quality first is BS it's about production which is constantly slowed by lack of parts and postal sandbagging of items to be repaired and postal constantly threatens to pull the contract great place but be ready for full time BS. Techs are nit picked and held to higher standard than engineers and management. Most immediate supervisors are good with the exceptional jerks. Too many bums get away with slacking while hard workers expected too pick up slack. NG bs about ethics, something they fail to practice themselves. Won't stand up for employees and kiss postal tail on a daily basis. Engineers are incompetent and have no respect for techs who make things work. We generate the revenue but are rewarded the least."
good,"Typically you are expected to do whatever operations demanded.  I worked in quality as an Ultrasonic inspector and as quality should be set for making sure the parts are in good condition, operations sure expected us to blow through parts as fast as they wanted.  Supervisors don't get along with each very well, which made it hard to work with anyone in other departments."
good,"My position included many varied activities which I enjoyed, great co-workers, stress due to short deadlines, lots of company sponsored activities including fairs and food trucks"
good,"As a member of Test Design Engineering, you're able to learn a lot as long as you make yourself available - several projects need help. Management and coworkers are friendly enough, although people may sometimes throw you under the bus."
good,I enjoyed working at this company for ten years u fortunately as time progressed there became funding problems for the security department. So major cut backs ! Not to mention the poor management within the security department. Not the company as a whole.
good,"very compartmentalized"
good,"I started at this company as soon as I got out of college. The company has a lot of programs and opportunities for the higher ups to take notice of you. However, Northrop likes to promote based on tenure instead of merit. It's very hard to get level increases if you haven't been here for a certain amount of time which can seriously hold you back if you don't know the right people to force it through or if the program would completely crumble if you left it."
good,"I went to work and sat around until we were given a notification to proceed to our next training site, depending on who you were meant where you went.  Management was just trying to fly under the radar, the quarterly performance reviews were clearly all an after thought of how well you performed out training the students, and didn't have bad critiques from them.  Numerous trainers performed below standards but the company continued to send them as they need bodies to get through the fielding based on time not quality."
good,Currently going through transition period. Not certain what the future holds at this time. Know there will be some changes. People are dedicated and take pride in what they do. Great industry to be a part of.
good,"I was the most qualified boat technician, yet the manager chose to advance an employee that had been working for the company less than a year and had less qualifications.  Also discriminated against me for a injury that happened in the work place.  Manager told me the only way I would be advanced was if I max out the pay as a level 2 technician."
good,"Decent pay, very rewarding in my current job.The location of my current job is not someplace i want to live anymore. The company is known for stability, never layoff, but the pay is middle of the road for this industry."
good,Enjoyable place to work where veterans are used to train active-duty and current service-members in the use of computerized missile defense systems. Compensation and benefits were great.
good,"Northrop Grumman is a good employer. The company allowed $11,000 per year to get a degree or obtain certifications, but sometimes managers would limit funding for training and certifications."
good,Northrop Grumman encouraged me to become more than a programmer. During my time with them I completed my masters degree. I also refined my ability to write Requirements.
good,"Good place to work for old guys, can use my experience without the stress allows for as much as one can feel he or she can do without the severe pressure of critical jobs. Supervisor are professional and relate well to workers. Its great to work with active duty military and feel I am still contributing to the nation's security without the  hardships and danger of real combat."
good,"Contracting is extremely competitive and although the uncertainty of a continued position after the contract has reached its term is very stressful, I could never have worked with a better qualified, supportive and ""family"" oriented team!"
good,"Good place to work.  Rewards open minded effective personal- major defense contractor with room for growth. I felt leadership did a fair job of development with employees, sustained employment Is based on the individual."
good,Spent many years working for Northrop Grumman. Had an opportunity to add to my professional skill set so I switched jobs. Overall great company to work for.
good,Large company with lots of opportunities however management varies and its easy to get lost in the company. No annual bonuses and promotions/raises are tricky. Nice technology. Work culture is not fun due to government regulations. tons of opportunity within the company.
good,"I worked for Vinnell Arabia in Riyadh, KAS. Very good people to work with could have ued more days off for vacation. The pay was alright but not where it should have been, or I may have stayed."
good,"It's a great place to work. You can learn a lot here, as well as move to different jobs within the company to fit you. Plenty of room to grow within this company. Day to Day operations get tiring with not having the right equipment to get the job done."
good,The experience was great. Learned a tons. Loved the product that I worked on. Most of the people were brilliant. People respected me and my position. Not much chance for advancement.
good,"Manufacturing rocket motors is an interesting business. The pay and benefits are above average.  The culture has been harsh due to past leadership and layoffs, but they are trying to improve the culture.  It is government contracting with lots of government oversight."
good,"Worked overseas for there subsidiary company Vinnell Arabia. Pay was ok, new management they brought in was terrible. The guys name was HUB and he treated everyone like they were back in the military and did the entire babysit game while people were trying to work."
good,answered emails to get status of payments for vendors.This was done by flagging emails by distributing them evenly among staff. Cleared box usually by end of day.
good,"A typical day involves 15 minutes work planning to determine priorities and follow through on pending action items."
good,"Where I was working have lots of personnel problem and they were trying reorganization a few times to finally force out my (bad) manager. It took about two years. I wish I knew my managers will be force out before I quit the job. "
good,"Northrop Grumman primary provides resources to the United States government. I worked in USPS sector. Northrop Grumman treated me well, providing very good benefits and a fair salary"
good,"I was an independent contractor (sub) to Northrup Grumman. My review has little to do with the company as a whole. Therefore, this review should not be considered."
good,"Great place if you already have career experience. The system engineering culture does not allow much design at a low level for electrical engineers. Work here, its not a bad place."
good,Tired of constantly putting out fires and not perfecting the process.. There is never time to complete a project completely. We are constantly trying to hit a moving target so you never ger a sense of accomplishment.                .
good,"whatever is the hottest/ highest priority for production fo the day gets all the attention from production managers, mfg. engineering manages, IPTs. Everyone is a project manager"
good,If you have the skill set...there are many departments to work. I learned how to multi task and work in multiple programs to complete my daily tasks. Their benefits package was top notch. 401k and health.
good,"Productive workplace with training opportunity.  Attention to Detail required.  Availability for change is required.  Multi Tasking required.  Leadership is required.  Ability to work independently required. "
good,I had personality conflict with the supervisor. At times he seemed irritated if an employee needed help or had a question. I did learn a lot about wiring and cable bundles.
good,Build great products.  Unmanned aircraft division is not as systematically organized as the fighter and bomber divisions. Specialty engineering including safety are not as heavily emphasized or considered as valuable in being cost effective as is the case for othe aerospace companies. Very solid benefits provided. Collegueal work environment.
good,This was a very satisfying place to work.  It was contract work which is very unsettling when the contract came up for renewal.  Waiting to see if you would still have a job.
good,My position at NG is challenging yet rewarding.  This is the place to be if you are looking to expand your skills in negotiating and supplier management.
good,A typical day is worked on a 9/80 work schedule. I have learned about management processes and security protocols. The workplace culture is satisfying. The hardest part of the job is managing your time wisely and the most enjoyable part of the job is the teamwork atmosphere.
good,"Hostile work environment, Management was not willing to listen or support."
good,"very busy day in and out"
good,"Contract position - still there, but may be ending"
good,"There really wasn't a typical day.  If you planned to do things, it almost never happened.  Working on a program away from HQs doesn't allow you the exposure and opportunities you would have if you worked at HQ or a place that has many programs.  The culture was not always the greatest.  I was fortunate to have some great mentors, but that's not always so for everyone. The most enjoyable part were the friendships that I made over the years."
good,"Great people to work with despite a very fast paced environment, learned how to interact with senior executives, training available, tuition reimbursement"
good,Worked in the business analysis  and financial planning department.  Company offered extensive training and opportunities for advancement.  I enjoyed the work and the environment.
good,"typical day began with daily staff meetings, phones to clients, action items, conf. calls"
good,"This company is great for those seeking long term job security.  Provides interesting work.  The work culture is relatively low stress.  However, when needed you will be asked to work weekends with overtime."
good,"Was there as seasonal contractor, no benefits. I've heard the benefits and opportunities were good. Most jobs require a degree, no advancement opportunity without one no matter how long you work there."
good,A typical day at the client site includes working from 9-5. I learned several new applications. The hardest part of the job is future advancement and stability in the workforce.
good,My job consist of 80% travel which made me enjoy the job. The leadership was professional and understood the need of the employee. The job was extremely exciting and fun.It also gave me the opportunity to develop my skill. The job also gave me the opportunity to share my 30 plus years of experience with other logicians within my field of Logistic
good,"I Liked the job, but there was no room for small mistakes, and the bosses stood over our shoulders which made for a too stressful work environment. Would not recommend."
good,Good place to work paid for Masters degree and keep the day to day okay I liked working for them They have many locations to work and are very much entrenched with the defense industry. very big on engineers .
good,Very fast paced and exciting place to work.  The compensation is not the best but the work was rewarding.  The management not very receptive to family needs.
good,First and foremost they seem to compensate fairly. A typical day at work would consist of doing modifications and upgrades to test equipment. I learned enough in a short period to advance in my career elsewhere.
good,actively recruiting and retaining younger workforce to replace those retiring.  very good benefits. liberal tuition assistance. many opportunities for career advancement if you are open to relocate.
good,Was fun to work on cutting edge of technology. Is somewhere I would like to have continued working. Raises were not great but company was having issues with frozen economy. Things may be better now
good,As with any contract Northrop Grumman lost its contract for Department of State locations. Loved working for this company and had good benefits just no job security.
good,"•	Responsible for the overall material support of a repair or spares contract. "
good,"Good company to work for, however latest transitions have created heavier workload, thus creating problems with Job Work/Life Balance."
good,a lot of good people work here but the management lacks the care for the everyday mechanic and their financial well being.
good,Many very skilled resources committed to high quality products and support fort he customers. Some management chains levy requirements and processes without understanding the customer and the aspects of delivering the best possible product.
good,Northrop Grumman believes strongly in the health of their employees.  They advocated healthy work habits and promoted daily exercise.  My only complaint stems from their lack of drive towards newer technologies in web development.
good,"Northrop Grumman is a rewarding place to work.  The culture of the company is engagement and employee satisfaction.  "
good,"Northrop is good company to work for, they have steady work and a culture of keeping their employees happy.  The co-workers you interact with will have some of the largest amount of aircraft and skilled labor experience."
good,"fast pace good co-workers. no training and no advancement. disassemble, test, repair, aseemble USPS mail processing equipment."
good,NOC is a global technology company.  I enjoyed most of the times I spent there.  Budget cuts and a changing defense perspectives have forced the company to re-create itself.  This has caused some massive changes to take place and they continue to this day.
good,"Great organization - Work at customer site makes us a remote location. Dealing with customer management daily as a contractor."
good,It was a lovely place to work. Benefits were good and the shift. Paid for my education. I was promoted within but unfortunately because of budget cuts layoffs happened.
good,"The only way you can get ahead in this company is to come with a offer from another company or leave the company and come back. Management (on my program) are to be desired, multiple PM have been fired, though in this company they where just relocated. Compensation are great, they match 4 or 5% for 401k."
good,I have worked for this company over 16 years at different facilities.  It produces great military products.  I would like to work closer to home.
good,"Overall a great company to work for, great benefits with what we have now overall for most companies in general, great people to work with, and awesome work ethics."
good,"The company has been, like others, using buzzwords about improving employee engagement, and this year they added inclusion. The surveys and changes seemed hollow at first, but there have been some recent signs of improvement. There has been some more hiring and they have been trying to make the new hire experience better, to help retain talent. We'll see how it continues."
good,Most I like about NGC is work env. co-workers interaction and exciting projects. Some managers love to micro management rather some others are easy going people and give you room to grow and ask questions.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job were all the fabulous people I got to interact with daily.  Everyone was so eager to fulfill their mission to support our nation's heroes.
good,"The work place was good, however the Military that we worked with seemed to look down at  the contractors. The company was very supportive of the individuals working at ""the site."" The people are the one's who made the job bearable. The pay could have been better, but this is probably what was budgeted."
good,"I worked for the State Local part of NG, for the most part it was a good work environment. A typical day at work is arrive at your assigned program and attend the briefing meeting then get to work on your assigned action items and task."
good,"Northrop Grumman (satellite division) specializes in producing satellites. I am given a blue print and I program, set-up and operate a CNC to manufacture parts."
good,Solid company and benefit package.  Very slow moving environment but this depends on the organization unit you report to.  Better managed units operate in line with 21st century businesses.  Others are quite amazing at how antiquated processes are.
good,"Nice place until company closed/moved location."
good,"After hiring in with TRW later purchased by NG, the cultural changes have been hard.  I do realize that things needed to change to keep pace with rising costs, etc. but at times some of the changes were presented almost rudely, many after the fact.  Work wise, this company provides many unique opportunities that push the person to new and exciting innovations.  Working in aerospace offers many interesting challenges and you are always learning something new.  It is never boring!"
good,Used to be a good place to work until the contract expired.  Poor corporate advocacy of workers interest.
good,While the work is good and the company pays well you do need to worry about weather the Government contract is going to be renewed each year so you are not sure if you are going to have a job the following year.
good,My immediate supervisor was very supportive.  CDC contract was in a nice facility on the CDC campus.
good,It is a secure job. There is not a lot of room for advancement however there are few layoffs.
good,Good place to work and thoroughly enjoy working for Northrop Grumman.  Great company
good,"A day at work would be arranging meetings, doing expense reports,  ordering items with online purchasing software, I would make travel arrangements."
good,Arizona......right to work....hot hot hot ....losely organized . military base
good,"Benefits and work life balance make this place attractive. But, young talent is not encouraged or promoted. For new graduates coming out of school, political challenges can be difficult to deal with."
good,"Nice people and pay was great.  Not sure now that the market is down and up. However, family owned company treated us well."
good,Good job good pay some good people management could be better just like everywhere they love asskissers
good,"I generally enjoy working for Northrop Grumman. My coworkers are good people who encourage success in their team mates and help out whenever needed. I enjoy the analysis portion of my job the most and constantly looking for process improvements. Implementation can be difficult at time because of the bureaucratic nature of the aerospance defence contrator industry."
good,"Northrop Grumman was great to work for, but their contract ended and the new company took over.... much different from previous employers...."
good,"NG is very competitive company.  I have meet a great group of co-workers they will stop and help when asked. There have been many nights when working late you come across a problem all you have to do is send out a help request and they will jump in to assist, that's what I like most about working for the company."
good,My first IT job and working alongside the USAF was fantastic.  Too bad contracts don't always get renewed and people get laid off.
good,"Good company. Senior management emphasis on values, but little flow down through Director level."
good,"A lot of change going on in the Company now.  Government contract business is being strained by fiscal uncertainty.  However, thoughtful senior leaders are trying to skillfully guide the company through these uncharted waters."
good,Challenging work environment with competitive pay. Frequent organizational change and opportunity for advancement. 
good,"Great place to work; enjoyed using my skills as an administrator to aide customers. Steady flow of customers receiving parts. The work schedule was hectic at times; fast paced, minimal pressures, and allowed different oppurtunities and different flow each day."
good,When they had a Rif  i was told as well as the rest of team just a week earlier that are positions were going to be permanent. They just need to let people know what is going on more
good,"Great team work atmosphere."
good,Great job opportunity. Had its ups and downs as like any job but over all. great atmosphere. n employees.
good,"Although a very good and sound company, I did not see a program for developing staff or team members. No real career path charted out between manager and staff members."
good,"NG emphasizes “Innovation”. If you love to provide ideas, they have avenue for you to fund in various levels. However, they are not doing “pure” research, the ideas must align with customers needs. Benefit is OK, they shaved the pension plan several years ago."
good,"its ok, its a good company with good benefits. They will give you work to do. If you like to travel then you can travel they will let you travel. They will put you in a position that will fit you"
good,"The pay is well, the managment is fair, the hours are very good and in all it's a very good company to work for, I would off this job to others."
good,"I am Lead Material Coordinator for a very fast paced, multi tasking Government Contractor."
good,I enjoyed working for Northrop Grumman for 27 years. It gave me the opportunity to assume numerous disiplines. I worked with some very talented people and had a chance to interface with many different Suppliers. I enjoy working within a team enviroment and always tried to lead by example. I have assumed numerous roles within Northrop Grumman and have learned from all of them.
good,"This is a very steady company with, flexibiltiy in terms of work if you have a family or other impormptu obligations."
good,"I have over eight years of experience in the Logistics field both as a Military Service Member and Department of Defense Civilian contractor. I have mentored, trained and supervised a countless amounts of supply technicians. On various occasions, I have received recognition due to my experience and job accuracy."
good,"No such thing as a typical day. The dynamics of the job change day to day. One thing that i have been learning is how to be a good airframe technician. Working on the E-2D, I have gained valuable experience from servicing aircraft, to changing out puematic components. Management does a good with what they have. It is a challange to manage Grumman workers while traing sailors on the E-2D. o-workers are great. We have worked to gether so long that we can read each other and we all help out one another when one is needing help. Hardest part of the job is when there is an incredable amount of work that needs to be done, and sometimes you have to do it by yourself because everyone else is busy. I enjoy the fact that when I walk in the door, there is something different that will need to be done, nothing ever stays the same."
good,"Great company overall, but local management is ineffective."
good,Arrive to work and recieve a passdown from previous shift
good,"All of my co-workers get along with each very well. When a task or class is to be done, everyone works great together to get what needs to be done, done."
good,Great benefits and flex schedules. Very political and competitive.
good,"company is extremely large, making agility difficult. bureaucracy and politics get in the way sometimes of actual work. Teams are well managed and on track, and work is interesting and fun."
good,.Good hard work
good,"Great place to work,  just like any other job,  had its ups and downs... schedule is a big concern.  Company expects too many units to be completed in little time. More emphasis on quality needed"
good,"In my opinion, it’s hard to base what it’s like working for Northrop based on my experience because they acquired the company I worked for (Orbital ATK) almost 3 years ago now. It doesn’t really feel like I work for Northrop because I’m still at the same facility with the same people and same issues. Working for Northrop has opened some doors to me though because of their different affiliations and and departments."
good,"The postal service is never happy no matter what and constantly changing policies and procedures .  Northrop management is inconsistent, there seems to be no common standard to follow . some managers get away with too much unprofessional behavior."
good,The company itself is progressive at the corporate level and has great pay and benefits.  There could be improvements made to increase that diversity and opportunity for advancement at their individual locations.
good,Good job with little advancement opportunity. Benefits were good and people were great but management was lacking with being transparent and honest with employees.
good,"Stable company, good work, average benefits. I was a Cyber Systems Engineer working on an Enterprise packet network. Had the ability to use Agile applications."
good,"Had significant autonomy."
good,"I have really enjoyed the time I have worked at NG.  The people are the best part, very welcoming and supportive.  The work is very interesting and challenging.  Communication is open and friendly."
good,"Most of time, enjoy working here at NG. The management is not any worse than any other places that I have worked for. Pay is good and working from remote is allowed (big plus for me)."
good,Overall Northrop Grumman is an average company to work for. The benefits are good  and work environment was relatively good. The pay  rate is competitive in comparison to other companies in the industry.
good,This company has a lot of former military employees.  This made my transition into the workforce very easy.  I learn a lot about what I wanted to do after the military and what was not going to be part of my ideal job future.
good,Great company with benefits. High stress though. Leadership is often out of touch but great career. I spent many years there and would recommend the company to anyone........................................
good,"If you are considering coming to work for Northrop I recommend it.  If you are considering the foundry, I recommend you plan to move to another organization.  In the high performing part of the company management is fair and they genuinely care about all employees.  If it wasn't a good place to work, it wouldn't be a successful company.  In the foundry however, politics is all that matters.  Total incompetence gets rewarded because it is executed by someone who knows which wheels to grease and projects struggle to move forward.  That said, if your expertise is in fabrication and TD you can find plenty of opportunities outside of the foundry once you connect to a few people outside.   "
good,"The work was interesting because we got to handle high profile projects, but because they were all government contracts, there was sometimes crippling restrictions on processes and what software/tools we were allowed to use to get the job done. The flip side of that is that everything moved at the pace of government work. Most of the time it was fairly low pressure, but every once in a while there would be a time crunch. Overall, it's a nice place to work, but just get used to lots of restrictions."
good,"Northrop is a good place to work but unless you're self motivated and ask questions the initial training is not that great."
good,"Challenging programs - 6 programs in 5 years.  NG has difficulty retaining programs, customers and staff.  Rewarding company from compensation and retention."
good,"Northrop Grumman Has many opportunities for telework to make work and life well balance. My typical day is busy and requires a lot of working on the computer creating orders and emailing suppliers. "
good,"Northrop Grumman is a good company to work with. I have been with company approximately 2 1/2 years as a Contractor. I am in the process of looking for another position because there is a hiring freeze in the Accounts Payable Department. I do believe Northrop is a wonderful company, but at this term in my life, I need a direct-hire position."
good,"I was hired FT with a good salary and benefits.  My manager was kind but leaned toward the micro-managing type.  She truly did care about her people.  "
good,Had a great experience with some great people.  Would go back in an instant.  The flexible schedule was awesome for work life balance.  And the pay was great.
good,"Great place to work, Has many sites that you can relocate too and many areas that you can advance your career. Best thing about working for NG is easily the 9/80 work schedule. "
good,"As with any position, a higher up can make a job pleasant or not pleasant.  It seems that positions are not always filled with the most qualified candidates."
good,"Northrop Grumman provides a productive work environment with ample opportunity to learn and grow within the company, as well as to develop your skills for future opportunities."
good,"the only bad thing at this job was the climbing of alot of stairs, ladders. This place was a fun place to work. There were always training classes for advancement"
good,"Good place to work, salaries are reasonable, benefits are a bit on high side, training is difficult to come by. The biggest challenge is the lack luster leadership in some organizations, integrity is not their (management) best suit."
good,"A lack of accountability through all levels holds back this location.  The people are great and it is rewarding work, but too many small issues become large ones."
good,"Due to many acquisitions at the time of my employment, there were many different subcultures. Due to the enormous size and subcultures splits, it was difficult to find a comfort zone. Northrop pays well, I was very well compensated as a female professional. They had excellent professional development opportunities, the work was challenging, and management encouraged and supported career advancement. At the time, Northrop was challenged to redeploy people due to the organizational structure, which led to higher turnover than normal."
good,"Northrop Grumman is a top notch corporation that has opportunity to grow if you fit into the mold that is needed. Often for older employees (non-new grads) programs for accelerated growth are not as prevalent; it is up to older employees to figure out paths of career growth on their own. That said, it is a good company to work for and they do offer good benefits and opportunity if you fit the mold of the company and its strategic path. Culture is definitely broad and open and they support many different ways of daily work/life balance needs."
good,"NG is a good company to work for with many locations, opportunities, great benefits, education assistance, and learning opportunities.  Work/Life balance is hard to balance for salaried employees.  The employee is in control of his/her own career path.  Very inclusive and diverse environment."
good,It was a great place to work and the people are friendly and look out for other employees. the only draw back was that in a field engineer position it was hard on the work/home life.
good,"Great staff, local management was lackadaisical and unresponsive. Corporate level support was very good and appreciated.  Benefits were great and pay was very fair."
good,"The production side is dog eat dog where you are just another body and the raises come in points of a percent. Test and Development is 180 degrees from the production world, but if you want to make any money you still need a degree and a career path that puts you far away from the product."
good,Good place to begin a career and to advance a career.  Lots of opportunities to learn  new skills.  Company is willing to assist in continuing education.
good,"The product line is interesting and there are a wide variety of opportunities across the US at this company.  Like any large company it can be bureaucratic.  And I would say the organization is very numbers/results driven, however the company is good about recognizing performance excellence."
good,good working place to work for. If you are into manager this is a place for you to work.  The work is competitive and challaging  for new worker. will be a place to learn.
good,The section i worked at was fast paced and did not leave room for a lot of error. I was over a very good team of mechanics. We where like a family and we took care of each other.
good,"The work day was flexible allowing me to get in early and leave early or come in later and leave late. The work was done in cubicles but comrade between co workers in each division was high and collaboration was common. As an on call employee I would have some weeks with packed 8 hour days and other weeks with nothing to do but study training material and prepare for the next job. I was able to learn programming on the job and work with Unity 3D  as well as develop for Oculas Rift Vive and Microsoft HoloLens. My other duties included 3D modeling, texturing and graphic design work with a weekly meeting to check up on progress and share successes."
good,"Check daily tasks.  Organize prioritize."
good,Great Place to work and grow. Although the weather is rough the experience is second to non other. The management is fair and the compensation matches the cost of living.
good,"Typical day is 8.5 hours (30 minutes off for lunch), on a rotating shift of 0700-1530, 0800-1630, 0900-1730 depending on shift. Wide latitude on personal space and operations, managers expect you know what you are doing and tend to avoid micromanagement; conversely if you do not know what to do you will need to speak to our site or departmental manager, due to the previous assumption."
good,"Good benefits and great job security.  The company does a good job of supporting work-life balance by way of allowing flexible options for managing family events and emergencies.  It can be challenging to move around the company for career growth though, unless you have the good fortune of being selected for a rotation program.  While the executive leadership have great intentions and genuine concern for their employees, lower level management is hit or miss.  Company culture and leadership is inconsistent across departments.  There's a huge gap between those who come into the company and quickly soar up the career ladder, and those who are starved for promotion after years of service.  The company could benefit from a stronger emphasis on cross-training and requiring employees to rotate through related departments or across programs.  If you want a secure, predictable job, it's a good place to be."
good,my job was pretty easy and my job was secure as long as i was performing well. there wasn't much room for improvement and my management changed a few times which slowed my progress. i left because i felt like i had peaked with what i was being given but had no where to go.would have liked more money but in the end i left to pursue more.
good,"Normally a pretty laid back and good working environment. The process (which ensures that the software is of high quality) sometimes feels like it does not accomplish much of anything, but yet can take up a majority of your time. Other than that, I would suggest this company to someone looking for a developer role."
good,"I worked for NGC when they did applications systems for the Department of Human Services. Overall it was my second job and it was a pleasant work environment for the most part, but at other times it felt like I was not as well compensated the way I should have been, unlike the mid management. It was a good place for someone already working in an upper level office position but as far as a general tech person, not as much opportunity, but very good for the experience section on the resume."
good,"NGC did not try to find a position to fit my job skills after my position was terminated. I was employed with TRW/NGC for 15 years. I managed the Support portion ($8 mil plus) of a Fielding Contract and and had a cost under run of $830,000 and that meant nothing to the Upper Management."
good,NG goes above and beyond in making their employees feel welcomed and at home. They have programs to help deal with work/life balancing. They have a team of HR personnel to assist with a smooth transition into your position.
good,"NG had a great employee base and career progression program. The workforce at NG was quite enjoyable, but some of the management progression within certain communities is very loyal to tenured employees. The company was reluctant to welcome new outside management to the organization."
good,"A very rewarding place to work.  Like most big companies, there is a lot of process and bureaucracy at the higher levels.  <y location had the 9/80 work week with flex-time which was very enjoyable."
good,"Photography included everything from portraits  to classified material. "
good,"The company overall was great to work for, but the management wasn't always the best - but that can be said of most employers. However, the benefits and pay were fantastic."
good,"Decent pay, every other Friday off work, not much work life. Older group of people that work here, there's a lot of people retiring soon so that will open doors for younger folks."
good,following morning roll call supervisor or lead mechanic would brief us or assign a vehicle to us with a packet in the packet would be a rsoi and service or deadline maintenance are time was tracked accordingly
good,The work environment was very structured.  The work was organized and attended daily scrum meetings to keep team abreast to the status of the projects and upcoming events.  Created CRs and IPs for SW delivery.  Attended ERB and CCB board meetings to present CRs and IPs.
good,The atmosphere is collaborative and family like. The people are nice and helpful. This would be a good place to retire from. The benefits are pretty good too.
good,A typical workday was very fun and exciting. There is opportunity to learn a lot with the provided learning apps like Lynda.com. The environment is very relaxed.
good,"Working at Northrop Grumman is a relatively cushy job, however advancement comes slowly. Most Level 2 engineers and up, management, and other desirable positions come from the outside."
good,"You won't be working on the big next Tech paradigm, and won't be paid like a typical Techie, but if you are a developer looking for the work-life balance that the Tech industry doesn't provide, NG has you covered. Overtime is usually paid, tightly controlled, and minimal. Work-from-home is popular and trivial to arrange (as long it does not hit your performance)."
good,"Great place to work. The HR Call Center management was hard to work with. The environment in that area was all about ""Who you Know and Not What You Know""."
good,"Flexible work times, 9-80 program, and decent benefits. "
good,"Overall, work with good people. The department is still in the developing stage so there are no areas for growth unless you are on the manager's favorite team."
good,Hard to work in IT. IT is divided into a lot of small groups with similar responsibility. there is a lot of internal competition for the projects. People and teams compete for charge number.
good,Every department is required to work together to accomplish a goal. The goal is to build a vessel for the defense of the country. There are many positions that are within anyones grasp.
good,"The best part of the job was working with great people, whenever I needed help on the job there was always someone who I could contact. However the work environment needs some work. Luckily when I left they were working on just this."
good,Fulfilled the departmental requirement for a technical illustrator while in the position of technical writer/editor.  Gained experience and insight into what was required of technical illustrators.
good,"My direct supervisor worked with us on our projects doing the same thing we were doing.  While he was responsible for administrative work, he would also work as a technical writer."
good,"Work-life balance does not exist at this company. On the bright side, the pay is good and you are compensated for overtime. Health benefits are above average but feel lacking with the size and reputation of the company. HR is great here as well."
good,"Many opportunities to excel in various locations world-wide. A great blend of technical, logistical, operational professionals who believe in the work that they do each day to support our customers' needs."
good,It is an okay place to work.  Onboarding can be challenge but if you get a good mentor you can navigate the challenges easier.  Can be a good career if you keep up skills and stay away from the politics.
good,"Enjoyed working there. The pay was fair. Not a bad place to work. The help desk was great. Very busy, but great to work for. Enjoyed having the weekends off."
good,"Team  Worker with co-worker"
good,"I had the opportunity to work in management for Northrop.  Over the course of my tenure I learned so many interesting things about the company and my functional unit."
good,A typical day at work was removing as many road blocks as possible. The key skill I learned was staying ahead in a plan as much as possible. The hardest part of the job was dealing with 50 people at once. A successful day was moving a critical path job forward and helping a mechanic advance because of his performance.
good,I love working here but the career advancement and pay increases are slow and seem to  have nothing to do with performance. The people are very good and it's a great environment to start a career.
good,"Great Corporation. Lower Management could be supressive. "
good,I enjoyed working at Newport News. I learned a great deal as this was my first job out of tech school. I worked with a lot of good people there. They were wonderful mentors. It was just too expensive of an area to live it at my salary level. I left and got a job working in the area I grew up in making more money and had to spend less for housing.
good,Good work environment. Very fast paced and deadlines are very stringent and adhered to. I would recommend this company to any that thrives on a fast and ever changing environment.
good,"typical work day, depending on the program, is routine, corporate America. I learned quiet a bit about project management, logistics, procurement, and proposals."
good,"Being a technician is rewarding including working indoors and outdoors, troubleshooting circuit boards and telecommunications along with maintaining mainframes"
good,"I liked it. The culture was great. Kicked back. Your on your own to complete the work, not overworked. Hardest part of the job was the hours 9 hour days and early mornings."
good,"I enjoyed the technology, which was space oriented. Very cool, and the tours are wonderful."
good,"This was the most difficult project I had worked to date.  However due to the excellent support structure from the PMO office I felt I always had the ability to do my job."
good,"At Northrop Grumman, there is a growing sense that diversity and inclusion is elemental to a high performance culture. There are ample opportunities to connect with coworkers in an environment that’s uniquely caring, diverse, respectful, and ethical. We collaborate through integrated product teams, cross-functional teams, and employee resource groups."
good,"A challenging job providing support to 4 locations with custom code."
good,"Northrop was a great place to work. I was only there briefly, but they were well-regarded and helped me launch a new part of my career. I would definitely consider going back."
good,"I worked within the antenna group at NG MD. I worked as an RF engineer developing components for a large steerable antenna. The job was fun and rewarding. In order to keep the projects running well and keep the people happy, integrated teams were developed and co-located, which made you think you were working for a small company. I later moved into the IPT lead position but left the company because of family issues. I would still be there otherwise."
good,"In recent years NGC has lowered the quality of its treatment of employees.   Challenging & interesting work, good pay and benefits. company is still growing"
good,"I love working with this company! Their hours are flexible and they are sure to give you all the tools necessary to complete your job accurately. Work load varies. Management processes are a bit slow but all- in- all, they are a wonderful company to work for."
good,"The people here are great and are willing to teach younger engineers.  The work life balance is excellent but the compensation may be a little lower than you could find elsewhere.  The issue I have with the  Rancho Carmel location is that there are many projects being developed and worked on at any given time, but it is very difficult to get to work on them.  Once you are working on one program the program manager will never give up any of you time in fear they won't get your time in the future if needed.  This leads to weeks of downtime when your duties are complete but you aren't allowed to work on other programs."
good,This company provided a way for me to move around and stay protected as an contractor.  While working there I was able to expand my knowledge of various IT components and build upon what I already knew.
good,"Good pay, good management, good place to work. Opportunity for growth. Benefits are good, opportunities for travel. Uniforms provided. Balanced work, family, life."
good,"Northrop was great while it lasted, however with contracting work comes instability! The benefits and compensation were excellent, however the lack of warning before termination may be problematic!"
good,"This is a huge and well diversified Aircraft/Avionics company that employs a vast majority of professionals.  It serves the population by providing jobs at all levels and hence, helps family to meet with their financial and domestic obligations."
good,Team environment with a lot of collaboration across teams to finish projects on time and within budgets. I was also able to conduct and participate in several cross team meeting and chaired the CCB meetings representing manufacturing for all 20 of our sites across the country.
good,Promised 6-month contract. Management do not seem to be able to formulate a plan beyond 1 week. As soon as you get up to speed they seem to cut their losses with very little foresight.
good,"For the short time that I worked there, my manager was the best that I have had in over 30 years of working. There was a great group of people in the calibration lab."
good,"Good place to work had some really good co-workers that i worked with. I learned alot things while working here that i'll take with me , management wasnt the best but for the most part they were very helping in getting employees anything we needed to improve performance and put out out a quality product.The workplace culture was always safety first and to put out the best and top quality product, the hardest part of the job was the many procedures changes that would occur week to week that would make it difficult to complete your work assignments and the most enjoyable part were the people i worked with and knowing we put out a good product."
good,"NGC is an excellent employer, however they are not supportive of remote employees, and do not encourage their career growth and development. The industry is also very volatile, and reorganization happens frequently."
good,Management only listens to management.  There are benefits in working for a large company.  There is an atmosphere that it's easier to get ahead because of who you know and not what you know.
good,Great opportunities to do High tech software development for the National security community. I recommend to anyone wanting a solid career
good,Very challenging work environment in a positive way you get out what you put in !!!!!! .Great opportunities for both hourly personnel and management .  The company  provides  great educational opportunities
good,"Northrop is a very large defense contractor.  That means the hours are flexible but consistent, good pay, good benefits, you never need to bring your work home with you (and often can't), and your job can never be outsourced."
good,"Standard day when not in training mode is to check email, prioritize responses and check what tasks are required. Learning opportunities are available in house to expand knowledge."
good,Work hours flexibility and work/family balance is great and compensation is competitive. Overall benefits are very good. The general staff is very professional and great to work and interface with.
good,Started in 1985 for Northrop. Fine small company that ran efficiently and good work environment. Rated #4 in good places to work. Brought in mass amounts of personnel from companies that weren't good places to work for the B-2 program. Work environment was never the same. Left in 1999 but returned in 2007 to maximize my retirement benefits. Retired after 20 years with the company.
good,"My typical day was as follows: meet with lead, determine what the priorities of the day were and generally get to working starting with the highest priority items. "
good,"Surrounded with good people with various kills.  Good benefits for decent price.  There's a lot of rules and red tapes, but it's expected from a company this size.  The work place is as fun as you make it."
good,Northrop Grumman is an enjoyable company to work for. like any large company you do have your challenges with co-workers and management but all in all Northrop Grumman is a decent company to work for. The hardest part of the job is to become stagnate.
good,"Very rewarding company to work for.  Truly felt honored to be working with and for the US Military.  Extremely talanted work force, engineers, management, functional work area managers."
good,"Interesting work and nice work-life balance, but in some areas a bit behind non-defense industry.  Too much strategizing from the past;  need more young leadership IMHO."
good,"NG is a vibrant, intellectually stimulating atmosphere where creating technical wonders to support national security is a routine way of life."
good,Process is driven by the ability to review work at any level.  Expect to fill out a few more forms for a task.  Projects are complex and so tasks stay in limit range for expertise rather than trying to learn everything about each ship.
good,"Job Duties: working with your hands, drilling, shooting, bucking on New aircraft build E-2  on cockpit, middle barrel, lower forward and cabin roof."
good,"Good company.  Management needs help.  I loved my job they just could not keep us busy.  Lots of layoff in 2014."
good,"10 hour work day, 4 day work week, solid upper management, not much opportunity to work overtime.  Goverment contracts."
good,Good place to work. Good Benefits. Started to give remote access to most workers. Corporate killed this location in the name of better profits
good,"Great company, but roles are limited to contrating.  Great 401k only if you invest in it.  They always seem to be looking but they don't respond to your submissions."
good,"Great career start opportunities and training but trending down."
good,Co-workers are great! Everyone is very friendly and helpful. Management needs help in communication with employees. The job provides a challenge about 50% of the time. Overall good company to work for. The most enjoyable part of the job is interaction with co-workers
good,"Good place for engineers and technical positions, but all others depend on your position and management structure. Management style is a heavy top-down approach without regard to how it affects the people below."
good,"Many different systems to work, which makes it fun and challenging. Work with a great bunch of guys and gals... Learned a lot about the importance of proper documentation in a manufacturing environment, specially for a DoD company. Management is very accessible and supportive."
good,"A fast paced, complex commodity end product, environment. Excellent knowledge of electronic systems and sub-components was required. A pleasure to work together with such a diverse, intelligent group of co-workers."
good,fast passed working enviroment with good people and good fun .
good,"Group Manger with two section managers working in my Group supporting 7-14 employees.  Typical day consist of ensuring my employees have the tools and support they need to get the job done."
good,"same as previous statement. I still work for this company. co-workers are great, I learn everyday about government contracts and projects."
good,"The job is interesting, working with data of CMS.  Learned a lot of new skills.  The people that I worked and interacted were fabulous.  The manager was great and very understanding.  hardest part of work was to meet dead-lines when the equipment is down for a long period.  Most enjoyable is that we had a terrific team"
good,"Enjoyed my time working with some great people in SLC.  Defense industry is challenging and rewarding, but not always stable do to funding issues."
good,"Typical Day at Work: Data mining, analysis, fact gathering, research, heavy advanced MS Excel, technical writing, presentations to upper management/customers."
good,"Support packaging for shipment issues for navigation systems electronic assemblies.  Deal with customer concerns over possible hardware damage due to transportation loads environment.  Develop custom packaging for any unique system requirements to ensure reduction of shock loads transmitted to hardware.  Northrop Grumman is a great company with many very talented employees.  The hardest  part of the job was also the most enjoyable part of the job.  Dealing with the challenge of supporting packaging design issues for harware designed and produced at two facilites 500 miles apart, and ensuring all issue concerns are sucessfully dealt with, and the appropriate information is diseminated to those requiring it."
good,"Very schedule and very high attention to metrics and time, down to seconds."
good,"The Chores were good. Many of the employees that I helped were my friends."
good,"As is the norm in management, there is more to do than we can accomplish in a given day. Managing my schedule is a balancing act between a structured weekly schedule and prioritizing the areas of responsibility that benefit by a specific focus."
good,Worked with Northrop Grumman for 33 years and am not to familiar with other companies and their benefits.  Will be retiring soon running out of gas.
good,"I worked at many different locations and settings for this company, over the course of 33+ years so it is not feasible to describe a typical day, or manager. I have worked with many wonderful people, both my junior and senior. It was rewarding dealing with my counterparts in the Armed Services."
good,Have enjoyed working for NG during length of contract. Supervisor/Manager have been excellent to work for. Sorry to see contract coming to end from customer.
good,NGC is a challenging work environment but I have a desire to do more and learn more especially in the system engineering and project management field.
good,"answering support tickets"
good,Management closed a great facility well before its time.  The shipyard produced legendary products before WWII and should have continued beyond Enduring Freedom.
good,"Good People"
good,I loved this company and would not be leaving if i could find a location closer to home
good,"My work day is 6:00 am to 2:30 pm.  I would take care of general maintenance of the lighting and any problems with equipment that may arise during a work day.  There are times I help other maintenance workers with projects working side by side as a team to complete the assignment.  "
good,"Work usually comprised of collaborating with various work groups to collect the needed data to determine and forecast the amount of spare parts needed to maintain operation of the customer's aircraft.  I learned a lot about supply chain and logistics management, in regards to how the availability of spares is affected by various factors such as procurement lead time, reliability, etc."
good,"Excellent company with good benefits. Interesting work relating to NASA missions. Due to the shrinking opportunities in NASA programs, this facility has very little work. Long term stability and security in question."
good,"Excellent company for various tradesmen/skills in shipbuilding.  Long hours, attention to detail and safety are paramount.  Learned to work as a team and have confidence and trust in co-workers and supervisors.  Enjoyed the autonomy of self-paced work days and challenges everyday."
good,"NGC is a highly competitive and rewarding place to work. The number of projects that NGC supports is large. The staff member who need to do something different from what they have been doing for years is able to bid out when they feel that its time to do so."
good,"The company has a history that is maintained of only hiring the best. While not the highest paying, they have a very large support and benefits package that offsets simple pay."
good,"I am able to use my creativity to help solve complex problems as they relate to business and company values.  I am successful at being a leader, when needed and work closely with others to ensure quick response to immediate issues.  I position myself to know every aspect of the projects goals and impart my knowledge where needed."
good,"Always lots of work to do, great people to do it with. Hard to move up corporate ladder. Not alot of opportunities. Pay increases are not competitive. Very strong corporate culture with emphasis on employee engagment. Not a great work life balance however."
good,its a good place to work if you want to make a career management is kind poor no dental benefits its hot in thre summer cold in the winter
good,"First I would like to point out that I miss my coworkers, it was a good environment to work in.  I also had the opportunity to meet people from all over the world since I worked side by side with the Air Force.  There was not a lot of room for advancement and it seemed that you had to know the right people to move up."
good,"Was a good place to work. "
good,"After realizing my discharge from the Air Force was imminent; I looked into NG. They were the ONLY contract company who recognized the skills I received while in the military. Promising company with excellent benefits. Excellent pay, and vacation time. Only down side was the location. I am/was in an overseas location, Ali Al Salem, AB in Kuwait. Being so far from family and friends is taxing and stressful. "
good,"My daily work was assembling and wiring Test Sets (ATE-ATS for US Post Office) to drawling and wire list from engineers until all seven test sets was finished, tested, and testing circuit boards For boards that stopped working and/or updating the firmware on the boards. Then kept a database of information on each board, after problems were fixed board was shipped back to post office location it came from.   "
good,"Everyday, I always learned something knew and I had excellent teachers guiding and instructing me. Working on a carrier gave me the opportunity to learn vast amounts of equipment in a very short 18 months. After a few months of familiarization, we would have our tool bag, list of equipment to fix, and we would be on our own fixing everything we could in one day. I spent my days troubleshooting and repairing alarm and warning systems and my nights exercising, ironing my uniform, and reading."
good,"I enjoyed this job, and the people are awesome. In a given work day I was asked to do any number of things from filing, to spreadsheet management, to quality inspection. I learned how to work with people, organization, and good time management. My only problem was the way it ended. I was called in by the manager and laid off with a one day notice. After two years of working, I thought I deserved better."
good,"Analysis of network traffic and incoming web site requests. Review of multiple intel reports regarding threat actors activities. Send appropriate reporting to network defenders, and offensive cyber planners."
good,"Great place to work, job security isn't the greatest currently but that is in the entire industry. Many opportunities to cross train with higher positions."
good,"Good salary, OK management, No work life balance, No advancement."
good,Typical day at work would be coordinating documentation development.
good,I value my time spent at Northrop Grumman. I contributed a lot in the Engineering department as well as value the learning experience. I was fortunate to have an employer that let me excel!
good,"Workday was like any other CDC employee, only I work for Northrop Grumman and they pay my paycheck"
good,Only concern is job security. There have been so many organizational changes and strategic realignments the line is somewhat insecure about their future.
good,Great job but subject to contractual changes and deep security reviews.
good,"If you think outside of the box and unafraid of risks, you can do well here."
good,Left company for an advancement - wouldn't have left except for the new job opportunity
good,Great company to work for. Under a teammate environment everyone is treated equal and provided opportunities to grow.
good,"I can honestly say that I was instrumental to bring Northrop Grumman up to the 21st Century by creating web based programs that were user friendly and provided accountability. I enforced policies that had never been followed and I was the glue that held the Law Department together. I was the liaison for the Law Dept. and worked closely with the other functional dept heads. I managed a $52M budget; learned an extradionary amount of management information; refined my people skills and brough the department together (which consisted of 6 different business [Sectors]) across the United States and 3 European offices. I led the department, yet developed a team environment so that there was consistency amongst all emoloyees and a much higher level of moral."
good,"I regret ever leaving Northrop. I left for money. The compensation was that great, the training/development and support was great."
good,"Great people easily get scooped up by other companies and move on in lieu of being leveraged to other programs. A waste of proven talent. Great ethics program, very high standards made me proud to work there. Seasoned co-workers act like a team."
good,"Good job with a great team, but limited input/oversight from corporate, which is both good and bad."
good,"First manufacturing environment, enjoyed the experience very much. Extremely detail oriented due to governmental audits frequently. One of only ten others out of 1,000 employees to operate the warehouse forklift. Entertained the offer of a continued education in pursuit of my Bachelors of Business Management with an emphasis in Operations. Unfortunately, the lack of defense funding has the company slowly diminishing with no new awarded contracts and little funding for returns or reworks."
good,"I enjoyed going to work, a great group of people to work with day to day. My managers were fair and supportive. It wasn't always easy to get training unless you did well with online training."
good,"I don't mind the company. NGC won a contract takeover. However, they cut staff and wages to win that contract war. With that being said, the job and clients remain the same, which is why I started in this business 2 years ago. Hardest part of my job is personality conflicts. Management is management, a plus to them is they do not micro manage. Best part of the job is I have the opportunity to travel often. i would recommend working for this company."
good,"No two days are alike. I am constantly involved in coordinating our efforts with everyone from all conceivable functions to support the load schedules of 4 separate production lines in two different facilities that provide F/A-18, and T-38 retrofit and spare components to fleet readiness centers across the country."
good,Working for Northrop Grumman IT department was exciting each day the work flow went very well.
good,"See above. We were always waiting for the next contact, which I understand is not uncommon in the airspace and defense sector. I enjoyed the people very much."
good,Everyday is an adventure when working with foreigners.  Being able to adjust to different cultures is very beneficial which makes for an unforgettable life experience.
good,"For a typical day at NGC I am comfortable. The company has ride share program to help employees to arrive work and return home safe and faster. Great employees benefit program."
good,"The reason I’m looking for a new position is because I feel like I’m stuck where I am at and not being used to my full capabilities. Company is great, just time for a change"
good,"If you are looking for leading edge aerospace work, this is the place.  Air craft, spacecraft, Electronics, design, all under the same roof.  Good people and a great experience ."
good,Introduces you to software engineering work environment in a systematic structured way while providing opportunities to demonstrate capability. Northrop often promotes from within and you can build a career there.
good,"Challenging environment, nice teams, good management at times. Culture was easygoing most of the time. Only left because I needed to move from Phoenix for family reasons"
good,"If you have a home room manager that actually cares about their team, then you will have a great experience.  But when the Homeroom manager is all about themselves and you happen to get in the way of their spotlight, then they make it difficult for you until you decide to leave."
good,"Great Benefits and a good company,  although the location I was at wasn't completely updated, needed more room for people to work and management changed alot. 3.5 out of 5."
good,"Worked there for 10 plus years, My only complaint was the massive layoffs they would conduct on senior employees. With years of service. Wish they would treat employees like family and not cogs in a wheel."
good,"I worked on the IBCS Program at NGC and it was a fast almost 6 years for me. Never a dull moment and always something going on. Hard to advance within the company is my only complaint and that drove me else where."
good,Coming out of college I loved working for northrop grumman. They have a very competitive starting salary and a great global name with interesting projects. They also attract a lot of young talent from which I learned from and collaborated well with. Their work-life balance is great with a flex schedule being a big encouragement.
good,"Good place to work, great opportunities both internal and client facing. Hierarchical environment, largely due to being a government contractor. Would recommend as a place to work."
good,"Northrop is a very structured environment, it's a good place to work. I really enjoyed working a 9/80 schedule. Very supportive of continuing education. Had comparable compensation and benefit plan."
good,"Overall, a good working environment. disappointed in the lack of support upon losing the contract to find employment within the company for loyal 10+ year employees."
good,Northrup grumman really helped with my education and Ed-assist is a huge reason I was able to move up in positions due to the knowledge gained in classes.
good,Great place to work if you have a supportive manager and goals set for advancement. There is large corporation bureaucracy to deal with but with proper mentorship and support you can advance quickly.
good,Great Place to work and I enjoyed my teammates. I worked for this company as a contractor for a the federal government. They treated their employees well but the CEO etc were very disconnected from the employees
good,"At NGC I am tasked with many different hats to fulfill. It is hard to explain a typical work day because each day is not typical. The hardest part of the job is having to complete all the Corporate flow downs that are very time consuming and never really amount to anything other than meetings, engagements, and reviews."
good,Working for Northrop Grumman was very rewarding.  I was able to learn multiple new disciplines and was able to grow my technical prowess under the guidance of multiple mentors.
good,Plenty of opportunities if you are an engineer.  Employ veterans and a multicultural working environment.  Employee surveys were offered yearly and management was interested in employee engagement.
good,There is little work life balance with this job. The work can be stressful and demanding. The employees are great people to work with while under duress.
good,Northrop Grumman is more than a defense contractor and has grown IT services and technologies agressively since the early 2000's. In my experience Northrop did suffer from have non-technical managers leading engineers and developers especially in the IT segments of the company.  Northrop Grumman's Cyber services are also constantly changing which can be confusing to it's employees and perspective clients.
good,"Your experience will depend a lot on your location and program."
good,"Since it is an older company, things move slow. However, this allows for a normal work schedule that provides work/life balance. As the older workforce prepares for retirement, there is lots of opportunities for Millennials to advance their career. The culture may be challenging for most Millennials, as the company's leadership style is still command-and-control, promote by seniority, and very hierarchical. You do need to manage your own career and drive your manager to help find future opportunities across the company. The benefits are good, but they recently got rid of their pension plan a few years ago. Overall, if you are looking for a place to hang your hat for the rest of your career, or for several years, and want to enjoy work/life balance, this is the place for you."
good,Great place for exposure to and gaining experience across broad range of disciplines. Demands high performance. Much emphasis placed on application of proper ethical behavior.
good,Not the most fun or exciting place to work but it is solid work and has pretty good pay.  A lot of the buildings are very old and cell phones with cameras aren't allowed.
good,There are many opportunities to learn and to grow. Work schedule is flexible and there seems to be a lot of trust between management and employees. There are many sub-cultures within the company so you need to be adaptive.
good,"Great Place to work, amazing atmosphere and work place. They are very big on career advancement. Management encourges us to ask questions and to think of new ways of doing things. My only complaint is the medical benefits are not good or someone who has health issues like diabetes."
good,"During my tenure at Northrop Grumman, I had the opportunity to be working as an artist in an engineering driven workflow.  I gained innumerable insights and experiences that expanded my understanding of the potential applications for this type of technology within the industry.  I also had the chance to be involved in many different aspects of 3D development including modeling, animation, texturing, lighting, rigging and rendering."
good,Northrop Grumman is a great place to work with many great and innovative employees.  My goal with my plant/area is to move it from an R&D mentality into a manufacturing mind set as we now make production parts.
good,I've been with NGC for approximately 18 years.   I very much like the company and feel at home here.  Not too many opportunities for mid-career professionals.  Big push to hire and retain millennials.   Once you reach top of salary in your position  don't expect any raises or promotions.  Besides that overall great company to work for.
good,"work with engineers to accomplish tasks to finish a project."
good,"Working for NGC was both a pleasure and exercise in frustration.  First line management was exceptional and understanding.  Supporting the employees in both their work and home life."
good,Constantly busy work pace.  Shift changes are to be expected the first year with the possibility of a regular shift schedule after that. Would have stayed with them however they lost the contract and were unable to place anyone on a new contract.
good,"could spent more time talking with employees for ideals, and promote from within. Spend more time on cross training would help grow the company. But as a whole not a bad place to work."
good,Jobs are paid much less than others in this industry. Not that good of raises and there is a lot of nepotism. The company was good to work for in many ways like benefits and paid time off.
good,Northrop Grumman provided an environment conducive to learning and growing within my field.  They were thorough in their employee evaluations and mentoring.
good,Northrop is a good place to work within the GIS career field when they choose to actively go after contracts. The lack of stable work in the field has driven them to fall off of several contracts.
good,"Northrop is a great company with great people, salaries, and benefits. If you are looking for a place where your skills are recognized, this could be it."
good,"Huge influx of new hires has resulted in many employees being kept in limbo until clearance comes through."
good,"Working at Northrop Grumman is great.  Co-workers are easy to work with and we learn from each other. "
good,"Great company to work, supporting our troops was a wonderful experience, unlimited opportunity to prove your aviation skills, each day was a new assignment."
good,9/80 schedule and the opportunity to work remotely make it easy to have a work/life balance.  This company also allows dedicated employees to move around the company to gain experience and knowledge.
good,Good Company to work for. Education benefits are vital to employee growth.  STEM degree is a benefit to have.  Advancement opportunities are present at all levels.
good,"The hardest part was getting to work being it was 45 minutes away.  Pay was good, job not difficult just demanding. NG is good about promoting within, which makes it nice."
good,"Corporate contractor, working in a government position with union workers. Tough. work flow interrupted by union breaks, union attitude. but the pride in the work being completed was very good."
good,"NGC is a good company. If motivated and driven they offer a lot of good opportunities! Benefits are outstanding such as a 401K with matching, dental and medical."
good,"I enter new data into our database daily.  I then, research the parts until the records are closed. I have learned about our Air Vehicles and Shelters and their parts and what our company stands for.  Most management is good as is our workplace culture.  The hardest part of my job is to work for some that is a micro-manager and gives off negativity all the time.  I like the flexibility of my work hours, casual attire and non-stressful with getting my work done"
good,"Working for Northrop and Grumman I loved working with the people there. They help each other and collaborate to complete the job. The hardest part of the job is the long shifts, however you get more days off per week than a standard job would have."
good,"If you do your work, you'll have no problems. Understanding, sympathetic, helpful company culture. Only potential issue is a lack of opportunities for raises and advancement."
good,"As I have previously stated, Northrop Grumman is a great company to work for. I have had the ability to enhance my analytical skills that will help me in professional career. Hardest part of the job is the never ending monthly cycle and the best part of the job is getting to work with the team i am on. I have had the pleasure of working with incredible people."
good,I have enjoyed my time with Northrop Grumman but am ready to take the next step in my professional career. I have had the ability to learn and develop my analytical skills as well as be exposed to multiple roles and responsibilities. Hardest part of the job is the never ending monthly cycles however the best part of the job is working with the team. I have been fortunate to be on an incredible team with incredible people.
good,"Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.

It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged."
good,"Great place to work, although management gets a little crazy but that's every where you go.  They train you on a lot of different jobs that will help you later down the road in aviation."
good,"The company is large and competitive. They are realigning their positions to require at minimum bachelors degrees in a STEM field. Due to that and lack of work in my field I was allowed to remain for three months with the company, working another position to pick up some job skills and look for other work. The company does not offer vacation, but PTO (Paid Time Off) with a max of 240 hours, this is your sick and vacation combined. The benefits are fairly good, they use Anthem, Blue Cross/Blue Shield for health coverage, Delta Dental, and Vision Plus."
good,"Great benefits, excellent pay, excellent bosses that will work with you on a home life balance. This also depends on work load schedules. "
good,Work was challenging and allowed me to stay current with technology.  Fast paced environment that kept you on your toes. Worked well with peers and management to get the daily tasks completed.
good,"The storeroom goes through a lot of Supervisor/Managers frequently. You are expected to do more with less. Favoritism is in abundance. They say your opinion counts, not necessarily the truth!"
good,"There are many changes taking place as the company positions itself for the future. There are countless opportunities which are becoming available in the Aerospace sector for engineers, technicians and other support personnel.  The company does have a large veteran population amongst its workers."
good,"I learn how to weld in many different setting. It was a task that i took on with grace. The hardest part was making sure that i did burned myself, staying warm in the winter, try to stay put out of the sun in the summer which was very hard. And try to keep the guys away, lol that was fun"
good,Lot's of responsibilities and meetings. Powerpoint culture. Contract business development heavy focus. 
good,"I work a typical day usually as described in the summary:. arrive business casual, check mail, get coffee, begin working, lunch, leave for the day.  The office does not come with me."
good,Working with Northrop was a great opportunity to meet new people and see a lot of new places. I got to travel quite a bit and see many countries. Overall it was a good place to work.
good,"Aerospace Contractor totally beholden to U.S. Defense whims, plus shifts in corporate structure, budget, staff and culture make every quarter an adventure."
good,"That isn’t the end of the MHS’ ammunition woes. While the pistol apparently has no issue cycling the Army’s new XM1153 “special purpose” cartridge, a hollow point round, it apparently does not function reliably when loaded with the standard XM1152 “ball” rounds used most often in service. In order to qualify as a military service weapon, the pistol must be able to fire 2,000 rounds without stoppages at least 95% of the time – a standard both the M17 and M18 pistols were able to meet with hollow points, but with standard ammo, that reliability rate dropped to a dismal 75% in the full size platform, and an even worse 60% on the compact one."
good,Shows respect for all employees by all levels of management and the work environment is very friendly. Very strong leadership. I worked in 3 different Sectors within Northrop and most proud of the work done in Aerospace.
good,"I came to NGC because they promised career advancement and opportunities, but I have not noticed anything. No one here gets promoted, even after over achieving, graduating with your degree and more."
good,Northrop Grumman is a great company to work for... Overall the company has great benefits and enforces a healthy work life balance. Collaboration amongst departments is sometime difficult.
good,A lot of potential for growth and cultivating career. Experience can be stressful depending on management. Encouragement for moving laterally within company.
good,"Northrop Grumman is an stimulating place to work, especially given the number of state of the art and exciting programs to work on. However, it is a large company, and occasionally there can be a lot of bureaucracy to work through."
good,"NG management and personnel were very professional, as were US Gov't personnel; Projects were interesting an worthwhile. Actively managing the project contracts that make the US Missile Defense capability a reality is quite rewarding!"
good,"I enjoyed most of my employment with Northrup Grumman.  The hours were great, the people were fun, and the opportunities were plentiful.  The organizational structure, the performance documentation, and the training was just the best.  Management was a little lacking and was unfortunately placed in a position between two competing managers; management failed to rectify the situation after being informed that it existed.  I later moved on to another department which I enjoyed until I became bored without challenges.  Overall, I would go back to work for Northrup Grumman if the opportunity presented itself."
good,"Many talented people work here. Management has a few challenges, but they are addressing them. Like most companies in this industry, they struggle to invest appropriately to grow the business."
good,Enjoyed working for NG. Was given the opportunity to step up and create my own path for success. Had great mentors and leaders who always made themselves available for guidance and advice.
good,"Highly intelligent and competent colleagues kept the work interesting and engaging."
good,The overall workplace is very supporting and there are always areas to advance.  The atmosphere is a good place for young technical workers to grow and learn on today's growing challenges in the defense industry.
good,"Northrop Grumman is a great place to work with some great benefits, but they have gone through some recent changes which I do not personally agree with.  For example, over a year ago they stopped hiring people who did not possess a Bachelor's Degree, not will they allow those already employed w/o a BS Degree to transfer within the organization, thus causing those people to effectively hit their glass ceiling."
good,innovation is key at Northrop and therefore very fast pace. I think the managers need some core management training or they need to seek more caring people to be managers. The work culture is average I would say and it is very possible to move around to other locations or job duties.
good,"I appreciated the management at NGC and did feel relatively supported. Some of the work was intense and because they are a government contractor, job stability could be fearful at times."
good,The harder you work here the more opportunity for growth and advancement. The benefits and compensation are competitive. Work load can be challenging but provides room for growth and new challenges.
good,Great company for a long career. Very good and smart talented people to work with.  Training and development could be improved. There is no pention but they do have a  401K plan with a match.
good,"Highly integrated team made the work environment an enjoyable place to work while working on a variety of simulation projects.  After a period of high growth, our work share declined and we won few new projects to keep the team employed and we appeared to stagnate."
good,Northrop Grumman provided some training for me when new technology was provided. The work was very challenging and the Electrical Engineering Department was very helpful.
good,"Good benefits, decent pay, good job security and interesting work. Overall a decent defense industry job, up to defense industry standards (but not above and beyond)."
good,"Northrop Grumman is generally a good place to work.  Expectations are fair, sub-par performers are difficult to cut loose, performance appraisals are only loosely based on actual performance."
good,"I've been with TRW/Northrop Grumman Corporation for 20 years, and just love the whole culture of the company and the things they are doing overall. Unfortunately there was a change with our Corporate VP and President of our Sector and he's made changes to our organization throughout. The VP of Program Management which I support was brought down to a Director level and the VP of our sector group took an immediate retirement. So now I'm in the market for a new position and ready to share my experience and talent with other employers in our south bay area."
good,"Kept quite busy as an executive assistant supporting large departments working on awesome unmanned air vehicles."
good,"I love NGC, great company to work for. The workplace culture allows telework, which I like because I need that flexibility. The most enjoyable part of the job was when I participated in the Employee Engagement events where I am on the committee."
good,"Of all the Aerospace and Defense companies I've experienced, Northrop Grumman hands down has the best culture.  "
good,"NG will always underpay you unless you become a manager (people or product). You can work as hard as you want, and it doesn't matter. If you are looking for a place to coast, this is your company. "
good,this company teaches new hires a skill and trade within the scope of the job functions to promote desired results in extreme work environments. the work is hard and dangerous but can be a valuable skill.
good,My time here was relaxed but productive. A great place to network and gained new career opportunities. I learned life skills on how to move forward in my own career.
good,"My very first corporate America job so it was indeed an experience and a challenge.  Wish I had been exposed to what corporate America was like and I may have been better prepared but that was my lack of knowledge . Nevertheless, Northrop remains the best corporate job to date that I have had the opportunity to experience and for this I am forever grateful."
good,Good place to work for. The pay was low but if you work in the corporate sector most jobs let you work from home and there is stability. The pay is lower than industry.  They promote from within
good,"Northrop looks good on a resume and there are many upward opportunities if the employee is willing to relocate.  The company is a strong, major competitor in the defense industry and so there is some stability.  The pay is lower than you find at other defense contractors though."
good,"You can have a good program or a terrible program. You apply for the position you want and hope there is funding, opportunities to learn and develop, and that your management knows what it's doing while supporting you."
good,"I was blessed to have good knowledgeable managers in Service Management.  They had a good 401k with matching and a good vacation earning policy, along with three free days of your choice."
good,It can be educational if you are open minded. Some may say you can get stuck in a job if you are relied on by your manager. Opportunities are thing only you can create.
good,"A typical day at work gets you engaged with customers, "
good,"Love NG and sad that the contract is ending and required to find other work. "
good,"productive and fun workplace, friendly staff and co workers,well  trained management staff, trainers are good, well equipped company.hours of operations is excellent, flexible schedules."
good,"Great job security. Great place to learn multiple disciplines. The culture is intense. They are starting to transition to a better culture, but that does take time and I am unsure how long it will take."
good,"Pros "
good,"NGC is a good company to work for but the environment for business is very competitive and the US government can be a very poor customer in regards to how it views it's contract work force. The customer has little, if any, regard for the effect that their actions have on those that support them (Friday pm tasks due Monday, Tasks due the day after holidays, short notice changes with no corresponding change in due date...)"
good,"This is a great company to work for and one that does take care of its employees in general. For the younger professionals advance does not happen as quickly as they would like. As with any large and well established company there is a career progression based on years of service and some politics. There is a changing of the guard that is to occur within the next few years, but until that happens, your time served outweighs abilities."
good,"It was always a great place to work for and with people that cared, I would still be working there, but I had a family emergency and had to leave, I wish I was back there."
good,"Contract is not being renewed otherwise I would be staying put, a very good work atmosphere. Very good workplace culture, job was challenging but always supportive from management."
good,"NGC in Saint Augustine is dedicated to the E-2 Aircraft and Post Production Spares.  Because of the age of the E-2 Aircraft and the age of the platforms the NGC team supports, the job is not engineering focused.  The job is focused on meeting the operational needs of the fleet with the least amount of resources.  This can be challenging, but the work is not engaging from an engineering perspective."
good,Productive.  This is a great company to work for.  This company has excellent benefits.  This company believes work-life balance is important for its employees.
good,The job was handed to us when we got to work. Work was always steady and overtime was almost always available. Parking from the ships was a little far and the parking lots were always full.
good,Usually 9 hour days. Learned a lot about their processes and tools. Management is getting better. Culture and people are great. Hardest part of the job is getting stuck on something due to red tape. most enjoyable part is seeing a product work
good,"The teams at Northrop Grumman are like family. Many of the managers have been with NG for over 10 years. Their experience is very helpful when dealing with the clients. "
good,"This company offers Great education benefits. "
good,"Its a mans world there they are paid more for the same job Its based of the good ole boys club its sad but true however the benefits where great the facility was amazing gym, security cafeteria plenty of parking"
good,"I worked there for 7+ years in several roles.  Working in Government contracting is a rewarding experience, and I am glad for my time with NGC.  I would recommend it to any engineers looking for a challenge."
good,"Working for a big company can have its cons.   For example sequestration hit Northrop Grumman pretty hard, leading to forced job cuts.  People who worked well were even cut."
good,NG is a great org that's being held back by leadership that carries a very bureaucratic take to moving the company forward; very extreme legacy issues. I've seen people have no idea on how to do a job they were hired for. I've also witnessed more people being hired then people actually being promoted within.
good,Overall a good place.  AS sector has the 9/80 schedule which adds more 3 day weekends to the schedule.  Difficult for non engineers to progress.  People are generally good.  I think management cares but responses to employee concerns are slow.
good,"Northrop Grumman provided me with a with an environment that allowed me to learn and grow, early in my career.  I would recommend that anyone looking to get into the Aerospace industry give Northrop Grumman a look."
good,Being that it was my first job I learned a lot about work ethic. The managing personnel I felt like you could talk to. The job was never stressful and it was a great place to grow within a company.
good,I have enjoyed being part of the QEC project. Working with NGSM has providec good exposure to interesting challenges and different business functions.
good,"I worked for the advanced systems group in Norwalk,This gave me an opportunity  to  work in analyzing and assessing  new ideas. Made it very interesting.   But this may not be the case for rest of the company."
good,"All of my coworkers are amazing. The work ethic is good. The employee health plans and prescription drug coverage are good.  They are very good about promoting and recognizing good talent, though there are technical people in management positions who should not be."
good,They will let you start off as an apprentice and teach you what you need to know as far as your job. Its very hot in the summer and very cold in the winter. Traffic is slow when you leave work and its long walk to your work station when you get to work.
good,I am enjoy working there. The pay was better than Boeing. The managers were great. I am enjoy working for NASA space program. I just work there for seasonal work. I love to work for Northop Grumman
good,A typical day at work is a 12 hour day 6 days a week. You stay busy throughout the day. Good pay and plenty of hours. Need to be able to work overseas.
good,Not the best and certainly not the worst. I've heard from coworkers that the engineering sector is much better with how they run their operations overall.  Don't not expect to be treated any differently than a bum off of the street when applying to new positions. These conditions can change greatly depending on the program for which you work.
good,"Overall NGC isn't a bad company, the management staff in the southern California region is poor, they lack diversity and outwardly refuse to promote qualified women of color.  The majority white male management is not educated or business savvy to run the Unmanned program while keeping it on schedule and under/on budget.  Other competitors that are interested in the unmanned area go for it."
good,"The work is rewarding overall but the Management leaves quite a bit to be desired in some of the departments. Depending on the person and the Manager is whether you can even get advancement. By this I mean, your work doesn't matter, it's the person themselves that counts and not the work."
good,"Scheduled stripping, scrubbing, buffing, refinishing or sealing of different types of hard surfaced floors using appropriate equipment and chemicals. Scheduled carpet cleaning using approved methods and chemicals. Spot cleaning of carpets as needed. "
good,"Many options for lateral career moves and learning across multiple job functions, but variable upward mobility and support.  Coworkers, work environment, and job functions are excellent."
good,"Management is easy to work with , but managers are rotated on a regular basis, sometimes making it difficult to complete projects on time. Otherwise, the organization is supportive of your work and people are easy to get along with."
good,My work is done as a contractor at customer site. The contract work is unrewarding and advancement is nearly non existent.
good,"Enjoy working with like minded coworkers with similar backgrounds. Happy building proficiencies in three simulation systems.  Liked contributing to a successful team built of 75 type A personalities..  Enjoyed taking over in administration and building relationships with 100+ part time employees.  Getting them to the right place at the right time with pleasant accommodations.  "
good,"Do a little research and know what department you are getting into before making a jump in."
good,Algorithm development and implementation for radar platforms whose client is the air force. I work with a very nice and talented group. Most of them between the ages of 45-55. I am the youngest in the group at the age of 33. I love everything about the jobs accept the bureaucracy of the management and the poor compensation in my case. Where after a masters and a phd I am still making only $10k more than an entry level job.
good,"Northrop Grumman Corporation is a great place to start a career, many people there are overly willing to help assist to make the learning curve easier for projects. Friendly atmosphere, great people."
good,"Good company to work for, recommend for new grads.  Diversity and employee satisfaction is a primary focus for the CEO and upper management.  There is too many chains in the management ladder though which brings confusion and problems when major decisions are required to be made."
good,"Managed Supply Chain team for Various Govt "
good,"Contracted to customer site so environment is not NG. Considered a remote site. NG corp. good with communicating to employees. Good benefits. Co-workers are friendly. "
good,I have gained a great deal of experience with Northrop Grumman but i believe that my opportunities of advancement are now limited due to company restructuring and different directions.
good,"The culture is changing with the job market, but Northrop Grumman is a great place for a junior engineer to get started and get broad exposure to technology and engineering practices and principles. It's unique portfolio can give you access to many different areas such as Department of Defense, Health IT, and even Civil Engineering such as the support of Fire and Police Departments. "
good,Never had any problem while working. If I needed to know something or needed off. Then I just asked. Overall its an OK place to work. Just a little under paid.
good,"At the time I was working for them, shipbuilding was not a core principal of the company. Therefore, it was not prioritized in as a high priority."
good,"Working at Camp Lejeune for Northrop Grumman has been one of the most enjoyable jobs I have held.  Everyday is a new puzzle I must solve and it is gratifying to solve problems for the Marines and civilian workers.  I work at my own pace and feel a great sense of accomplishment when closing out my tickets.  "
good,"The management and co-workers all depends on what program you are assigned.  The last program I worked on here, I had the best manager that REALLY cared about his employees before he was laid off.  The co-workers really got along and were very helpful to each other.  The compensation is competitive but the benefits were lacking.  The rating would not let me give anything but 5 stars so I chose not to rate it at all."
good,"Owing to organizational structure, there are many business units which mostly act as independent units.  Little incentive for cooperative work relations between units.  Good pay/benefits. Like most publicly owned companies there is a ""what have you done for me lately"" feel from upper management.  Good training and educational opportunities. Within units the culture is determined by local management and front line leaders, most are good with employee and customer focus about right.  All in all it was a good place to work (many opportunities, mobility within company, leadership roles).....DoD budget cuts drove a ""greening"" of the workforce, but for 2 decades it was a good ride."
good,NG has is a very good place to work but the downside is advancement is not very good.  No chance to grow and develop. The people there are friendly and work environment is good.
good,"Worked 25 years in various sites. ."
good,Good company to work for nice co-workers and peers. Love the flexibility being able to work from home remote. Nice location and great work environment.
good,"Facilities Maintenance Manager. Aramark, 1995 to 2008. Assigned to Plant Operations and Facilities division of Northrop Grumman. Held contract P&L, budget and growth responsibilities. Oversaw all aspects of corrective and preventive maintenance operations. Reviewed/awarded contracts. Managed $5M budget and 85 employees."
good,"Favoritism to certain employees is noticeable "
good,"I think, generally the company is over managed (top Heavy), and, since most products are provided by Vendors, the Engineering technical Knowledge is below average.  A lot of Technical Documentation contains too much boiler plate data and not enough technical substance.  I received many bonuses and great pay raises for rescuing programs that were failing because of waste, incompetence, and uninformed management."
good,A good place to work with great people.  The Azusa plant that I worked at was focused on Aerospace defense contracts.  The work was interesting and important.  The company strongly supports diversity within the company and also participates in community outreach activities such as high school science mentoring and Christmas shoe box presents.
good,"From my office, I conducted research on projects that dealt specifically with human integration design techniques.  Supplied cost-benefit-anlayes to department manager on potential projects of interest.  Attended various meetings, met individually with engineers with whom I worked on specific projects, particularly as concerned design and development issues."
good,Great place to work from the employees to management.  I worked there 31 years.
good,My only wish is the implementation of flexible work schedule.
good,"Most days after I get into work I scan my emails and I am ready to talk to my Manager & go over the list of pressing issues of the day and also provide feedback on the previous day’s work. Highlight any possible issues that can crop up or has already come up and update him on my priority list. "
good,Northrop Grumman is a great company to work for. Unfortunately Northrop Grumman ES does not specialize in the area of Information Assurance so there is no room for growth or advancement in Information Assurance
good,"A typical day at work included at least one project related technical meeting and a multitude of software engineering tasks.  I worked with great professionals and friends in a team environment.  We maintained ground support software and databases for a key military defense satellite system.  As project team leader, the hardest, but many times most enjoyable part of the day was ensuring effective communication with team members and stakeholders. I learned how to effectively manage software project teams and their processes and products.  The people I worked with as well as the importance of our mission made this an excellent place to work."
good,"Great benefit. Everyday is challenging, There are many places to eat, exercise, which I love to do during my lunch breaks.  "
good,"A typical day at Georgia Pedimont  Technical  College is working with young adults on basic web design structure in a classroom setting."
good,"Building ships is exactly what you would think.  Tough, hot, long days...  Even working in engineering is hot.  Not due the temperature, but the pressure that is put on everyone to make cost and schedule requirements.  In shipyards today, it is a very tough and challenging environment to meet the tight budget and schedule constraints.  The benefits is that everyday you are working on a product that will be around for 30-50 years defending our country and protecting our soldiers."
good,"Job security"
good,I enjoy working in Northrop Grumman the working atmosphere is very professional and friendly. I've learned many technical skills from my  position at Northrop.The current fiscal environment; as well as acquisition processes pose challenges to NG growth and opportunity space within the local area. I really enjoyed my tenure at Northrop Grumman.
good,"I had a wonderful boss. He always keeep me posted on what i needed to know, and keep me busy with tasks that built my career. I worked closedly with a variety of differnt groups when coordinating trade shows, etc."
good,"Learned a lot about Aerospace engineering, a very friendly environment, an agenda was always laid out and people continued to look for my best interest."
good,"I really enjoyed my tenure at Northrop Grumman.  I traveled between two sites.  One of the sites was the Aerospace Engineering site and the other site was the manufacturing site so I could get my feel of what things were with the engineers and go to the manufacturing site and see the fruition of it."
good,"Excellent opportunity to expand understanding of engineering principles governing design, development, testing, production, fielding, sustainment and process improvement. Management provides you the tools necessary to complete your assigned duties, but the lack of a comprehensive training plan for a particular discipline forces one to learn about that subject from others and through self-initiative. The majority of co-workers are exceptional, some aren't so accommodating or very helpful at all. The hardest part about the aerospace industry is, its cyclical.  If government spending is reduced for a particular program, always be prepared and take the opportunity to expand your knowledge in areas outside primary craft. The most enjoyable part of about a job is the people you work with."
good,Aerospace and Defense industry is dynamically changing. Northrop Grumman focuses on outstanding performance and high quality for its customers.
good,Solid management and great benefits. Often times the hours were too long but the workload was fair and educational.
good,"The program I worked on at NG was fast paced, working with cutting edge technology and results driven.  Those who were able to complete difficult tasks and produced results were recognized and given more responsibility."
good,There are so many brilliant people that work at Northrop Grumman. I'm amazed every day at some of the things we are able to accomplish.
good,"My recent position as Information Technology Management involved the evaluation of IT products currently used by the largest Virginia state agencies, VDOT and DMV. Working directly with the agencies and their IT Managers, collected requirements, I delivered complete RFP’s to my team of subject matter experts. I performed as Project Manager supporting the development of new VDOT installations in Lexington, Salem Virginia and a technology corridor for numerous sites in northern Virginia. In addition, I worked closely with a DMV sub-contractor, Canadian Bank Note, to plan the implementation of the Secure Driver’s License/Identification Card System infrastructure."
good,Northrop Grumman has a Great Environment with Good People.
good,"Northrop Grumman's best asset is the employees. NG hires the smartest and most talented professionals, which creates a wonderful collaborative environment. I was able to learn so much from my co-workers that before long I was in a position to lend my expertise to other employees as well."
good,Enjoyed working with my co workers. However my manager wasnt a great leader
good,"NGC is a great place to work. professional and managment listens. Job Culture is getting better. just needs to loosen the tie a bit more.  overall you can do well but keep motivated,"
good,My five years there were mostly enjoyable.  The work situation was comfortable and the co-workers were nice.
good,"Northrop Grumman is a very large, primarily defense contractor. The company does have niche business in other areas such as healthcare IT. As an employer, the benefits are what you expect from a Fortune 500 company. The company in recent years has put a lot of energy into employee engagement, wellness programs and has a robust self directed development program. My experience is that the company is very program/project-driven, and it is hard to really identify with even the sector much less the overall company as an entity."
good,"Good Company. Have not worked there in 5 plus years."
good,"I worked for Northrop Grumman for 25 years.  Coordinated Navy Commissioning Ceremonies for from 2,500 to 25,000 in attendance.  Worked with local committees to ensure all milestones are on track.  Date entry of names and addresses, data base management.  Designed, ordered and mailed invitations, tickets and parking information.  Received and processed RSVP's. High volume of phone calls.  Provided excellent customer service and have received several awards and letters of appreciation from the customer."
good,This company gave me many options and oportunities to learn multiple projects.
good,for a shipyard that deals with the government contracts they had inadiquite materials and machines
good,"Unload trucks in correct order (space was a big issue) and confirm that all material is present and not damaged. Some days I would unload all day but if I had a light delivery day I would assist the install team and build the FSS machine. I learned about team work, the job was 100% travel and the team I was on would be the only people I knew for hundreds of miles. We were together 60-70 hours a week working and would also hang out outside of work. My co-workers were great people and we worked great together. The managers were also good people who took care of employees and any problems that came up. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the customer who was the United States Post Office. They would have some ridiculous demands but the customer is always right and we would accommodate to anything they wanted. I enjoyed the travel, I was able see places that I never would have gone to."
good,"Was a great place to work, until they decided to close our facility."
good,Northrop Grumman promotes a strong sense of ethics starting with Senior Management and provides opportunities to employees who want it.
good,Due to the Sequestration....I do my best to stay busy and have a productive day.  Mainly have to wait daily to see what each day holds.  I am very knowledgeable in my position and pretty much can handle every and all travel situations that may develop from our travelers.  I am part of a two-person team.  I enjoy helping each and every one of my travelers as I have been assigned.
good,Northrop Grumman give you an opportunity to move within the different branches; great company to find your career path.  
good,Great place to work except during times of government austerity/cutbacks.
good,"As a C-RAM operator, I feel that our job in theater is probably one of the most important. We are the first line of defense against indirect fire. The training provided by Northrop Grumman was more than adequate."
good,"Typically, I reviewed tasks with staff, walked the building greeting other staff and began work on administrative and operational paperwork.  Communicated with other company managers to determine their requirements and discuss any difficulties."
good,"Great Benefits, people are great to work with.  The pace is slow at times and there are cultural issues that collide with the need to be a cutting edge inovative company"
good,"Highly recommend as a great place to work. Great benefits, flexible hours."
good,"It's not your typical work environment, as the place looks a little like an army barracks. I was a Math major so this was not really up my alley, but they do some pretty great stuff. The life cycle can be long, so that can be frustrating, but the people are nice and the benefits are good. The only bad thing is depends on whose in office (read: Democrats are not good for the job or your career as they pull funds) and if there is a war (as this pulls money from research & development and all the fun stuff to the troops). Contrary to popular opinion DoD government contractors make more money in peace time. Overall a great job if you're a software/electrical embedded software engineer and good at what you do."
good,Great company to work for.
good,"A typical day involves checking email, doing some programming, and testing software. There is a lot of process and focus on providing software which works the first time."
good,"A good company to work for every one is very freindly and goal oriented. management and co workers are helpfull at solveing problems and will take time out of their day to help you. Job training is very thorough and detailed. crosstraining in different areas is highly encoraged although promotions are far and few inbetween. this job in perticular is not the most interesting job and the daily tasks can feel very mundane at times, this job can also be very fustrating when something goes wrong. the management will usaly help you through this"
good,"worried I made wrong decision at first, got much better roughly 2 years in...got opportunity to interact directly with customers, and I got a chance to travel, which I enjoy! Great co-workers, management ""tried"", severely hand-cuffed by corporate..Benefits expensive..."
good,Challenging; able to problem solve; talented co-workers; hardest & most enjoyable is issue resolution & implementation
good,"Great team to work with, challenging opportunities and an overall satisfying job."
good,"I did lots of busy work, but all in all they paid good, had good benefits and plenty of job security."
good,I enjoy what I do to support the Team efforts.
good,"Great work environment, challenging technical goals, family feeling to the workplace."
good,basically it was just like working in any metal shop just with much more strict rules and regulations
good,"If you love to travel, working in University Relations is the place to be at NGC. You will be able to develop your communication, networking and presentation skills as you become part of Industry Advisory Boards, guest speakers and a partner in the hiring process."
good,"Exxon/mobil walk down p&id drawing,update mark-ups. Using auto cadd and bentiley 2000 software"
good,"Typical day of work ws basic banking, check cashing & cash handling. While here i learned alot about credit & credit scores & what impacts them both positively & negatively as well as loading loans & things to look for as far as approving or denying loan applications. Great working enviroment Enjoyed my coworkers and the bonds & level of trust we built with one another. There really was no ""Hard Part"" to the job, as long as you know banking then you basically know what to expect on a day-to-day but the most enjoyable part would have to be speaking with and building repoire with the members of the credit union."
good,I get to delight customers regularly; nature of overall work and autonomy is subject to federal employees as a contractor.
good,Enjoyed the experience. Liked my position. Enjoyed working 3rd shift. Fit my family's lifestyle. Went a little overboard with diversity issues.
good,Title says it all. It depends on the location and the contract.
good,"The company offered a 9/80 work schedule, which is great. They offer flexible work hours and telecommuting. There are layers of bureaucracy in management which makes it difficult to enact change. The most enjoyable part of the job is working on the incredible projects and programs."
good,I learned mostly about security and maintaining company based protocols. The workplace was fun but professional with management not being overbearing unless you just weren't doing your work.
good,"Flexible schedules, remote options, and education assistance. Management is okay. This year, the company has gotten better with communicating the strategy."
good,Great company to work for. There are challenges like any other company. Every program is different. There is a very diverse workforce from the bottom to top.
good,came in did your work everyone willing to haelp if needed. Had to fix problems as well as be able to over come new problems. hardest part was never having the same problem twice so each time there was a problem it was something new
good,"You earn paid time off and its your time so take it when you want. Everybody is willing to work with you. "
good,"It was good job. Downside was benefits like vacation. Had to work full year to get just 5 days of PTO. I’ve heard they’ve loosened reigns of culture since. Such as now you can have camera phone in workplace. Parking in morning to get to work was insane. 20,000 employees yo would think they’d have more than enough parking with all the money they make. Not the case. I actually loved my crew. A second family."
good,"The environment was very professional. Processes are very rigorous, as is attention to getting details right. Quality assurance on programs very tight. Capture reviews are very detail oriented. Shipley-based capture methodology very comprehensive."
good,"As a contracts intern, the typical work day was centered around the work desktop managing various different contract database tasks. One of the main tasks I was given during my brief time at Northrop was to fill up a new online database for veteran employees to have more immediate access to the files they required. This work essentially required nothing more than renaming every file and folder to fit within a certain naming convention, before uploading individual folders to the database. This went on for multiple months as the central task under my purview. It was far from glamorous, but the people were so kind and welcoming and always happy to help. There was likely a path for progressing beyond simple tasks like that, but the work was not for me in particular. Still, very warm work environment."
good,Good people and interesting work. Management cares about the average employee. Very   interesting work and very good benefits. A very diversified company with a great future
good,I found my time at Northrop Grumman to be a good experience. I learned a lot about the principles and practices of the organization. NG is a large organization with many opportunities for upward advancement in the company.
good,"position held was telework authorized.  very flexible schedule.  provided me with all the necessary tools to perform my daily duties from home.  work cell phone, computer, mifi device etc,"
good,"An employee can grow so much in this company. It requires precision, patience and motivation to get the job done perfectly (with no mistakes). It's possible to work your way up the ranks fast, but it'll require a tremendous amount of hard work."
good,"Northrop Grumman is an excellent company to work for, and my experience - in my two different positions - has been very positive overall.  I would highly recommend Northrop Grumman as an employer."
good,"I received parts from a Fed-X location or a UPS location. I received job assignments through messages. I managed my own day for the most part, after that."
good,"I was an intern and it was my first internship and it was a good first time experience. I didn't do hardly any software even though I was considered a SW intern. Never the less, a good learning experience."
good,"Plusses: "
good,"I enjoyed my time at Northrop Grumman  it just needed to pay like the other airplane companys and have some sort of retirement plan for all employees I was hired to fix engines ,propellers, to do phases and preventive maintance on E-2C and C-2A  aircraft."
good,Your experience may be different. Each site on government contracting may be different depending on how the supervision is.  Make sure you ask questions during an interview.
good,This is not as stressful as other companies. They are family oriented and very understanding. You can have your phone with you as long as you get your job completed.
good,"Northrop’s employee development programs and processes are designed to strengthen employee skills, encourage knowledge transfer and support career advancement and movement. At Northrop, all development activities are guided by following key principles. Leaders are responsible for developing and growing talent for the enterprise. Each employee is accountable for his or her own individual job performance, for adapting to business changes and "
good,"All the good things you hear about this company is true. Benefits are excellent. I just want to mention all the bad things. First is that it's true the company is a defense contractor, therefore it is necessary to jump companies to advance your career. Second, the company is susceptible to over-engineer products in order to try and ""find more work"" or ""look good"" to the customer. This produces more waste and costly product, but good for NG. More money for us. These are the things that bother me most. Otherwise, a great place to work."
good,"Good company for benefits, treat people fairly, no promotion.  Good places to work and will recommend to others.  Good work/life balance and management is a hit and miss just like any other place.  Must keep up certifications and they tend to get more Govt. work then commercial"
good,morning roll call and then go to my work station. I learned nothing. They were not big on career development. The management was not concerned with the work schedule. They were more concerned on body count. The hardest part of the job was being told to slow down because I was working to fast. Their was nothing enjoyable about the job. this is why I left
good,"Sperry - Fast paced, hard work, physically demanding, poor US management support, good people to support MSE's."
good,NG is a great place for students to begin their career though (depending on the location) some sites do not offer as much advancement opportunities as others.
good,Great Experience
good,"Overall, NG is a great place to work at. Like most defense engineering companies, the work ebbs and flows. Raises are yearly, but promotions are slow."
good,"Northrop Grumman is a collection of several other companies that has created one of the largest Defense and Space Corporations in the US.  It is very diversified, with a broad line of products.  As a working environment, the company strives to be competitive with other similar companies maintaining an excellent working experience."
good,My experience here has been great. I'm currently in a 3 year professional development rotation. This has given me the opportunity to learn as i go while still developing my skill sets for future endeavors.
good,"Laid off with no rehire.  I really liked working there.  Tested mechanical systems such as steering, chilled water, heated windows and so on, on US Aircraft carriers."
good,I'm currently on a contract that does not allow me to add value to the team or company.  We're just a number and I feel like a gloried administrative assistant
good,Great place to learn and build upon your career. Flexible hours and great work environment.  Management usually pushes for educational growth which is always good.
good,"My time at Northrop Grumman was good. I worked for good people and WITH good people."
good,"Great company overall. Great pay. Great management. Co-workers ehhh, but great worklife balance. Many growth opportunities. "
good,"-Managed assets inventory and deployed custom PC images to end users based on customer criteria. "
good,"I have been with NG for 14 years and have had many different roles, and always had great managers. Benefits are good. I love the work that NG does to keep our military safe."
good,I began my career at Northrop Grumman now Huntington Ingalls in 2002 and I was a x 11 ship fitter where I learned quite a bit about steel carpentry. Welding torch applications blueprint reading as well as on-the-job-training various skills that I learn from quite a few skilled veterans. I also was loaned out to another department of x-33 why I acquired a few more skills far as insulation deck tile work clean up pumping and also Marine painting. I learned to hone my skills and crafts to perform any job or task given to me and succeed and completion in a timely manner while passing inspections and being quite knowledgeable of my skill set and work true safety meetings training and classroom qualifications to complete the job safely.
good,Northrop is a good company but at Schriever Air Force Base we did not always have access to company management. We would only see them when the company need something from us.
good,"working for Northrup has been a wonderful experience, since this is the first big aerospace company I have worked for and have heard so many good things about others in this area just want to feel things out on the outside to see what else is out there."
good,Great benefits. I served 28 years with this company only wish I could have retired from there. If i had the chance I would love to return there. Great working environment.
good,"Co-workers are like family, focus on diversity, employees encouraged to pursue further education and mentoring, extensive corporate oversight and adherence to procedures"
good,I worked for Northrop Grumman as a government contractor.  I do not wish to give a review at this time.  My experience with them was positive.  I would recommend this company to work for.
good,Northrop Grumman is a solid place to work with nice benefits. Management is aging and they know it and so they are willing to give opportuinityes to younger indiciuals
good,"The work is overall slow paced, decent pay, but you can only go far if you play the game. If you're not a crowd favorite you will get stepped on and overlooked."
good,"work life balance is driven by the size of the campus where you work. opportunities for advancement are there, but political rather than performance based."
good,"Management is really good about communicating with there employees and understanding about family and time management."
good,"It is a good working environment the people are all professional. They taught me the value of hard work and how to communicate properly to one another with respect and honesty. The management is a good example of how the business should be done, with proper communication and how to gain the trust of each employee. The productivity is quite excellent at its best. The most enjoyable part of the job is the company' gatherings. You will meet a lot of interesting people and how well diverse the culture and they combine their ideals to one one another. It is a very effective way on how people share their ideas and belief. I commute from San Diego to Los Angeles and that took time to travel. My wife was not quite adapted on my situation, I made the choice to move back to San Diego to be able to raise my family."
good,I worked there for just over a year having started as a temp to hire. I enjoyed the continuous learning opportunities the company provided. I was surrounded by supportive and helpful co-workers.
good,"In the short time i worked here, I learned alot about management skill as a lead man. i started as a 2nd class and moved up to leadman. I was the second leadman on my crew."
good,"I was hired as an intern there for about a year."
good,A total professional environment exists within the organization.  Management involved in the career advancement of its employees.  Career coursework is made available to staff.
good,It's a job.  They do what they can to help.  I enjoy working there. I wish the matching on 401K was better.  I feel forcing me to write about this company is is a bit much.
good,"Great place to work!"
good,"Great place to work and have on your resume. "
good,"The people are really down to earth and you feel like you are really contributing. They relocated to Florida, so there is no longer a big presence in Bethpage."
good,"Interning at Northrop Grumman was rather slow-paced. Any task that was given to me was always given with the added quirk of taking as long as I needed. Honestly, think that they just did not have enough work for the interns to do so they tried to elongate the little they had. I would finish everything sooner than expected and would have to wait 3-5 days to get another assignment. What did I do in between that time? Signed up for every possible activity on site from building a miniature launchpad to ping pong tournament to hackathon style challenges."
good,"Northrop Grumman was a good place to work however they had taken on a smaller company, Sterling Software, which I was a part of. I would have preferred to stay with a smaller company- but really NG didn't effect me much. I was offsite a Lockheed Martin in a SCIF."
good,"the environment was quite, not much direction on work done well or not, overall good place to work not the worst in my book, Only left because of my father's illness"
good,"I typically made rounds, ensured that all safety and security regulations were being followed.  It was always interesting, something different may come up daily.  Management cared about the employees.  Long hours, even when I was home worked on things after hours. I enjoyed working with people at the site."
good,Working at Northrop really make you proud.  The project that you're working on help to protect our country.  The technology is both legacy and modern.
good,I enjoyed working at NGC until they laid off our division of 823 people. I was left to supervise my install crew with little interference from upper management. I really enjoyed the job while it lasted.
good,"Good pay, flexibility is great, work from home options.  Well known and secure company.  Opportunities to try new things and stretch your skills.  Training opportunities are rovided."
good,"For the most part, I have had great experiences as an employee of NG.  They have helped significantly with the advancement of my career.  Like with all life experiences, there is the occasional bad one, but at NG those are the exception rather than the rule."
good,"Northrop Grumman has great benefits, and good people to work around. Hard to move up because people like the company so much that they won't retire, but I would definitly recommend so one to work there."
good,"Company has great rotational culture; you can find yourself in supply chain, business development, finance, rates / budgets rotations every 2 years. You can go as far as you want, if you do good work."
good,"Was a great place to work, mostly because I worked with the best people.  Smart, kind, gracious, helpful."
good,A good company to work for. It's a team working environment. I like helping the soldiers teaching how to use the logistics program so they can use down range.
good,"look...Northrop is a great place to work and I've spent many of my years there, so i'm not going to give you a ""my typical day"" because this thing would be a novel. I can tell you that Northrop has a large collective of management that all strives for the company's goals and achievements in the aerospace industry to be number 1, so....that makes for very stressed out individuals....and a lot of them. i guess what i'm saying is management is good but not the greatest. workplace culture....quality, customer satisfaction, leadership, integrity, people, teamwork. Now that all those sound good, it really is like high school clicks or groups, but it seems to come together when it needs to so the job can get done. Hardest part of the job is the commitment to stress...more often than not, not really the best balance, when you try to find some it seems that your trying to get away. The most enjoyable part and the one thing that kept me going.....the great people that work there, it does seem to out number the others, i say out number...there are more technicians and support functions there with great people, which far out number the others."
good,Northrop Grumman has bought up many companies over the years including TRW. Their benefits are not quite as good another companies I've worked for.  Raises are not quite as good either though perhaps times are tough right now.
good,"Good company with excellent benefits.  Recently making big improvements in career planning and personnel management, with functional managers put in charge of employee development.  Salaries sometimes lag behind market but this seems to be improving as well.  I am able to flex hours and telecommute one or two days weekly, but this flexibility may vary depending what program you are working on."
good,Northrop is a great place to work.  The pay was okay and you get as much overtime as you like.  They don't discriminate with the workers and the work isn't that hard. You just have to be really careful and play close attention to the work.
good,Working for Northrop  has been a great experience and a learning experience as how business is run on a manufacturing level.  Coming from a manufacturing background it has been an eyeopening experiencing working on the business side
good,"I have been with Northrop a total of 15 years. I have left and returned a few times through corporate buyouts. Overall my experiences with Northrop have been pretty good,"
good,"Good place to work. In this organization it is all about who you know and not what you know for some of the more technical fields. Make sure that before you start work, you get paid what you would like to get paid because later it will be hard to get desired pay."
good,"As lead designer/integration specialist on a prototype aircraft crew station and canopy, I worked closely with other groups and found them to be very knowledgeable and helpful. The management team was well respected by all. Most had been military test pilots with experience in the design and development of military aircraft thus they understood the issues unique to aircraft development. The work environment was professional and fast paced. The most enjoyable part of the job was production and presentation of various design concepts in the weekly inter-discipline meetings."
good,"A great position to learn about a wide range of programs and applications since we provided support for so many. Generally, a laid back work environment."
good,A great company to work for with many opportunities in differing fields.  Corporate leadership is fabulous setting the right tone for the company.  Most divisions are good however some are mired politics.
good,The work/life balance at Northrop Grumman was great. You were able to take off on the days that you want and were able to work from home when you needed to. The management was mainly the issue at the location I was at. Some managers were able to manage projects accordingly and give development teams a chance at success but most of the time that was not the case. There was very little push back on client requests that were out of scope or would not be able to deliver on time. So a lot of over promising and under delivering was going on. The projects that were available were meaningful and you felt like you were going to impact a lot of people with your work.
good,great technology company.  But relies on Government contracts to maintain business growth.  Susceptible to changes in Washington. Cutting defense spending causes layoffs.
good,"Good work life balance with competitive wages. The work is interesting and challenging. This campus still has a small company vibe to it with a relaxed attitude and a focus on keeping a safe, enjoyable work environment for everyone."
good,"Great company, great benefits, and great people. I would have continued to work there if there wasn't so many cuts in funding to our program during that time."
good,I ran the IT dept at our local site to include 3 others on staff. I learned self management and leadership skills. I had no management on site but had weekly meetings via Teleconference.The job was in a classified area and required many rules before any work could be done. My favorite part of the job was helping my co-workers with their information needs.
good,"Working for Northrop Grumman was a wonderful part of my Life.  I learn so much in the Defense industry.  My growth was up to me and I did. They gave me the wings to fly and was there to catch me when I fell. I seen them as my extended family.  We work together as a team, communicate as a unit, all ways push for the best."
good,"Northrop Grumman hired me with my BA being contingent and gave me ample opportunity! I love the company, although the pay scale I low. I think they could also do more work in the growth department as I have expressed expansion and personal growth several times and it seemed I hit a ceiling with not only no growth opportunity but now increase in salary (besides the yearly 2-3%) or bonus, ever."
good,"A demanding, but not an overbearing workplace.  "
good,Typical days were somewhat long.  Average about 50 hours per week.  (No overtime / salary).  They will give you as much responsibility as you are willing to take on.
good,"Well paying job in the defense industry. Opportunities to work on sophisticated military aircraft systems with high level engineers and professionals. Unfortunately, the work was subject to congressional budgets which made the employment short or inconsistent."
good,"Had some great co-workers"
good,"must know how to use a computer well, to work at this company, due to the heavy usage of it. also, it has a relaxed environment, which makes it's an awesome workplace."
good,The employees were like family to work with. The manager I worked under was a micro manager and would watch your IM constantly and if it changed to show you away from your desk he would come by and see if you were really gone. It is my understanding that manager is no longer there and his replacement is wonderful.
good,"Great Benefits package, good healthcare offering, look out for employees, help with educational benefits,  401k offerings, good workplace culture and work life balance"
good,A comfortable work environment with great co-workers. The atmosphere was never hostile of chaotic. Supervisors were very helpful and care about their employees.
good,"The company is a good place to work. I enjoy working with the team of hardworking professionals. There is flexibility in the schedule, making work life balance a very good thing."
good,Company cares about employees. Hard to get promoted without reaching the minimum amount of years. Fast paced and the people are always friendly and are willing to help you learn
good,"Enjoyed working for Northrop Grumman.  However, personal dislikes have caused me being laid off and not being picked up by the new contract..  I have strong work ethics and hardly ever taken time off from my job.  My job performance is superior.  Even in difficult times on the job, I continued to do my job in a professional manner and make sure the Mission was completed.."
good,"I worked for a contractor.  Great job, as a contractor, would be execellent as Northrop employee.  Execellent working benefits and retirement program."
good,"The organization was revamping with a new CEO, new CFO, many new hires as a result of many departures, staff changing departments, management changes, and still adjusting to a major system conversion 2 years ago. It seemed to be working through the adjustment but lost a large part of itself in the process...the fun of working there."
good,"I've worked for Northrop Grumman for quite some time.  The people that I worked with are great. They have a nice 9/80 schedule, which allows every other friday off."
good,"A typical day at work for me is I can work 9 hour days and take one day off per work period. So, every other Friday I had as an off day.  The workplace were I work is very help.  Everyone helps each other rather than compete with each other.  This part of the job is very enjoyable.  I sometimes get to work remotely from home."
good,"This is a company that values its employees as assets and provides a lot of extras for its employees and their families."
good,"This is a military workplace, all work policy and procedures are veryregimented.  Diverse enviornment, very involved with community affairs. I learned many other aspects of what my job entailed as part of a whole picture. Management was constantly changing which at times was a distraction for connecting with staff."
good,"Never dealt much with the company itself. Worked from home and traveled as directed by my supervisor,  Was only with the company for about 3 months."
good,"This is a pretty good place to work. I really liked the environment. The hardest part of the job, is pleasing the inspectors. They are extremely particular."
good,"I stay busy, but coming from a totally different employment history, its very difficult to get advanced. The people are friendly and willing to help with questions"
good,"this is a great place to work if you enjoy being on the move all the time and interacting with NAVSEA and NEXTGEN folks.  this would be the perfect job for you.  Depending on what department your in or who you know and how well you interact with others, will depict on your growth in the company."
good,Excellent workplace environment. There's nothing to complaint about the company. Everyone seems to be content with their role.
good,"Good summer internship, thought they had a hard time dedicating meaningful work to interns, this seemed to vary from manager to manager. If you looked and asked how you can help you had a better opportunity to be successful."
good,It was and educational experience and its time to move on. I would like to expand my knowledge in an new environment I enjoy learning new processes and would like to explore new opportunity's to help progress the welfare of each company's future as well as myself.
good,The working environment at Northrop Grumman was exceptional and the co-workers were very easy to get along with. Time management was of paramount importance and there was a great time keeping system to keep you on track throughout your work day.
good,"Recommend working here. "
good,"The Management was great until the contract ended, they were very vague about whether people would keep their positions or be let go. Day to day was laid back and satisfying."
good,"The job is difficult and you really need to know your stuff because it is a very cut throat environment. When in a meeting or making a decision, you need to be able to give a response to answer a question and be 100% confident that its the right course of action because if it isn't, you very well might be dispensable and replaced within the next 48 hours. Very rewarding for those who go above and beyond."
good,"Loved my job, great boss"
good,"I enjoyed working for Northrop Grumman."
good,"enjoyed working for all"
good,"Good co-worker"
good,I have not worked anyplace that was as well run as Northrop Grumman TASC.  Processes were well defined and communication was clear and constant.
good,"Files, Phones, correspondenc, etc."
good,I learned many new skills and trades in the mechanical field. I worked In harsh work environments and maintained focus and was able to complete all tasks. I worked with a diverse group and built strong relationships. I moved up from a laborer all the way to tactical vehicle trades helper in my 5 years there. I am very grateful for the experience I was able to obtain while working there.
good,"On my particular contract, the culture is very good, but the work balance is pretty bad. I'm continuously in a position where I bring home work with me and can never release/relax."
good,"I was an Administrative Assistant for the Contracts Department.  I maintained Government/Commercial Contract files for our Department.  We were subject to ISO audits at any time, for the years that I was there, we passed the audits each time!!  Very good pay, hard work and I was always learning."
good,Northrop was a productive company to work for with a lot of experienced people in a lot of diverse backgrounds. As an individual you could gain in knowledge and experience.
good,"Fast paced position which is challenging, rewarding, and expectations are high.  Management assigns employees to various work groups that are mixed with all levels of employees to create a positive working team environment.  All employees are valued."
good,Most people come into the company through a Temp Agency and MAY stay on with the agency after initial first contract. Pay with Temp Agency is good though!!
good,Ilearned tons of information and skills that opened a lot of doors for my future. I obtained a fork lift operating certificate and learned how to use military numerial systems.my co workers were very helpful and my supervisiors were more than willing to lend a helpful hand in me achieving my career goals
good,"I have a positive outlook on the company as a whole, recent contract changes have reduced salary. I work with a small group of professionals. There has been a contract shift which has reduced the salaries by 20%."
good,"The work was challenging, but satisfying. Management was very supportive, and encourage professional growth and development."
good,"My final days, prior to retirement, were very rewarding.  I was involved in a special project regarding the B-2, Stealth Bomber.  Long hours with the team resulted in resolving the issue."
good,"NG as a company is very good..."
good,Overall I would say it is a great company to work for. They invest in their employees and encourage personal growth. There are a lot of opportunities to transfer or relocate.
good,A good company to work for relative to benefits and support. The people I worked with were very helpful and encouraged me to progress through new assignments.
good,"Worked for a short time for NG as a temp. Great Environment, Great People. Very flexible when it came to family needs. Really enjoyed working with this company."
good,This company generally tries to keep their employees employed even if the contract they were on does not get renewed. They do their best to find another spot for you within the organization.
good,"Northrop has a great job culture, benefits set, and resources for learning and development.  However, advancement basically works as such: to get a higher level position within your team, you must already be performing to such a capacity. Also, at any point beyond entry level jobs, NG doesn't pay competitively; a level 2 pays worse than a similar position requiring 2 years of experience elsewhere, level 3 worse than a position requiring 5 years, etc."
good,i mostly stayed to myself at avondale. I had a few relatives who worked out there who showed me the ropes. I learned a lot about pulling cable and Fiber optics out there.
good,Manage the day to day program for a major ACAT-1 program supporting cloud based repositories.  Program supports thousands of users across the IC.
good,"Overall good company to work for. Work is extremely interesting and fulfilling. If you work hard you will be rewarded and given opportunities to advance. Long days can be expected, especially when on programs with critical schedules."
good,Management team is great. The co-worker are very helpful and close. I was laid off due to contract reduction but would turn down higher paying jobs to work with them again. That should say it all.
good,"As long as you got your work done, you were able to flex your hours."

good,"I enjoyed the variety of jobs and most of the coworkers were friendly & easy to get along with."
good,"Love working with Soldiers as well as doing maintenance. working 7 to 4 is a great schedule. First time working with union employees was a great learning experience. Co-workers were for the most part good, but at times it could be a dog eat dog scenario."
good,"Weld"
good,"Most co-workers were great.  Some managers were good, others need help.  I worked a Govt contract.  You're at the mercy of the contract.  I would recommend them as an employer if you can handle the stress of the contract."
good,"Northrop is a supportive environment and a beautiful campus. Coworkers are cooperative and good people.  There are plenty of opportunities there for growth.  The hardest part of the job is when they down size and are short people with the same workload."
good,Lots of opportunities for growth in my field.  I work with a wide variety of other work disciplines allowing me to know the depth of my job from many angles. The management is easy to work with.

After being handed your work assignment-It's time to go get the job done.  I have learned to become a good ndt inspector and my management pushes me to be the best I can be.

I was promoted regularly, was given increasingly more challenging assignments, and was given every opportunity to learn and grow professionally and personally. I worked with and for many talented people, many of whom I formed close professional and personal relationships. If not for the economic downturn in 2008-2009, I'd still be working at NG."

good,"Northrop is largely a system engineering production integration and test house. San Diego, where I was, and the corporate executive levels, recently youthanized; displaced knowledgeable experienced employees in favor of dumbed down youth. Unfortunately, this is often a predecessor to demise, which I hope does not happen. Diminishing contracts will probably mean takeover, so there is considerable padding & parachuting going on among high level execs."

In this position,I am responsible for supporting the USPS IT Strategy and Compliance office as the first line liaison between IT Strategy and Compliance and the IT Operations business units providing consistent communication in the area of compliance policies, procedures, and communication.

good,I've had phenomenal success here and so can everyone else in the industry. The key to doing great here is to empower others through positive relationships and being supportive.
good,"Northrop was a great place to work, especially at the Linthicum MD location.  The people have a wealth of experience and once you have the right manager, you can really grow your career."
good,A typical day at work can be adventurous at times. Frustrating but also at time satisfying. I believe management overall is pretty good and most of the managers generally care about their employees improving and having the careers that they want. The hardest part about the job is not everyone helping each other to be the best they can be. The most enjoyable part of the day for me is being able to look at all the cool planes and knowing that you played an intricate part in getting them mission capable and ready to fly.
good,"The company has a great culture. My work time is very flexible. So if something unexpected in life comes up I know it won't be a big deal if I need to take a day or 2 handle it. "
good,Working with Northrop was a great experience and the overall experience was a great career opportunity. The company offered several options to cross train or unilaterally opportunities.
good,"Northrop Grumman serves a critically important mission, and the employees in all lines of business come to work daily with this in mind. As a defense contractor, an emphasis is put on their engineering professionals and on research and development. Those who climb the latter within the company do so backed by concurrent business and engineering backgrounds. Management is receptive to feedback and communicative."
good,"While the compensation is not elite, the work life balance and job security is unmatched. Advancement will be merited and not given, so overall I would say it is very fair. The day to day duties may not be the most exciting but you wouldn't expect them to be in such a highly regulated industry"

good,"Northrop Grumman is a really great place to work. If you have a passion for aviation, and knowing what exactly you are working on Northrop Grumman is the place."
good,"I've worked at a couple of different locations.  From what I've seen, it's a toss up as to what the environment, management, funding, and experience are all like.  Since it is a defense contractor, you are subject to whatever contracts your department/location is awarded.  This can heavily affect your experience.  If there is a lot of down time at your site it can be very daunting."
good,"NGC, at a local level, stands by and supports its personnel.  Pay is competitive and work conditions are good.  Supervisors and Department Heads are fair.  Most of the contact and support is oriented directly to Government Leads."

good,I had a wonderful time working for Northrop Grumman. It was an great working experience that I have learned so much from. The only reason I left this company was they lost the contract. I would go back and work for them if I was afforded the opportunity.
good,"The overall feel of the workplace was very corporate and cold, but there were amenities available that helped to keep people engaged. The job itself could be both rewarding and challenging depending on the call volume and how much you were micro-managed. Individualism wasn't valued as much as falling in line with what management wanted and getting your numbers. Working with people of different backgrounds and networking with people in other areas of expertise was a positive benefit."
good,"At the end of the day, you can see progress in your day's work.  Every one in your department is like family,  "
good,It's been years since working there. The company can have significantly changed since then. I do not have enough recent information about the company to properly rate them.
good,"Good place to work, max pay is 22$ without a degree, benifits do not cover much, but they have 5000 a year in tuition reimbursement, and 2 weeks paid paternity leave"
good,"Very high pace job. It was an ok Job. My job involved constant travel, which got old real fast. It pays very well. And the health benefits were very good."

good,Northrop Grumman is a great place to work.. I am looking to enhance my professional background with a influential organization. A typical day is supporting two very busy directors with calendar management.
good,"Northrop Grumman's culture is very position. As a big organization, it has developed a very positive outlook and always tries to do the right things.  Like all big companies, it also lacks flexibility and depends on the managers, it can mean very different rules."
good,I worked as a contractor for a Researcher at Northrop Grumman. It was expected that I figure out the needs and the way to operate and program several pieces of equipment. I had to self-train on AutoCad and learn how to use a 3-D printer.
good,Conducted Technical Support when in town.  There was quite a bit of travel where installation and training was performed.  This travel was to most states and some international travel as well.
good,My experience at NG was both satisfying and enriching. I learned new Job Technologies as well as new ways to identify problems and solve problems using these new technologies.
good,I just contracted so not much to say. I worked there for 3 months before finding a full-time job somewhere else. They would have continued to employed me but I wanted benefits.
good,Would work there again.  The environment was very challenging yet very enjoyable.  The people i worked with were very well educated on all things related to the job.
good,Great place to work for was able to work both on HVAC and Electrical. Was part of bidding and selecting of contractors for projects. Also  involved in scheduling of project as not to interrupt production. learned  about air compressors and dryers.
good,The benefits are good and the work is great. I had great managers that were willing to help when needed. For the most part it is a great place to work if you are confident in who you are.
good,"This was a great job , with great benefits.  The only problem was the culture. There was a lot of harassment from other employees on a regular bases. ..other than that ...great job."
good,"Northrop is good company to work, the most enjoyable part of the job. The management is clear. Team works is very understandable. Peoples are friendly."
good,"It is a bit of an adjustment working in a secure environment. Really exciting work if you get on a good project. The nature of the work kept me motivated to work hard for the short time I was there and probably would have kept me working hard for some time. That being said, we were in a windowless secured area. Try and get your clearance before you get there, otherwise you will need your hand held everywhere you go until it clears."
good,Great company to work for.  They have great benefits and a competitive salary. They are all about team work and promoting from within.  Definitely recommend this company.
good,NG was and is a great place for those that want to make an impact.  It allows you the opportunity to interact with senior management.  As everything else though you make your opportunities.  However you will not be stopped  There is also a culture of increased responsibility and a lot of movement for younger personnel.
good,"Northrop Grumman Isn't a bad place to work at all.  They were currently Orbital ATK until they were bought out. The one thing I think would be helpful to the company is to hold there employees more accountable for their over all performance.  IE attendance, workmanship.  Other than that every Superior I worked under was extremely helpful and I felt they really wanted to see me succeed."
good,I've enjoyed working for Northrop. The tasks have been challenging and work has been rewarding. The flexibility to work remotely greatly helps. Most management is supportive and uplifting. The hardest part of the job is having to work multiple projects concurrently. The most enjoyable is the level of responsibility placed on you.
good,"you were looked after and it was easy to do your job and move up in the company if you took advantage of the education program, still some politics involved but at least your degree can be paid for to a certain degree as long as you stayed with the company."
good,It was a good place to work and would consider working for company again. It was long hours and mission was important. Middle management could have used some fine tuning but over all good.

good,Was able to learn skills to move up to a key worker..family oriented employee appreciation for jobs well done.enjoyed time working there would be willing to return if needed...

good,"good experience, nice people, great benefits, good retirement  why do I have to fill this out don't have anything else to say. Would still be working there but was layed off"
good,Worked at many various facilities helping different organizations with inventory issues. Worked as contractor in government sites as well as at Northrop facilities. Worked 5:30-2:00. Different cultures at each facility.
good,"I'm still fairly new to the job, but so far I enjoy it.  The work has been fast-paced and challenging and I've learned a lot.  Like most engineering positions, it has been demanding and I have put in a lot of overtime - but I got paid for it, which is a plus.  The job is chaotic, but a healthy development program always is.  I've learned to prefer it over the years."
good,Calibrated a wide range of test equipment.  Performed health and safety audits.  Performed self-governance audits every three months to ensure compliance with the quality manual.
good,"I consider myself still new to the company and analyzing the environment. I'm still assessing so far, so good.  I love the ability to work remote!  Management has given me autonomy."
good,"While working on a large satellite program at Northrop, I found myself hating the job because it was boring, uneventful, and purely fueled off processes rather than novel design. The median age of the staff was between 45 and 55 which made cultural assimilation difficult for me as a young buck fresh out of school"
good,I started my career with Northrop Grumman and I was given everything that I needed to succeed.  I only left the company because my job relocated to the West Coast.
good,"All the managers I encountered on the job were professional and sensitive to employee needs.  Coworkers were supportive and helpful in the beginning, then less so later on."

good,"It was a productive place to work."
good,PEO-STRI/STRICOM is the development area for military simulations. You never know what you are going to work on from day to day and everyday brings a new challenge.
good,"While you have a great management organization, your work within this company can be fantastic. There are good benefits, a decent working environment, and they respect the different diversities within work, individual and personal styles. My only complaint would be that the opportunities for advancement and growth can be kneecapped when you are on a program with unhealthy levels of attrition. It is hard to get placed on other programs or to be respected for the services provided, some even outside of the job description, when consideration is made for promotion. While there are good and bad programs, the NGTS working sector is a relatively decent place to work."
good,"-Schedule interviews"
good,"As an employee of ACRO Service Corporation, I was responsible for providing desktop technical support to the NGIT Migration/Refresh Team as a PC Network Support Specialist for deploying desktop and laptop computers to the Electronics Systems Division of Northrop Grumman.  A typical day included picking up new computer equipment and delivering it to the customers office for installation. I learned how to deploy a computer on their network using their specifications for configuration. Management was very helpful in making sure that all of the computer equipment was prepared for deployment and handling any customer escalations.  The workplace was like a campus community with more than one building in the same general location. The hardest part of the job was going outside under difficult weather conditions.  The most enjoyable part of the job was every two weeks the team got together for lunch on Fridays."
good,management is great and there is a lot of room for growth within the company. The pay is also fair. Also has great benefits. It is hard work but everyone around you is working hard also .

good,"It was very stressful demanding and the boss was never there. typical in my field of work."
good,"Always have interesting things to work on here! Both engineering and program management listen well and pay attention to their engineers. While they focus on career and technical growth, salary growth doesn't tend to follow suite, so make sure you get hired at what you think you are worth!"
good,"Overall good company to work for. Lots of opportunities to transfer and explore other areas outside your area of expertise. Depending on the environment, the culture is overall less stressful than competitors"
good,Job security in a large company is a plus.  Pay in a government contracting  company not great.  Office environment and computer hardware not great either.

good,"Northrop is on the average, comparable to its peers (Lockheed Martin, Boeing, etc.) to work for, although it is going through growing pains as it struggles to integrate its diverse workforce into its culture. Work-life balance has been challenging, as there have been high-profile programs that demand extensive work."
good,"My time at Northrup was limited because i was there on a Temp Assignment through an employment agency.  I thoroughly enjoyed my time there. The work the company does is amazing and to be a part of that, even for the short time that I was there was wonderful."

good,I  had a good position with the company.  I was a subcontract manager and the Small Business administrator.  I was responsible for maintaining an approved procurement system and developing small businesses to do work on government contracts.
good,"I enjoy my job and the people I work with.  Once you establish a good reputation, more people will be willing to help you and invest their time in you.   The area is expensive and the surrounding lifestyle is overly busy."
good,"A typical day worked at Northrop was varied in scope.   The job consisted of insuring that the tools and processes that you were responsible for were working properly.   Also, there was new work which involved trying to improve the existing process so that the process could be made more efficient and perhaps less costly.  "
good,"This has been a good company to work for. Since I have started, I have had no complaints. I look forward to seeking advancement. This could be a forever home."

good,"I found that the culture was prejudice towards people who came from seemingly ""better"" backgrounds because it was perceived that they didn't struggle or work hard to achieve their position in life."
good,"Interesting technology"
good,"Enjoyed the working relationship with engineers and managers. Typical work day varied with the position. Originally hired to work in DC for the DDG-21 program. Held or attended 3-5 meetings a day until NGC got out of the program and sold its ship yards which was for the first 2 years of my time at NGC. Worked for a director and reported to Sykesville MD where I was performed program manager, engineer and leadership rolls as required. After a large program was canceled, moved to the international program until funding issues, then moved Linthicum, Maryland, until it was time for me to move on."
good,Northrop Defense Systems was a Excellent job during my time of employment.The job location was an inconvenience for my commute to and from my place of residence.
good,I began and built my engineering career with Northrop. I was able to move around to gain a solid depth and breadth of knowledge and experience. There are several opportunities to learn from a strong network of brilliant engineers.
good,You will work within a small crew that is specific to each trade in the yard. I learned how to work in a small team to achieve a common goal. My supervisor was a great leader. Management seemed to care about the employees. There was a sense of brotherhood between the workers there which made the job enjoyable.
good,I appreciate my boss and the opportunities I have been given.  There is no growth in Utah.  NG has excellent training offerings and employee resource groups.
good,Great place to work.  You always knew how your performance rated.  With increased education you could be promoted within the system.  Hour luch and great benefits
good,"The large contractor has a totally different vibe than the smaller groups. Not bad, but different. N-G tried very hard at times to make a personal connection but that proved very difficult. The best advantage I had at N-G was that I was given direction and left alone to accomplish my tasks. A lot of companies could learn from this example."
good,"CTMSP only started in 2016 and is still having some growing pains. However, despite and minor problems Northrop has hired good people and has set up sound management. Perhaps the only downside of working in this program is the lack of transparency by management. This is important because the relations between the company and the program can change direction rather suddenly. It's important for employees to have a better sense of what priorities are shifting and things that may be changing around them. "
good,I enjoyed working for Northrup Grumman. I was outsourced to this company from Verizon Business. The salary and benefits were very competitive with other companies
good,I Spent 31 continuous years there should be pretty self explanatory. I was always treated with respect and given every opportunity for advancement. Mentor ship is key at Northrop Grumman.
good,"Contractual work.... so chances of being there longer than a few years is minimal. Very relaxed atmosphere, the management is very flexible. Lots of potential with the company."
good,"Northrop Grumman is a great company to work for. Very nice culture, work ethic  and nice coworkers. Work schedule is plenty accommodating and management pretty understanding for the most part."
good,"Solid career start with to be expected hurdles of a government contractor. Very flexible work/life balance, good pay but can get boring or repetitive at times."
good,"good overall company with room for promotion. a lot of reorgs which makes things always changing. Good flexibility for work life balance, and good people."
good,Worked on a local project that was outsourced to NG. We were on a remote team and this was a limited project so not much exposure to the NG culture per say.
good,"Take phone calls from users and transfers from  analyst to help customers with installs of programs, hardware, and to resolve issues.Either by phone or emails."
good,"After roll call you were given your work assignment. Depending on what it entailed would determine the tools need for the job. You were  given either a Semi-annual, Annual or a Bi-annual service. With either service you are to inspect, diagnose and repair any default found on your assigned vehicle."
good,I spent my day writing scripts to test the software.  I attended meetings with the engineers to discuss testing.  I was left alone to get my work done which I appreciated.  The culture encourages growth and teamwork.  The most difficult part of the job was moving data in and out of the Top Secret environment.  I really enjoyed the people I worked with.  I left because it was too long of a drive to work (Aurora to Boulder)
good,"The layers of administrative, operational and program management are arduous.   Working with and working in the bureaucracy requires great patience.    Every project will take 12 months.   They have a good fair, well paying work environment, very people and family oriented."
good,Great company to work for. Plenty of opportunity to grow.  Excellent management to care for the people.  Lots of benefits in the company to assist employee's life balance.

good,Great place to work with forward leaning management. The benefits are the best I have ever seen and there is lots of opportunity for personal growth. The level of expertise is second to none.
good,The experience and people work with is what made me considered working for Northrop Grumman again. The working environment was heathy and productive because I got a chance to work with knowledgeable and good people.
good,"I enjoyed learning about the classified sector of today's military contractor firm.  The workplace culture is friendly and input is encouraged.  The hardest part of my job was ordering, coordinating, receiving and serving meals for in-house meetings as required."
good,"For nine years I worked as a Government Contractor with Homeland Security , Processing paperwork and coordinating fingerprints for new applicants . I worked with a team and gathered statistical data as well as communicated with applicants and directed them as needed ."
good,Company has substantial experience in technology and contracts. Contracts may be long in term and management is attentive to both the client and employee.
good,It was a very exciting fast paced environment that I worked in.  People we eager to jump in and give assistance where needed.  Learned and experienced a lot.
good,Treats you with respect and trusts that you have the knowledge you say you have and doesn't micro-manage you into the ground. The atmosphere is upbeat and encouraging so the days seemed to fly by with a sense of accomplishment.
good,"I was an intern during the summer for a quality assurance position."
good,"I have worked for Northrop for 7 years now and it has great job security.  Good 401K match, They take really good care of their Reserve/Guard military folks."
good,Good group of people and job environment. Staff were helpful and ideas were welcome for process improvement.  Great teamwork and support. Everyone was approachable.
good,"Productive work environment with exceptional benefits and pay scale.  Travel required to other facilities for meetings and to review equipment and processes, depending on the project."
good,Great group who care about their employees but need to stay competitive so they underpay staff.  Negotiate higher salary to start as merits and increases are small.
good,Loved my time there.  Wish I would have stayed longer. Work load and people there were respectful and very professional.  Pay is exceptional and among the top.
good,Must keep at even keel with management. Take advantage of any education stipends offered. Always look to advance as they tend to hire internally. Was hired through IT recruiter.
good,"Great support from managers,"
good,The location is a great place to work. The colleagues really mesh great. The management will work with you but they're not loyal. Definitely a career booster if you work for this company
good,Advancements are great if you get the right contract of fit one their other business roles. In the training environment the company puts it employees in a position to be successful.
good,"Correct implementation of safety proceedings while working in the building of frigates, destructors, airplane carriers, and cargo vessels for the United States Navy, as well asLNG cargo ships fornon-governmental customers."
good,"It's been some years (2006) since I worked for NG in Tempe, AZ but it was definitely a crucially important part of my professional growth.  The company has since been purchased by L3."
good,Great workplace environment. Everyone is helpful and collaborative. Learned a lot about engineering disciplines and processes as a two year intern there.
good,"If you are a young engineer, this company is a decent place to work. The benefits are comparable with other aerospace companies in the industry."
good,"Was surrounded by hard working, intelligent employees who genuinely cared about the mission. Those retiring from the military did not have to search far to find their ""2nd career""."
good,Great company to work for. I am only continuing to write due to this site forcing me to submit a survey in a world full of people shoving surveys down your throat.
good,"Good company to work for, global so you can go anywhere in the world if you are willing to travel."
good,"Great Company. It is the defense industry which means a highly competitive and fast paced environment. Defense contract work can, at times, feel a little volatile."
good,"I came to NGC because it tends to hire very committed people, that is to say, everyone is a hard worker.   Other enterprises I supported as a network engineer, have had staff who are lazy or incompetent.   NGC is a solid team all around.   The work life balance is good, however, the bureaucracy is often painful"
good,Everyday was a challenging stress free day with amazing co-workers You have good benefits and the work life balance is great for any situation. NGC is very flexable.
good,"I have nothing to add here. Northrop Grumman is a great place to work, great place to learn, great people. Management is stuffy and think they are above the people on the floor, usually low qualifications required, you need to know someone. Aircraft departments are edging out space due to contracts"
good,"Good atmosphere for very fast paced large scale proposals and proposal process.  Very interesting, challenging high tech environment.  Team effort and management supported the fast paced proposal atmosphere."
good,Love almost everything about it! Such a great atmosphere and the manager and coworkers are so helpful and friendly. The comradeship is like no other of anywhere I have ever worked and we all have a special place in our hearts for our military men and women.
good,"The only drawback at working for NG is that the work is dependent on winning/maintaining government contracts. If the contract ends and it's the only contract being worked, there's no place to go (especially in more remote areas) unless you're willing to relocate."
good,"I did thermal analyzes of electronic boxes, compartments, and printed circuit boards.  These analyzes were mostly static but there may have been some transient analyzes as well."
good,"The staff and coworker were friendly, helpful and encouraging. Although I was on a temporary assignment they made me feel and accepted me like a regular employee. My only complaint was that there was no opportunity for conversion to full time employed due to program closure."
good,Great company! Fast paced and always something new to challenge you. One of the top defense companies worldwide. Wish I could stay longer but moved to another state.
good,Great place to work and great management overall. Only drawback is that this industry's budget/sales is government driven so there is typically a lot of layoffs.
good,"Not a bad place to work."
good,"The team I was apart of helped me perform my daily functions, and I learned more about Microsoft SCCM, and writing software,Desktop and notebook directions to assist other team members to perform their daily functions so the could get home and me a family member or doing things that are fun."
good,"I have enjoyed working for Northrop Grumman the past 5 years. The company has excellent benefits options, education disbursement and flexible work arrangements to accommodate all kinds of situations. Annual pay increases are on par with the nation at 1-3% but holiday / end of year bonuses are reserved for those already making six figures (senior management)."
good,"People are really nice, work is slow but relaxed. Enjoyable part of job is talking with co workers. Management is varied and depends on your branch. Dailies and scrum is common"
good,"Great place to work, excellent benefits and flexible schedules provide work/life balance. Management cares about their employees and enables an open honest culture."
good,Good Company to work for overall.  Not a lot of opportunities for advancement in North Carolina. Pay was good and have good benefits. Company offered some opportunites for professional development.
good,"There are so many different types of positions at NG, that it is hard to say that I know what everyone's experience would be. I feel accepted, and for the most part work with good people. The work I did was not as mentally stimulating as I anticipated, but it had ups and downs. The benefits are very good, and the job security was unbeatable."
good,"No Review because I haven't worked there in 10 years."
good,"Worked very hard steady and always 8 hours to 9 hours a day, learned a lot and the company has exceptional benefits. The manager had Barbecues at lunch time and always let the team that they were doing a good job for our troops."
good,I can't provide much on Northrop other than they took good care of me. I work at a customer site with people from all different companies and don't interface with Northrop much.
good,"The B-2 Division no longer exists.  When I last looked at  GOOGLE earth the facility, in Pico Rivera had been turned into a shopping mall."
good,Worked on Long Island. Enjoyed the work and people. Was way better company than Honda Aircraft. I would avoid Honda at all cost. They do not care about anything but themselves
good,"Fabricated and assemble wiring per Engineer Instructions"
good,"Great company with great benefits giving you opportunities to develop yourself in practically unlimited professional areas."
good,I loved working at Northrop Grumman and I started as Field Tech/Logistician. This required me to travel across the US and this was very exciting. I then became Facility Coordinator which added more duties for me but I loved the variety in my daily task. The only reason I left was due to lack of contracts and they had to lay off most of the staff otherwise I would have stayed there until I retired.
good,Northrop Grumman was the best professional job I have had.  The people at the location I was at were top notch yet no one ever had any attitude like they were better or smarter than anyone else.  Everyone was there to get a job done and they were flexible when it came to the hours worked.  As long as the customer needs were being met then there were no worries.
good,The coworkers made the shipyard a great place to work. The labor force was second to none but management often led us to make correcting major changes and inspection programs were not inline with Naval Requirements.
good,The typical work day was ten to twelve hours.  It was a competitive but relaxed work place.  The opportunity for advancement was good.  The work environment was very good.
good,"Went to work, did my job on my own without supervision and always on time with my deliveries.  Good time celebrating employees birthdays and anniversaries with the Company every month and any other big announcements."

good,It is nice to come to work and focus on your projects and not get side tracked on other things.  Also the projects one has a chance to work on involved interesting problems and technology.
good,"In the commercial Line of Business, we were very cost competitive. This drives a very lean organization, where the management team fairly often wears multiple hats to meet the customer's (and prospective customers) timeline and expectations. "
good,Job sites and company culture are well managed. Everyone seems to make an effort to collaborate and show a spirit of sharing and caring about one another.
good,I worked for NGC for 33 years and had approximately 12 different assignments during my time with NGC.  It was  great place to work.  I worked on many interesting projects as SW CM person.  Good work and good people.
good,At Northrup Grumman I tested electronic RF communications equipment. I learned to use many different electronic testing equipment and procedures. The work place culture was positive and fun to work in. The hardest part of the job was extensive hours sitting and testing. The best part of the job was learning and testing many different components.
good,Northrop Grumman was a good place to work and being part of this large organization was knowing they are protecting our environment. I had great people to work with in our Contracts group. We all worked well as a team to meet proposal deadlines. I also interfaced with our many customers in meeting their needs on visits to our facility. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing I had excellent support from my Manager.
good,"Responsible to help work orders follow the path throughout the multi level building during manufacturing, while maintaining accurate records and working hand in hand with Engineers.  Worked in the warehouse to produce through initial kits and work orders all the special and governmental parts to go to the assemblers and engineers."
good,"It's a good place to work if you are interested in the aerospace  industry and have an active security clearance. If you don't have one, you're going to be waiting for quite a while before you can actually start doing some interesting work"
good,company actually cares about their employees and compensates accordingly good envirnoment to work at and very nice place to work in. great peopleto work with
good,"It would be too difficult to list all the skills experience I gained working here, so I will just say, a lot. I had many amazing experiences, which helped me when I did eventually move to other careers. I would definitely work here again."
good,"Great company to get associated with and get exposure to their environment, technology, group and ethics.I am very fortunate to get a chance to work with a great company."
good,"amazing place to be helping building ships for our country "
good,"A typical day was normal, not much excitement as a machine operator. You get the opportunity to learn many different machines. Management team was fairly helpful. The culture was somewhat fair. The hardest part of the job was staying on schedule and the most enjoyable part was running the machines."
good,I've been working for this company for 10 plus years and it has its ups and downs like any other company but at the end of the day it's been around for years and is at the for front in aerospace and defense. Again great place to work
good,"Industry leader in many categories.  Great salary and benefits.  Senior leadership pushes contract/program performance over work life balance - so plan on working many late hours, weekends, holidays."

good,Great opportunities to learn pursue career growth. Company has multiple ways to participate in career development paths to achieve professional goals.
good,Great place to work. Company supported all training that was needed for the job. Would have stayed longer but ad a chance to work overseas for a load more money
good,This was a place of challenges that would allow you to grow or fail. I found it to be a place of groups and clicks very unprofessional Directors and Sr. Managers. If they have a view of you they would
good,Overall a good company if you want to come to work get the job done. Do not have very much pressure and mico management is at minimum. I will work here again.
good,Northrop Grumman was a great place to start my professional career! I'd highly recommend to others as you get to learn a lot by working on different projects and meeting a lot of great people.
good,"Did not work here lond but I worked range control, one of the most laid back jobs I have ever had, enjoyed building targets , watching the tank shoot. Wiring the targets,"
good,Have been working here for about a year and it's one great company to work for we are rated the number 1 aerospace company in the world. They received a new contract for the new long range bomber which I think is very cool.

good,Northrop Grumman is a truly mission and customer oriented place where employees are made to feel part of the purpose rather than just an employee.  Northrop Grumman's great brand and notoriety is well known - it's great to be part of a wonderful company heritage.
good,Fairly steady and fast paced employer. I learned how to lay-out and install electrical equipment using the Metric system. The hardest part of the job was the climbing ladders and stairs.
good,"No two days are the same, constant growth and change keeps you busy and motivated. Management is very much involved and care about their workers. Only difficult thing about this job, is the location."
good,I worked at Northrop Grumman a long time ago(2012) and was on a DoD project. It is a great company and some great managers are there too. I would recommend if you like govt sector.
good,Shifts start early and run late at times. Learned how to use hand tools and arcing. Very big company and you work alongside numerous different people each day. Not an easy job but the pay compensates for the work.
good,NGC provides a solid career for individuals looking for longevity. The program mix provides a  stable environment for career growth and advancement. The company future seems solid.
good,"Family owned is great, the people that run the company are excellent folks to work for, they are there for you."
good,I enjoy working with the interesting people I work with. The company has very interesting project to work on.  It is truly a world class company.  I highly endorse it.
good,"Good company to work for while in school, I worked here part time to get me through college.  A typical day started at 7am and ended around 3:30pm which allowed 30 minutes to write reports. There was occasional travel and we had work parties during the holiday time."
good,"A typical day at work would be checking for trouble tickets and assigning them to the members of my shift, or taking said tickets. I would interface would customers to ensure cyber security software was properly installed and operational."
good,"Northrop Grumman Space Technology, Redondo Beach, CA      "
good,"Conducting Training Courses as well as creating new courses, developing curricula, lesson, plans, and training materials for students. I typically created the training materials, conducted pilot programs with the other instructors and then would hand it off to the other instructors to take over the class which freed me up to start developing the next course.  I spent considerable time on the manufacturing floor collaborating with manufacturing management, process engineers, and assembly operators learning all of the processes and procedures to develop training plans."
good,"- Great place to work."
good,"The life of a HR Generalist / Recruiter is filled with opportunities and challenges. Every decision presents the opportunity to support and drive the company brand. As the HR Generalist, I deal with employee relations by implementing organizational laws and regulations. As the corporate recruiter, I have the honor of selecting the talent and character of potential employees that would carry the brand of the organization / company. The most exciting thing about the position of HR Generalist / Recruiter is when presented with challenges are keeping the company brand at the forefront of all decisions, popular or unpopular. I except both opportunities and challenges the are inherent with the position of HR Generalist / Recruiter."
good,"Great pay, Great company. You MUST be mature and know how to manage your time. They expect you to do your work and present the results every meeting so dont slack off. But its a pretty balanced 40 hour week which is nice"
good,Good company to learn and work on huge projects.  Very challenging at time but with rewards only in the form of achievements.  Salary was lower than market.
good,Wonderful company that offers great benefits as well as the opportunity for job promotion. Works side by side with military branches stateside as well as overseas.
good,Company is very big and has lots of employees. They also have top of the line and cutting edge technology that blew my mind.
good,Veey safe and experience co-workers environment with management support and imput. Alway professionals and helpful no guessing verification required on all projects with signoff
good,"Good company, great engineers and great opportunity to learn the ship building business. Work was stimulating and effort was rewarded."
good,"Northrop Grumman has a huge portfolio and many opportunities to work on different, challenging, and interesting things. It is a good, interesting job with decent benefits, but the compensation as a whole is lacking. Stay long enough and your pay will fall well behind the market rate. This must be the tradeoff for huge-corporation job security. Middle management is a mixed bag of old-timers who have their favorites and newer managers with good ideas and fresh perspectives. My engineering colleagues are some of the smartest people I've met and are generally easy to work with and care about the mission."
good,This was my first job after high school and I started out as an avionics bench mechanic. The company was great and the advancement opportunities served me well as I eventually became a Senior Planner for Industrial Engineering which put me on a path for more diverse future employment.  After 21 years I left the job when Northrop bought the company and moved off of Long Island.
good,"Working in the B-2 aircraft depot I tested and verified that all systems were functioning before flight. During build process, troubleshot systems that are not working. "
good,The company has good benefits overall.  I was present on a project that replaced the PM with someone barely out of school.  Lack of understanding of Client caused a loss of contract.
good,NGC has made a lot of progress under current leadership. Definitely heading in the right direction as far as sales and technology go. Very talented top management and overall a good place to work.
good,Family style working environment. Pride in making product by hand. Company rewords workers based on making company goals from month to month. Once you have been through all the polishing departments their isn't much left to learn
good,This company is a great place to work. It is a very professional environment with great people. Working for Northrop Grumman makes me proud because we are helping are armed forces and also our nation.
good,Great team mentality and a great life work balance. Involved with working on and using up to date state of the art monitoring and tools. Also responsible for architecting the environment
good,"Usually bust and fast pace. You learn everyday and teach others, co-workers. Hardest part is maintaining schedule. enjoyable part is delivering a quality product to the customer."
good,"Working at Northrup Grumman means that you have to hit the ground running.  Faced paced environment with hardworking employees.  Co-workers are dedicated, fun to be around and committed to the company.   Hardest part is having to change gears at a moments notice.  Management is understanding and fair when it comes to family issues.."
good,A typical day of work is fast paced. I must be very flexible as there are many different duties that need my attention. I have very little face to face supervision and must be able to work proficiently on my own to complete tasks.
good,Ability to work remotely and good work/life balance practices...SW/HW experience has been invaluable and provided a wealth of knowledge involving IT Asset Management.  I most enjoy my work to develop processes/work instruction.  The daily risk assessment and analysis has been a huge benefit in my ITAM development.
good,"No complaints, overall good company. Friendly, understanding management. Great work environment with possibilities of advancement. Great health benefits but dental and vision could use work."
good,I worked grave yard shift. A lot less stress and interruptions. A great bunch of guys to work with. there was nothing hard about the job. We worked 4 10s so had 3 day week end.
good,"Most of the company that I have ever dealt with is full of fantastic employees. However, after 13 years, it has gone down hill. Management isn't as good as it used to be. A lot of micromanaging at play and disruptive to workers. The company has downsized quite a bit since I started and some good talent was lost. This is especially true for the management. Also, the layoffs have caused those remaining workers a lot more work for little to no pay increase."
good,Great job for 8 1/2 years just wish the company had stayed here so I could have worked until retirement.  The only place to transfer was out of state.
good,"Really enjoy it here, unfortunately the only way to advance is to ""cool your jets"" and wait for time to pass. As a high performer, your efforts are acknowledged, but not in the way that matters (promotions, compensation). Fun work, great environment. The only piece of the puzzle that is missing is the recognizing performers."
good,Working for a customer on site through Northrop has it's challenges. There are times where I felt a bit neglected but the company is solid and great.
good,"Excellent challenging assignments, discipline specific tasks, great work atmosphere, motivation for hands-on Engineers."

good,Wonderful company to work for - benefits are great - always looking out to make sure you have everything you need to do your job.
good,"Typical day consisted of handling any issues that arose with the virtual infrastructure, email archival system and video recording servers. Demand on return to service from issue was imperative to be as short as possible due to legal ramifications.  Work from home using RDC or the portal is a plus on being able to handle problems after hours."
good,Northrop Grumman is among the top government contractor to work for. I would recommend employment with Northrop Grumman to any experience professional.
good,There were many opportunities for advancement.  I enjoyed my job and was made to feel appreciated whenever I did an excellent job or helped in problem solving.
good,Good company with solid local management.  Corporate management is a bit disconnected but has good intentions.   The staff is fully engaged despite the survey results.  This is part of the overall disconnect.  Folks locally know their job and work very well with their customers and coworkers
good,Great for advancement! Wonderful company to work for.  Takes care of it's employees. Would highly recommend working here.  Really cares about its employees.
good,I enjoyed working with the soldiers. Traveled a lot. Direct Management was great. Upper management didn't care about the employees. I was part of an excellent team.

good,I was able to get involved with supplier surveillance and was able to lead a team of younger engineers and share knowledge gained from my extensive work experience.

good,Great company and great place to work. Good corporate culture.
good,"Northrup Grumman was the first design position i recieved after graduating from Triangle Tech in Erie, PA. I had never worked for such a large company and at times it was hard to get used to. My team in the engineering dept E24 helped me gain the necessary knowlege to be efficient and organized. During my time there i helped design the stowage elevator systems for the aircraft carrier CVN78. Getting to walk down to the shipyard and see my work first hand was astounding. It really made me take pride in all the work i accomplished there. We used programs such as inventor, AutoCAD and Catia. Iventor is the program i used the most and became the most proficient in. I created 3D models and 2D drawings of hatches, doors, elevator platforms and guarding. I was responsible for EIR's (electronic inspection reports) and also other database software in which we would vault our drawings once completed. I learned many aspects of ship building that i never thought possible."

good,Really enjoy working at NG. They have good people and the work is way interesting.
good,"Great coworkers, good management. I have learned a lot about the defense industry in my time here. In my particular job, it can be difficult to keep busy. I don't care for the lulls, but some programs are just like that. The most enjoyable part is that I am often left to myself to study and build skills relevant to my position. My job isn't typical-- many others are often slammed with projects and proposals. The hardest part for me is staying sane-- I prefer to stay busy with meaningful tasks, not just sitting and reading until the next quick turnaround task."
good,I made set routes for electrical wires on the computer   I learned about ships and their inner dwellings.

good,Enjoyed working at Northrop Grumman and woudl still be working for them if they did not lose the contract
good,"Worked there 30 plus years loved it everyday."
good,"Read and answered emails from department folks, VP and various other departments.  I learned how to deal with all different levels of management and personalities.  I worked with all levels of employees for approximately 100+ Engineers.  Co-workers had many different personalities from those just beginning in the working environment and needed to be their ""go to"" person to Executive Level.  The hardest part of the job was when a co-worker left the department, whether for a promotion or transfer.  The most enjoyable part of the job was being the ""go to"" person, and knowing without you their job would be more difficult."
good,I have fun in my current role. The management is great at their job.

Our manager was easy to get along with and gave us flex hours (6 to 2 was my time slot and work from home on Friday). We were a small group of people working in a remote area with a lot of complainers in the group. As an artist we were given work from the tech writers and able to work on our own without supervision. I never felt like it was a stressful job... there was a little travel to NJ involved. Nothing hard about the job or routine. I have some really nice illustrations that I prepared and I thank the company for that opportunity.

good,"I enjoyed my duties and my coworkers at Northrop Grumman.  A typical day varied, but consisted of basic clerical duties, as well as visitor control - this was a secure office.  I learned Excel, and used a scanner for the first time.  The management was good as far as my job was concerned, but the head of our office was not given the training necessary, which ultimately led to the closing of the office.  I truly enjoyed all my co-workers in this office, it was a very fun and pleasant work environment.  The hardest part of the job was that there wasn't always enough to do to keep busy, and I like to keep busy.  The most enjoyable part of the job is harder to pinpoint - I really liked my co-workers, I enjoyed the type of work, and the variety."

good,I work four ten hour days but if we have testing on new equipment we will work on Fridays. I enjoy my co-works and my boss is most excellent. The hardest part of my job has to be deploying and leaving family behind.
good,Brilliant coworkers developing cutting-edge technology. Bureaucratic management is a bit of an inhibitor. Can't always brag about your work due to trade secret restrictions. 
good,Inspiring management team and employees focused on quality products and commitment to schedule.
good,"Enjoyed the work, it was challenging and satisfying. The managers worked with you to get the job done. The staff was excellent. The corporate offices were a bit out of touch with the workers at the program levels, focusing on the immediate bottom line rather than the big picture and growth opportunities for major programs."
good,The management are very knowledgeable and supports field employees. Every team members are engaged monthly to report all aspects of their contracts.

good,"I really enjoyed working here for 15 years. I would have still been here if it wasn't for getting laid off due to budget cuts. Co-workers were very friendly, so it was a joy coming in every day. I learned a lot of on-line training also that helped. It also helps when you have a great boss like I did."
good,My primary experience with this company has involved working off site. Technology made it possible to keep connected through various company websites as well as the human element when needed. The culture of Northrop Grumman is very professional and business driven. No company socials were without first an overview of how the Company was doing giving acalades to individuals going above and beyond. The government's money is well spent when they contract with Northrop because this organization truly does look for the brightest and the best while still taking care of the personal needs of their employess by providing great benefits and competative salaries.

I stepped into a unique position, considering I was able to work hand in hand with senior program managers in order to streamline, improve, and eventually perfect the process flow for the production of a microelectronic chip used in the building of satellites. This opportunity allowed me to work in both a team and individual environment. Working to meet company goals and deadlines was an everyday part of the job, making every decision crucial to the success of the program. This position has further refined and improved my skills in both meeting individual goals in a pressure environment, as well as working with others in order to complete and maintain the big picture."
good,Typical day at work is hectic and fast paced. Learned a lot about data migration and data centers. Management was great. Co workers were great. The hardest part of the job was putting in 60 hours a week. The most enjoyable part was the travel
good,NG is a great company to work for but the company was going in a direction that wasn't beneficial to my future.
good,It's another large defense contractor with great advancement.
good,The company have been experiencing flat growth in the last few years. There is considerable uncertainty over where the defense industry is headed in the near future.

good,"Revenue driven company, management alright, diversified company, challenging"
good,Northop Grumman was great to work for until they started down closing divisions. I turned off the lights.
good,A typical day at work in our squadron will quickly vary throughout the day because we are jointly working with the US Navy. We maintain six aircraft and the Navy is responsible for flying them. We deploy overseas and throughout the United States as we support the Navy's mission.
good,I enjoyed the working hours and pay. Teaches a great trade skill and a great chance to move up.

good,Diverse coworkers and job opportunities. Interesting work such as signal processing of foreign data and designing military vehicles. The hard part is maintaining a work-life balance.
good,"When I worked at Northrop Grumman, I worked with a great staff in the auditing department. I performed financial, operational, and compliance audits for the company and met some great people."
good,"Painting, cleaning, sanding, and moving. For an engineering internship it really didn't help with anything regarding engineering. However it gave me a greater appreciation for the jobs of people who work with the parts and how they are affected by the engineers"
good,Managed a team of 22 people in the technical inspection of Army tactical vehicles.
good,"NGC was my first first big job out of college. Although I was only under contract for about a year and a half, I learned a lot about professionalism and business ethics. I feel that I would not be the professional I am today without the my experience at Northrop."
good,Productive company enjoy working side by side with the rotational soldiers.
good,Northrop Grumman Shipbuilding was a wonderful company to work for. I learned to be confident in myself and my abilities. Management was very encouraging and positive. The most challenging part of the job was learning it. The most enjoyable was the atmosphere and coworkers.
good,Northrop Grumman has been a great place to work but I am moving from this area and need to seek a career in the Hampton Roads area
good,"Northrop Grumman is a good place to work, pay and benefits are good, there is a learning curve, but the opportunity is there to learn."
good,"Overall, Northrop Grumman is a good employer. The salary and benefits are competitive and they are sincere about having work-life balance.  Employee turnover seems to be reducing cutting into legacy work culture. Work with some fine people."
good,The company offers a broad range of work in defense contracting as well as in the commercial space sector.  Many opportunities to move around.  Benefits are typical for a company of this size.
good,"Came into the company and was a little intimidated by the vastness (both its size and scope of current projects), but was immediately put at ease by a great manager who understands your needs, and is clear in outlining your expectations."
good,"I've been with the company for several years now and I feel that I am part of a team. Politics seem to be minimal and the environment is positive. There are bad apples at every company and this is no different, but those are not very common with where I am at. I enjoy coming to work each day."
good,Great company to work for. They could pay better based on location but it's doable. I love working around the latest tech and some of the hardest working people.
good,"Great Company with an amazing educational program. My team members  treated each other as family. Growth within the company available, but may require relocation."
good,"In my 33 years with Northrop, my career has taken me from an N/C Programmer to Website Admin, Lead Standard Tool Designer and more.  A great place to work, where if you show incentive, take the lead on tasks, you will get noticed and promoted!"
good,Great company to work for. The company has a excellent benefits package. The pay is highly competitive. They employ quality personnel and treat employees very well.
good,I've been with the company for 11 years and I've had the opportunity to grow my knowledge and skills. I would highly recommend NGC for entry-level and professional level positions.
good,"I really like that I have various tasks throughout the day, as this pushes me toward positive growth and improvement upon skills and knowledge (not to mention, this makes for seemingly quick shifts). However, there is an overall culture of angst and hurry that comes from this collective consciousness of ""being behind"" in one goal or the next. Thankfully, my coworkers and managers are accommodating, helpful, and easy to work with. The benefits, pay, and hours are great as well, which shows how much Northrop Grumman does value its employees despite the sometimes heavy-laden demands of the day. Overall, this is a great company that offers any employee the opportunity to grow and advance in his/her career field, providing a path to grow in skill and pay."
good,"Management was always trying to grow productivity. There was a lot of relative autonomy. A great place to work, but there was not always a direct view of how your contributions aided the overall productivity of the projects."
good,Feels good working on programs of significant national security contribution with professional colleagues.    Excellent work life balance.  Friendly work environment.
good,"Overall Northrop is a great place to work.   The work is amazing!  You are making a difference for America!  VP and Leadership truly want us to be successful.   But, schedules are tight and way off from reality.  Whoever created the schedules, were way off and we all suffer.   With that said, work schedules are very flexible and we all support each other."
good,"Good company to work with.  Everything you'd expect from a major defense contractor."
good,"During my last fours years at NGC; Our work day typically started at 0700 hrs. and ended at 1600 hrs. I worked in a laboratory responsible for the testing and repair of equipment used by the USAF.  I met with management on a daily basis to discuss work priorities along with daily company briefings. At the end of the day we discussed repair and testing activities completed during the shift as well as lessons learned and plans for the following work day. The hardest part of the job was duplicating the environment in which the equipment was initially reported as failed (i.e. temperature, vibration, etc.). The most enjoyable part of the job was repairing equipment turned into the laboratory and returning it back as serviceable to our supply chain ASAP."
good,A day consists of an early start followed by productive events around the manufacture of products. This is probably central to most large companies throughout all industries.
good,"The environment is somewhat relaxed. They care about their employees and they have lots of fun company functions. The pay is ok, but they have almost unlimited volunteer overtime for those who really want to earn."
good,"I was given several opportunities for career growth and development within my position.  Management actively supports employees growth through coaching, job training, conferences, and providing employees to lead small efforts projects."
good,"Great foundation for any career, from internship to entry level, promotional opportunities and advancement. Great experiences and exposure to many different functions."
good,"I found Northrop to be a decent employer with flexible hours and good benefits, but I found many decisions made by management to be questionable and the channels between them and the employees could have been much improved."
good,"NG is a great company to work for, I really enjoyed it. They were very accepting and accommodating to adjust my schedule to my college schedule and they pay good."
good,"Northrop is a good place to work. Leadership is outstanding, leads by example.  A bit over the top on inclusive actions related to hiring and promotions, you really need to be over the top performer if you're not in a protected class in order to move up in the company.  Environment is good, transparent communications and people are friendly and very smart."
good,"Job security is not as good, but I was here for over 15 years. i moved around in positions but never a title change and increased work, and so no promotions really"
good,"Your Manager dictated how you were utilized and often treated.  "
good,I thoroughly enjoyed my time here. A knowledge rich atmosphere with much to learn. State of the art electronics and above average compensation. I would definitely recommend it to anyone.
good,"NGC offers a good work/life balance with either a 9/80 schedule or a a weekly work from home day. Management is supportive and the compensation/benefits are great. However, there is very little room for growth."
good,I got opportunities to interact with many levels of associates at Northrup Grumman. I supervised production supervisors and engineers. I trained and interacted with both supervisors and production operators. I interacted with upper management and support associates in maintenance and research departments.
good,"Good to dive right in and learn a lot about the career of IT. "
good,It's a pleasure to work in the Dynamics department. The team is great as a whole. I have been able to grow from Mechanical Laboratory Analyst to a Dynamics Test Conductor.
good,I had a great experience working here. The management is competent and it seems like they would like to make it a great place to work. You have ample opportunity to learn a lot in the work place.
good,Thoroughly enjoyed my time with NG.  It was fast paced and there was always something new happening.  The Melbourne operation was/is expanding continually and offers many opportunities for growth and development.
good,"Northrop provides a good working environment and support for what needs to be done. They encourage openness and innovation. They provide support through periodic recognition through lunches, after hour activities, and opportunities for charitable work."
good,"Northrop Grumman was a great company to work for. They compensate you fairly, have great financial benefits (401k, etc.), and decent health/PTO benefits."
good,The company offered very good pay and benefits.  They also provided tuition reimbursement as long as the degree plan was career field related.  I would recommend working for Northrop Grumman.
good,"Wonderful experience with great leadership, a truly ethical company. The only negative is that the compensation is way below average for the industry."
good,"Working at Northrup is a very good experience.  All of the people are very friendly and are willing to help when needed.  Scheduled work hours are a 9-80 schedule so every other Friday is an off day.  There is a very large area of expertise at Northrup and the job is always more than what expected in scope.  Time limits are strictly enforced.  Programs do not last forever and each employee is expected to find another project before the current one is over in order to stay employed.  "
good,"As a big company they offer good benefits, but you can also get lost in the numbers.  Every program is run differently.  Some have a layed back working environment, While the one next door can be really structured."
good,"I had learned how to prioritize my workload and manage my crew during my work shift, how to help my mechanics trouble shoot and repair vehicles so they were ready for the next Rotation coming in to train."
good,My time at NG was great. Overall the pay was good until certain contract requirements caused the pay to be cut across the board. Other than the pay cut we took which wasn't actually Northrops fault everything else was great. I enjoyed my time working with them. Maybe someday I can work for them again.
good,Northrop Grumman is a diverse company that offers many perks including upward mobility to their employees.  The classes offered at the DAU university is a big incentive for me to continue to learn my craft.  The continuous training  is encourage by Northrop Grumman.
good,"NG is a fun and interesting place to work. While not stressful, you are expected to know your job inside and out. Often, you're required to make decisions that your direct manager may not know about in detail. This means you have to be a duty expert on a daily basis. There is room for growth. Like most businesses that deal with the government, there is plenty of process and red tape to slow progress on nearly every task."
good,"I was a contractor through Northrop Grumman so some communications were delayed as a result there of.  Management encouraged work/family balance, encouraged continuing education and volunteering."
good,Great place to work with terrific benefits! Lunch provided once a month during a meeting for all staff to go over how the company is doing. They always keep you in the loop of how the company is doing overall.
good,"Worked as third party computer repair on mainframe computer systems, Data General and DEC. Typical day involved going to customer sites to provide support for computer system failures."
good,Fantastic company with a focus on ensuring employee happiness.  Outstanding Benefits and focus on delivering best value to customers.  I recommend this company to anyone.
good,"I worked in a small environment, with a small group of workers.  But the time spent with the company and former co-workers made it a fun and pretty laid back work place."
good,"Northrop Grumman overall job performance for all government contracts is superior."
good,"The position was rewarding and allows for the development of various technical and management skills.  The environment allows for interaction with various entities outside of the organization, i.e. other developers and contractors and government representatives."
good,Good company that is people oriented and has excellent benefits.  The management allows the employees to recommend change and perform their daily tasks without micro management.  Due to the system that I worked on and being one deep at my positions I had to work extra hours pas my 40 hours to ensure customer requirements were met.
good,I personally had no problems working at Northrop. When there was a problem with my clearance my manager and security person worked not stop to resolve the problem.  Great work environment and benefits.
good,There is a lot of history with this company. They are hiring more young engineers to replace those on their way out. Great start but lots of red tape.
good,Learned all aspects of engineering in order accomplish automation support for all departments.  Management was fully supportive with both training and personnel.
good,When you are hired into the company you are immediately given tasks that are done by professionals that have been there for years and you are expected to learn a quick pace. Once you are comfortable with your workload it gets pretty steady afterwards. The most enjoyable part is the visibility to management. There are many opportunities to be seen and recognized for your work. Hardest part is just starting out because the onboarding and training process can be a bit hectic.
good,"I was a contract worker there so I did not receive benefits, but it is a very good place to work."
good,Learned a lot over my 17 years with NG. Always using the latest equipment and technologies.I have enjoyed managing my teams and making sure they are successful.
good,The company values their employees and provides great benefits. The culture inspires creativity and include flexible work schedules.  The workplace promotes teamwork with a mission driven focus.
good,Northrop Grumman was a good learning experience working on the F/18 tank no.2 with good people and working in the sealing department. I enjoying learning and watching how the veterans did things
good,"A typical work day consisted of identifying skilled personnel to fill positions as full time Northrup Grumman (NG) employees and Government Contractors. The position was intense and extremely stressed based upon the hiring turn-around time. My management was located in Halls Church, VA and I on the west cost, leaving the daily operations to me in the management of a remote office and more than thirty employees. What was learned centered itself on taking care of NG's customer without unneeded support from corporate headquarters for mission accomplishment."
good,Northrop Grumman is excellent at data security and in engineering solid solutions for its customers. I look forward to seeing other opportunities for NG in Arkansas.
good,Flexible schedule and varying job duties. Friendly team-oriented work environment.  Government contracts require specific terminology in requirements documents. Many positions require a security clearance.
good,"I had opportunities over opportunities to learn, and challenge myself. When working on programs it could get very stressful. A good Program Manager could keep the stress level low and acknowledge your hard work. Other Program Managers did not care and drove staff too hard."
good,"Poor compensation for good work, but a good place to initially develop skills early on in your career. Work is interesting and the people are good. Work life balance is amazing."
good,"The nature of the industry makes some weeks slow while others require lots of extra time and effort to meet company goals, and these weeks make for the most difficult part of the job. The management is mostly hands-off but does a good job keeping an eye on the progress of all projects."
good,"Great company, but limited opportunity to move around to different programs. Tough to get offer from one unit to another unit. Example: An employee trying to cross over from IS to ES&CSO even when all requirements are met."
good,"Very much enjoy the company and people, however I am not happy in my current position. Management is usually intelligent, sometimes old government habits are hard to deal with."
good,"Productive and fun workplace, good management team, typical day could start off very fast and sometime stressful, but at the of the day, the big reward is job well done."
good,Excellent company to work for. I learned a ton from my peers. Plenty of rotational projects you can go to if you find the right manager. A lot of opportunity to grow skills out of college. Hard to be able to move to higher positions without leaving the company and coming back in.

good,"I learned a lot while working with Northrop Grumman. They are very productive and the job atmosphere was a plus. The teamwork was amazing. The manager I worked under was an awesome manager. She showed a lot of concern for her employees and made sure that any questions that you asked were answered.  I didn't really have a day were there was a hardest part of the job because the help, if needed was there at all times. The most enjoyable was the four team members that I worked closely with."

good,Please fix your IT department. Remote management is not the way to go. Other than that I hear that the rest of the departments are great to work for.
good,"This is a great company to work for, only thing is of course the defense contracting world is prone to layoffs. Otherwise I have nothing but good things to say."

good,Working for this company I learned to better communicate with all levels of management and became more organized.
good,"The Northrop Grumman Woodland Hills facility is a great place to work. There are a number of educational opportunity programs for growth and management and co-workers provide a relaxed environment. On the negative side, the management structure has been under constant revision over the past few years to meet the needs of the marketplace. This, however, can be very frustrating especially since the accessibility of the organizational structure is neither convenient nor updated regularly."
good,"I was a consultant at NGC, I cannot possibly discuss anything which is related to being an actual employee, since I do not know anything."
good,"a typical day at work"
good,"Until Huntington Ingalls split off from them.  A lot of people were laid off, and I figured it was time for me to go back to school"

good,"Good place to work, productive environment, and great coworkers."
good,Able to work from home. Great management and support team. Room for growth but I would have had to relocate.
good,worked there for 18 yrs and liked working there. the work was interesting and chanlging. I love the work i did and was a hard worker never late always on time. but had to quite because home was forclosing had to move to colorado to live with relitives. and now resently moved back to salt lake city utah.
good,Each day we would want on trucks to come in with parts download the trucks and store the parts. Being that is was a warehouse and there was only two of us there I learn alot of the different types of paperwork we had to do the different reports we had to do and was always on the confrence calls. Our management team was up in New York so we did not see them that offen but they always support us on anything that we had going on. The hardest part of the job for me was when the company move the warehouse to FL. I enjoyed the job because you was really your on boss and as long as the job got done there was no negative feed back at the end of the day.
good,Great place to work. They appreciate the employees and assist with career growth.
good,"One of the best jobs I have ever had, I thought I was taking a job that would get me more advancement but I regret leaving this company."
good,"WIth enough variety to stimulate and encourage growth and development, Northrop Grumman is a comfortable extension to one's home life. The company, while very large and diversified, is also capable of meeting the demands of the employee at the individual level through good personnel management and benefits."
good,"Working with TASC was one of the best experiences I have had. work was fun, relaxed, but challenging. HR was responsive and always available for any questions. Management provided clear direction for expectations of employees. Advancement was always encouraged."
good,"I worked for NGC before it cut back its employee total from 125,000 to 75,000 so my knowledge is a bit dated. However, I was part of a corporate team tasked with rolling out a very interesting, forward-leaning project across the entire organization. I had many opportunities to get involved with cutting-edge employees engaged in creating and implementing three interrelated projects. A very enjoyable experience. I wore four job titles simultaneously, and had little time to worry about which one best described my work."
good,I was on a contract with Northrop Grumman and while I was here I was treated very well. The employees were great to work with and I learned a great deal.
good,"Super benefits package, friendly people all the way up the chain. Everybody's helpful. Clean, climate controlled, top notch test equipment. Well documented products, quality really is job one!

good,NG is a great place to work.   They push you to excel in all aspects of your duties.  You will be exposed to many additional tasks that allow you to grow as a person and as a professional.
good,"Overall, Northrop Grumman is your average defense contractor with a similar work culture you'll find at Lockheed, Raytheon, and all others. Besides the high-end tech, what really stood out to me were the makerspaces (AKA FabLab) provided by the company. These were spaces for employees to collaborate and build anything they'd like. Northrop provided all sorts of tools and equipment and was constantly adding more stuff just so employees can continue to experiment and express their creative selves."
good,My review at working for Northrop-Grumman is that it’s a great place to work. However I think that it could be a little more diverse and everyone doesn’t have to be just coming out of college.
good,"Overall, I was very satisfied with the work I was able to do at Northrop Grumman. I was able to move between multiple teams and contribute in fulfilling ways. The largest drawback would be the red tape, and if you're not proactive then you'll have nothing to do. My advice: ask for work if you want to work."
good,"The culture was great, fast pace, competitive and fun! I really enjoyed having the opportunity to add value to programs and manage a competent team; that had a lot of success."
good,"Northrop Grumman is a very large corporation with plenty of interesting programs to work within. I found that the 9/80 work week allowed for a very flexible work-life balance, with every other Friday off. Since it is large corporation, they make sure to compensate their employees well."
good,Beat company I’ve worked for!  Give you plenty of time for training. The co workers were the only downside to it. They were too intimidated and wouldn’t help you at all. They’d turn their back while watching you struggle. They like to start rumors like we were in High School.
good,Northrop Grumman is a great company to work for. The only problem I faced was not having promotion opportunities because of my position. As the building chief engineer. unfortunately there were not any opportunities for me to grow.
good,"Plenty of opportunity to grow your career and advance."
good,I like the people on my team.  We all work together and strive to get the job done.  The work culture is pretty fun.  The hardest part of the job is time management.  I am on 10 different portfolio and sometimes time can slip away.  I enjoy the flexibility and there is no micromanagement.
good,They really love their people and take care of them. The benefits are amazing and the culture is very inclusive. They offer a lot to their employees and ways to expand your career in many different paths.

good,"flexible work days and hours."
good,"Supply Chain folks are assigned to manage materials in a decentralized manner.  It's a large company with lots of opportunity to move around depending on your ambition.  It can be bureaucratic, and also like a family-style environment where you work with a cross-section of multi-disciplined people everyday.  The company follows a 9/80 work schedule, where you work 80 hours in 9 days and have every other Friday off, very popular.  Good pay, and benefits."
good,Northrop has opened my eyes to many different opportunities not only in life but in work life as well. Gives a lot of knowledge and has great chances for advancement and promotions. People are great for the most part and managers are very easy to work with.
good,"Pretty typical large aerospace corporation. Great name/brand recognition, working on world class projects. Pay is average compared to the industry, and pay raises average. Management is hit or miss depending on who you get. Hardest part of the job is switching schedules depending on the work load, for example, 6 months of light work followed by 6 months of overtime - but at least overtime is paid."
good,A good company and positive experience. Over eight years and always a good experience. I would recommend Northrop Grumman to others. Good pay for the work you do.
good,Management was excellent and the contract was fine.  I worked 12 hour shifts.  The Northrop Grumman team worked well together and professional mentoring was freely available.
good,"Was a federal contractor (CDC) through NG. Some companies don't care at all about their contractors, but NG really made sure we felt we worked there, not just at our contracted office."
good,"Depending on your job functions, your scope of your work consist of tasks involving aerospace duties."
good,Typical Day consisted of TTP of adversary along with U.S. Military capabilities. Working with a USMC Computer Simulation and various other simulation models. I learned how the USMC operated in various simulated war time environments. My Northrop Grumman Management was excellent and the culture was great. Travel to Okinawa in Commercial seats.

good,I have learned about this company up to the day they lost the contract with crane. Northrup Grumman was and excellent company to work for I enjoy all the time with them.

good,Learned all aspects of engineering in order accomplish automation support for all departments.  Management was fully supportive with both training and personnel
good,I spent along time at this company and was hoping to retire there unfortunately with a large company they don't always look out for there employees when unfortunate situations arise.
good,"No complaints about the company."
good,"Multiple opportunities for growth in different areas"
good,"A typical day at work is usually busy.  There is always things to do.  I have learned how to use some tooling, see what is done with the cables from the time we pick the kits to sending the completed cable to the customer.  "
good,The majority of the people that you interface with are great to work with.  The company has hired many new College hires which makes the environment nice as many of the new hires are willing and eager to learn.  If working on a production program it can be difficult and at times stressful. You have 2 different reporting structures: functional and homeroom and at times the goals are not the same which causes many challenges.  The leadership team is constantly going through change which is also very challenging to an organization.
good,Northrop Grumman is a good company. In here you have a opportunity to get a lot of training and your skill will be improved . You will have a chance to learn some new technologies.
good,Receive and move parts to stockroom for production use. Call on suppliers to resolve paperwork errors for receipt of parts. Load and unload trucks. Help out with issue dealing with the stockroom.
good,"NGC is a company that surrounds themselves with pride, value in people, and workmanship.  The company is deeply concerned with their delivery of services."
good,Northrop Grumman is one of the best companies to work for when it comes to IT. Plenty of expansion and growth and always something new and exciting projects to work on.
good,Training different cultures through an interpreter. Rehearsals are very important. Management understands the difficulties but also have faith in you to get the job done. The host country appreciation your attempt in learning their culture. Distance from home port. Host country becoming independent.
good,The NG management has established the culture of balance.  Balance between getting the job done and flexibility to take care of your personal affairs when needed.
good,"Daily Task consist of obtaining material as well as managing all supplier-related activities associated with the supply chain. Developing requests for quotations and proposals, analyzing supplier responses, participating in negotiations and subcontract awards, maintaining subcontracts, and managing the relationship between the company and suppliers. Work closely with other other team members, as well as with internal customers to understand, integrate, and assure documentation requirements. Acts as an authorized agent of the company with the responsibility to commit company resources through contracts and agreements for the procurement of goods and services. Meets with suppliers and partners to discuss performance-related issues."
good,"I really did have a blast, and met some incredibly effective team members and managers. Competitive pay, great benefits. This was my first corporate job and they did not ruin it for me. There are a lot of opportunities for growth and transition, even if software is not your style. Their internal training programs are also fantastic and well worth the effort."
good,"Northrup Grumman is one of the few jobs left where you can have an entire career working for the same company. They do compensate their workers very well - good salary, excellent benefits package, continuous training, opportunities for employee input and bonuses on occasion. Having the shipyard as a reference on your resume is a very nice perk as well."
good,"Interesting  development allowed freedom to contribute to the immediate team."
good,NG is a a huge company that manages to make each person feel a sense belonging.  My only gripe with NG is that our management promise us other opportunities in the company before they won the contract.
good,While I worked at Northrop Grumman I had the opportunity to work under some great managers and mentors. This was the primary reason I stayed with them for 20 years before moving on. Though a large company it had a warm family atmosphere along with their annual family picnic.
good,"Northrop Grumman offered a diverse work environment and encouraged employees to further their work skills or profession through their Continued Education program.  I learned taking advantage of this benefit was used frequently and strengthened the company's workforce knowledge.  Northrop Grumman and most of its managerial staff supported a healthy work life balance for their employees with ""Employee Appreciation' days, which produced a longer tenure for most.  "
good,Worked with some very nice people. Loved the culture and perks of the job such as the delicious cafeteria food. Very nice and well maintained environment.
good,"Company as a whole is great to work for just not the one in Huntsville, AL. The  computer software used to conduct the test on the Missile Systems and its components was very antiquated, still using older version of windows 98. Firm ware and hard ware have advanced beyond the version being used and made it quite difficult to repair faults encountered, due to the lack of hardware resources."
good,"My day starts at 7:30a by choice to avoid traffic."
good,Great company to work for and they really focus on home life. Great benefits and there is always room for job advancement.
good,"I really enjoy working for Northrup Grumman. Great work environment, everyday I learn something new. This company aides you in the learning process, they ensure that you understand the training information before you go out and teach Customers."
good,"I came to Avondale after recieving my BS in Mechanical Engineering and was thrown in to the job from the very beginning, I was give my own systems and equipment and these were increased periodically. There were many experienced engineers to question when I got stuck on a particular problem and all of my work was checked, so it was a good atmosphere to learn in."
good,"This has been a unique experience, as I have worked at the USMC and Aerospace divisions - with and without direct supervision.  I have been pushed to my limits - and maybe beyond on occasion.  This company is definitely for someone who does not want to ""rest on their laurels"".  There will be new challenges every day - and new expectations to fill (sometimes with no one having gone before you to show the way).  It is exciting and challenging, stressful and frightening - but ultimately, I believe, worth it.  The pay and benefits are competitive, but the review/bonus system needs some help - I understand that is a work in progress.  There are some of the greatest scientific/mathematical/engineering geniuses at work here at Northrop.  It is sometimes difficult to get out of meetings, and get to work, which can be frustrating."
good,Immediate management was great but senior management in the organization need to wake up and realize that the people are the ones making the money.
good,Very secure job that puts a lot of money and time in operation maintenance and PM's. Good working conditions and the proper tools to do the job.
good,"Great food and customer service. Liked the managers and  supervisors and coworkers Great selection of options on the menu. 3 cafeterias, hot grill , sandwich line , salad bar and daily hot soup and hot breakfast ( oatmeal and grits),liked free breakfast and lunch. early shift had time to spend with family, Good benefits. No weekends"
good,"great company to work, originally was TRW but was purchased by Northrop Grumman."
good,this was an excellent place to work before the sequestered period of the government
good,"A typical day would be to first check any error messages from the Oracle and SQL Server databases.  Respond to any messages from our team.  Continue work on the Health Care Data Dictionary programs for our team that we were building utilizing VB.NET for front end and SQL Server and Oracle for back end. Spent some time utilizing ETL in order to standardize and consolidate all records from differing data sources.  Ran any reports my boss needed that day.  Would frequently assist other departments if they were short - Oracle DBA's and system engineers usually.  I learned more about ETL and SSIS.  Learned about upgrading whole systems.  Learned more about Oracle , VB.NET, SQL Server and converting DTS packages to SSIS packages.  Learned about maintaining different database systems.  Had good relationships with management and co-workers.  Hardest part of the job was figuring out everything on my own and we were not allowed to go to training.  Most enjoyable part of the job was figuring out everything on my own as I do like a challenge!  Helping out my co-workers (most of the team was not too technical) was very enjoyable for me also as I really liked teaching them and seeing them benefit from what I could help them with."
good,Really liked the company and liked the benefits and they gave you the benefit of the doubt.  You had good management and they were open to letting you discuss things.
good,Tons of rewarding and challenging careers working alongside some of the best and most interesting people.
good,"As a Field Engineer and Training Analyst at Northrop Grumman, the normal day consisted of training either Active Duty/National Guard soldiers, or Department of State employees on a highly complex Sense, Warn and engagement platform. They were taught how to set up various networks (Secure and Unsecured), whether they be wired or wireless from  Motorola hardware. This system would provide 360 coverage on a Forward Operating Base (FOB) within a hostile environment mainly for early warning purposes. When training was not occurring, I either worked on Quality Control and Assurance in regards to our training material or troubleshooting something in the lab. Process improvement was an ongoing mission within the job.  "
good,Nothing bad to say about Northrop Grumman. Very fun environment in the Naval shipyard. I am ex military so I loved working with the military as a civilian
good,Northrop Grumman gives you the tools to be successful. I have loved every project manager I ever worked for. They are all for retaining employees even if it means allowing you to join another contract.
good,I really enjoyed my time as a Site Supervisor in Afghanistan. It gave me the opportunity to meet some great people and learn a lot about managing a team and dealing with high ranking military personnel on a daily basis.
good,I really enjoyed working for this company.  I felt a sense of accomplishment at the end of every workday.
good,"Great place to work.  Excellent management. Although, in this past year NG has made some changes and has fallen off in the ""employee recognition"" programs, as of lately the company has made a serious effort to give back to the staff by hosting functions to show appreciation for all the hard work."
good,"- Typical workday is pretty productive, you come in on your own time and start working on items that need to get done a certain projects."
good,Norhtrop Grumman is a company who does what they say. Their high performance culture and engaged workforce have produced high quality products key to our nation's defense. I am proud to work for this company.
good,"During my first research assistantship at Northrop Grumman Center for High Performance Computing, Mississippi E-Center, I developed visualizing Software using Linux and helped researchers in debugging program files. I created software using manuals and layouts for facility usage. I also helped researchers in visualizing flowing Mesh using Ensight10.0 software. Working with such an advanced team and up-to-date projects, gave me the chance to apply my gathered bookish knowledge into real life problems and gave the motivation to be a part of such great research group in my near future. I also discovered leadership skills as well as the way to deal with different members of my team and frequently assisted colleagues who had little or no background in computers."
good,I love the flex time...it really helps out with doctors appt.
good,"""Stretch"" assignments planned/designed to broaden an individual's skill set is strongly encouraged/fostered at Northrop. The daily interaction with Lockheed Martin personnel (in the role of Prome Contractor)has also been very rewarding and educational."
good,"although I still work for the same company, we changed names from Northrop Grumman to Huntington Ingalls back in 2011."
good,"Great to be in an environment that's cutting edge. Isn't that enough said? It's a defense contractor, can't say much more..."
good,"Although the conditions at the various locations can vary greatly, this is a great company to work for. Most of the employees will tell you that they're proud to work for the ""boy scout of the defense industry,"" and they're completely serious."
good,It was great expireance would still be there if the economy and government funding was not cut.
good,"I got to work with some great people. The company offers good benefits, a competitive salary, along with a generous amount of holiday time off."
good,"If you are interested in engineering, aerospace, or defense, or you’re just getting started with your career, this is a great company to learn what you love to do. There’s room to grow, however there’s plenty of bureaucracy; it comes with the territory. Northrop Grumman is doing a lot of cool things. Most jobs here are not on the forefront of technology and you will probably feel like a cog in a machine."
good,"Northrop Grumman has provided a stable and positive environment in which to work, grow, and develop my skills as a technical writer and process analyst."
good,"Northrop has provided an inviting work environment with flexible schedule, great benefits, and a supportive management team. I was provided the training and tools to do my job effectively along with the opportunity to train and grow."
good,"Love the people and the work we do at this company.  Typical work day and hours.  9/80 schedule, every other Friday off.  Great compensation and work life balance in most programs."
good,Despite it's business and corporate aesthetic. The company was really good to its employees and the workers were very friendly and professional. It was a drama free environment. Since being a contractor it was a bit difficult to maintain projects if proposed projects didn't pull through. To counter act that learning new skills and enhancing them everyday would help to adjust the risks of job security. Excellent but private projects to work on.
good,"there was no typical day at work. some days were really busy, some days not. I learned  attention to detail - there were a lot of very similar part numbers to deal with. the management were always friendly. it's a somewhat relaxed workplace culture there - they just want you to get the job done right. the hardest part of my job was having to multi-task - I had a job that put me in contact with many people through-out the day, and they all needed me to get with them in a timely manner. the most enjoyable part was knowing I was really helping people get their job done."
good,"Great work/life balance"
good,"I only left because another company hired me for HR, which is what I went to college for, to grow beyond just ""admin assistant"". I don't love Northrop Grumman because of the company.. it was my direct manager that made all the difference. I miss working for him. "
good,"It was a great experience to work here. I learned a lot and worked a lot with javascript and python. The mentors were very willing to help me learn. I was on a team with no other interns so it was mainly older people, so it was boring at times in terms of the social aspect. But overall a great opportunity and something that people really respect when they see it on my resume."
good,"It is like the other companies.  They all have their things they do to say they are looking after their employees, but none of them make it easy to get money for training or conferences even though they say they budget for it and want employees to go to it.  They also resist providing time to go to these things.  They want employees to get the most chargeable hours and that does not work with training and conferences that are during work hours."
good,A tyoical day working for Northrop Grumman would be a team efforts from all projects to deliver to client in a tinely manner with resilve and siccess for application implementations

good,"Fast paced work. Great leadership with defined goals. Expected to complete tasks on time, but flexibility given for unforeseen defect. Task related training is almost completely OJT, but more seasoned workers are ready to answer any questions."
good,"Smart People to work with.  Here I learned how to design applications that would work for groups of people of 10 or more.  The culture was government and very professional as this was for a contract with the CDC.  Of all the places I have worked, the management at the CDC were both relaxed and helpful to work with.  Northrop Grumman management were more distant.  A typical day involved working with customers, designing forms, and coding software."
good,"productive work environment, I don't work for Northrop Grumman anymore. they sold their share to Huntington Ingalls. some I can not answer these question. they where part of Newport news shipbuilding when I first started in the shipyard."
good,its a place to learn new things and grow with the company. I learned a lot on how to build a good product that I could be proud to say I help build to protect our country

good,The people who work at Northrop are great and kind. They always go out of there way to help however they can. They work well with everyone. I have nothing bad to say I couldn't ask for better.
good,The hours were nice both for first shift and second shift. Learned how to use some different types and older equipment and machines. Management takes good care of their employes. The hardest part for me was probably keeping my cool when preforming certain task with such delicate pieces.
good,At the location I worked people did not work overtime. However there was no small talk during the day and people generally walked fast to get where they were going.
good,Northrop Grumman is a fast paced company. It is a great place to start a career as one will have ground to learn. It is very competitive. The most enjoyable part of the job is one can easily balance family life and work. The managers are usually very understanding.

good,"Northrop Grumman continues to improve to be one of the top aircraft companies in the USA and takes pride in what they do everyday. The company is an all round experience in their field and has proven over and over that they can compete with the best of all the Aircraft Companies in this country that they can produce a quality Aircraft,"

good,the company had a very relaxed environment. performed research and development. excellent learning potential.
good,heavy radio repair welding soldering field fire and fuel depot maintenance
good,I did a little of everything while employed here.  I did installation drawings of conveyor systems.  Also did some shop drawings.  And some electrical schematics.

good,"My experience at the shipyard was a good one.  I learned so many valuable skills through out my 37 years of work.  Management was always willing to assist and mentor me, plus offer new and rewarding positions over the years.  My co-workers and employees were some of the finest people I have encountered in my life.  The hardest part of the job was ending a project and watching our hard work sail away.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the camaraderie between my counterparts, employees, and management."

Started as a systems integrator/systems administrator, became operations training lead, then the operations team lead and eventually the operations manager.  All team members were dedicated to the mission at hand.  Very high stress, intense and ever changing.

good,Exciting products and services. There are a number of experts that work at this company who continue to lead the industry with innovative thinking and world class deliverables.
good,"working at Northrop Grumman can be very stressful and can encompass long working days. They can be very flexible with the workday schedule. Unfortunately they do not offer sick or personal days, it's all PTO. When there is inclement weather they never close and the expectation to come to work is there."
good,"A typical day at work is busy and fast paced."
good,I enjoyed my time with Northrop Grumman and wish I could have stayed there for the entirety of my Career. But after two plant close-downs their was no where left for me to go.
good,A typical work day at northrop grumman was relaxed and stress free. Sure there were some days that were challenging but they did not out-weigh the good days. Management was always willing to work with their employees with whatever issue they may be having. The workplace culture was mostly nice open minded people.
good,the job is fast paced and enjoyable place to work. Management has problems identifying problems and solutions to help the mechanics do their jobs and to help the site.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job that I loved was working with the different cultures and personalities that I encountered. It was a very enjoyable expericence
good,"I don't want to gripe, but the position I was hired for had the description / requirements changed after I had been there two years.  If I wasn't suited for the job (in the first place), why was I hired?  I think perception(s) and expectations changed with the new management."
good,"Current contract has less than desirable management that is not indicative of Northrop Grumman. Having served for 14 years as Manager and employee, I am seeking outside employment solely based on poor management."
good,"I refreshed hardware for a government agency.  I enjoyed networking with everyone there and was given the opportunity to travel.  Management was OK, they did what they had to do.  Workplace culture was pretty good.  The hardest part of the job was working remote sites on a tight timetable.  The most enjoyable part of the job was contributing my strengths to the team."
good,"We had a good group of team members working on his project,"
good,"They really just look at the numbers and how they can cut things to make an extra buck, at least that is how it looks to me.  They could have stayed on my contract for another 2 months and transitioned to another company but they got greedy, from what I hear."
good,"CEO has publically stated his Number 1 goal is to promote LGBTs, females and people of color.  He wants to be #1 in Diversity Magazine's ranking for most diversified companies.  Heterosexual white guys don't stand a chance."
good,"This was a great company to work for but because their main client is the government, the company's vitality depends on government funding."
good,"The Security Management changed while I was on medical leave and this management decided to outsource jobs, mine being one of them."
good,A great company to work for. Good people to work with. I had many different jobs to do wish was good.
good,There are times where you feel that the company doesn't really care about you. It can be very demanding physically. There used to be a lot of room for advancement and growth but they have stopped that and now it is very difficult to go up in the company.
good,"Most of the leads know what there doing, most days it feels as if all they care about is how many job cards are closed and not as must as the quaity of work"
good,Very good culture. HR is very helpful. Could put more emphasis on training. Very secure work environment. Systems of records is user friendly. Recommend working there.
good,"Friendly work place, Flexible working hours."
good,It is a great place to work for the area and they have good benefits. I learned a lot about the aerospace industry and enjoy the work that I do there.
good,"There are a lot of organizational changes currently taking place.  As is often the case, there is a similar tension that comes with any change.  Policy changes are currently frequent, but will settle down as the organizational changes stabilize."
good,"Typically the day consisted of assembling parts of whatever job was currently ""hot"". Meaning that it needed to be ready for sale sooner rather than later. I was able to learn how to build certain mechanical and electrical cables that performed various functions, which I would not be able to learn elsewhere."
good,Unlimited growth opportunities. Ability to see the world and work with a diverse group of people. Training as well as tuition reimbursement to advance your career.

good,I worked for this company for a long time and never expected to be let go in the fashion they did a low level labor sweep and that was after they reclassified me to a level 2 from an 18 ???
good,Northrop Grumman is an excellent place to work. Ive worked my way up from a floor level technician to a Sr. Leadership position in the matter of 10 years. Upward mobility is open to anyone willing to put in the time and effort.
good,Hands down one of the best companies around to work for.  Only reason I am even considering leaving is my current management doesn't believe in career advancement.
good,Northrop Fire Department no longer exists. The fire protection services are contracted out. I worked with the company over 28 years ago. The whole structure has changed since I left.
good,"I'm proud to work here. The products created by this company are amazing. However, like any other corporate job with 11,000 local employees, hah, you can easily become just another number. It's not easy to advance in position here, there is a lot of competition and lots and lots of politics. "
good,"This company is generically like any contract company working in Iraq. The fact that one is in a war zone make the environment stressful. The compensation was great, but one pays for it by aging in almost athlete years. 12hrs per day, 7 days per week. But at the end of it is a mostly tax free, six figure salary."
good,Great place to work unless you have a racist supervisor who is jealous of your work ethic because it made his 20 yr veterans look bad. I would love the opportunity to work here again since it has been many years since I was termed
good,"Great company!"

good,"Inspection of the F/18 EFG model Structure Join Systems   "
good,I was able to learn a great deal about the field of Aerospace and its applications through the guidance of my coworkers and managers.
good,Northrop Grumman offers flexible work schedules and good benefits.  The work environment offers many training options for your current and future career advancements.  Recent changes in the economy had lead to workplace reductions in staff and other areas.
good,"A typical day at work: writing analyses to sell off requirements, close communication between the customer to insure all needs were met. This was by far the most enjoyable part of the job. The hardest part of the job was when other departments would not adhere to schedule deadlines which could create a domino effect and late deliveries. My co-workers were smart, kind and efficient. I learned how to deal with all types of personalities and was able to get along with everyone."
good,"how to build a submarine "
good,I enjoy my time work for Northrop Grumman and I would love to work for the again.
good,Was in charge of programs for the government.  Provided administrative support for 100 + personnel.
good,I have the opportunity to work in various different trades instituting department
good,"Company is awesome!  Pay 100% for school and raises are very good.  Unfortunately the plant I worked at has stupid, incompetent fools in management who ran the company into the ground..."
good,"Huge corporation...they want me to write more about the company, but as with any DoD company, we are currently walking on egg shells with the climate in Congress.  Wait and see."
good,"worked with Northrop Grumman many years go at Camp McKall, Fort Bragg, NC. Would be honored to be employed with them again. Please respond and inform me how to be part of the HG team once again."
good,"A typical day at work was sending out RFQs, placing orders, any others specialized projects that popped up had to have special attention. I learned many things in the Procurement world. Learning about terms and conditions was an ongoing process, I learned bits and pieces about import/export, a bit about foreigjn orders and lots of other things that don't come immediately to mind. I was able to strengthen my negotiating skills. I really enjoyed working with my suppliers. I had some really good relationships. The hardest part of the job was to make everyone happy. I had so many REQs on a daily basis that it was tough keeping up. They can age quickly and it's not always easy buying those parts in a timely manner. Due to obsolence, price, delivery, and others issues made it sometimes difficult to get parts when needed. Also any supplier that would not accept NG's T&Cs, was tough because neither party wanted to make concessions. Very challenging. I loved my co-workers. There was some really good management and some not so good. I personally do not like micro-managers. I like to be able to do my job and not be micro-managed. I also like to have management that is accessible when needed. It was a stressful jobs at times, but I really enjoyed it and loved learning new things."
good,"Exciting, innovative, interesting workplace. Workdays were long, work was intense and complex. I learned how creative people can be and how productive a team can be. Management was spread too thin. Co-workers were wonderful. The hardest part of the job was responding quickly to the constant change. The most enjoyable part of the job was solving problems for my internal customers. Bringing a smile to a manager's face is priceless."
good,We have had many layoffs in the past 18 months and expect more. I am interested in leaving the defense market and re-locate close to my home in NC in a commercial type of industry.
good,I was a contractor so that I was not able to enjoy all of the benefits of working for this company! Although my time I was short I take away with me new skills that I wouldnt of otherwise have gained!
good,"If you want to advance your career quickly, this is the place. Great place to work and constantly innovating in the industry. Put in the hours and the over time and you will get noticed by people."
good,"I have been at this company for 20 years. They look out for their people. I have noticed a recent trend of hiring those right out of college.  This is how NG keeps their costs down. They are good, but they are expensive. This helps offset that.  However, they easily get rid of those that have been there for years because their salary starts getting up there. They haven't always chosen the best leaders. Senior leadership is great, but lower level leadership needs improvement.  Overall, I am very happy with NG."
good,Company has many perks for employees and always has fun activities. Can be stressful at times but aren't most jobs? Definitively a great place to get valuable experience!
good,"A typical day may start at 5:00am or 9:30am due to the flexible hours, which is great for someone who isn't a morning person. You can also choose for the most part to work 40 hours or rack up overtime if you choose. The 9/80 scheduled with every other Friday off is great, too. At the same time, coming in later or choosing to take advantage of the 3 day weekends isn't always viewed favorably despite no one saying anything to you. After taking this job and relocating to another state I was informed that I will have to frequently work at other facilities outside of the state, which did not translate well with my family. Management has changed frequently without warning along with expectations and workloads. Coming from a military background where a TDY mentality is strong, I have found many people here share the same mentality, that this work is temporary and that money rather than the work being done is the most important thing. It makes it difficult to build a long term career when everyone thinks and acts that way. The pay is great, the employer title is great and the work being done is great. Unfortunately, I have quickly found that the hardest part of this job is surviving the office politics, cutthroat contractors, and ever-changing travel expectations that were hidden during the on boarding process."
good,"The day to day activities were routine and the people that worked there were also easy going. "
good,Working at Northrop Grumman affords a professional environment and opportunities for advancement. The nature of being a government contractor does make for precarious job security.
good,"This is not my current job. My job at Northrop Grumman relocated to another state, at which time I moved to another company. However, my time at Northrop Grumman was excellent, with a great mentor and wonderful teamwork."
good,Northrop Grumman has an excellent record keeping employees.  They care about the work that they do.  Many events are held to keep employees motivated.  Training is not as thorough as it could be.
good,"Working for Northrop Grumman has been a great experience both positively and negatively. I enjoy what I do but there are some managers that don't need to be managers.  I know this is not or should not be the norm but there has been instances where a poor performing manager is promoted and given different responsibilities whereas he or she could have been let go and hired a more competent and able bodied individual willing to put in the time and effort to ensure a smooth running and stable environment."
good,Typical work days are fast paced and very eventful.  I worked on a contract that was full of modifications and lots of projects.  So there was never a dull moment.
good,Too slow of a place for my liking.  But I am looking for something that will provide a challenge to work in. The good news is that they have a lot of locations and opportunities are all over.
good,I worked for North Grumman for 22 years I have traveled and relocated the only reason I left is due to layoff.  I participated in in fund raising activities for charitable contributions for homeless shelters and wounded warriors.
good,"great place to work as long as you are on the hourly non exempt side of things, once you cross over to exempt salary side of the house things change drastically to include lower pay and longer hours"
good,"On a typical day at work, for the most part I work independently on subcontract control for government property management.  Because I'm a more senior level, my projects are assigned in the beginning of the year and I coordinate site visits, conduct audits, and write reports.  I also interact with other staff in completing contactor self assessments and review files for completeness.  My manger is hands off unless there is an issue that needs intervention, which is rarely.   The culture in my immediate workplace is one where property management experts (most of which have 40 years experience) strive for excellence in everything that they do.  We are all detail oriented people and work together to achieve the best quality work product.  "
good,Great place to learn and Grow as a employee I had the oppuntunity to work with some of the best SOF operators and travel the world and train the TSOC's and GCC's providing best practices and insights
good,"Northrop has some of the highest standards of excellence I've ever encountered. It's daunting at first, you worry about living up to the expectations set forth. However, I can say that the work environment puts excellence within your grasp. State of the art equipment, paired with the best and the brightest individuals in their fields make a recipe for success. If you, like me, always felt like the smartest person in the room, get ready for a slice of humble pie, because the folks at Northrop will surprise you."
good,"Northrop was a great company to work for. Things were interesting all the time. Everyone worked as a team, and the management was great. The hardest part of my job was that it was contractual and once the contracts ended you were not always able to find another contract to pick you up."
good,Excellent company for balancing work life. Culture is one of outsourcing major portions of the infrastructure. IT and development of systems is what they specialize in.
good,"Flexible hours, I have a great manager, my work load and day to day activities are decided by the customer and not NGC. The customer has an interesting mission. NGC provides the opportunity and funding for education and certifications."
good,Northrop is one of the best places to work.  There is plenty of room for advancement and great life/work balance.  Management is always there to listen and quick to respond to any issues.
good,Everyday a team of great people work toward creating a overall better future for all of us. Options to work on a variety of different projects.

good,"A typical day as an Low Observable Engineer is supporting a schedule for production and a test enviornment. I typical shoot aircraft parts with a portable 3-Band Radar (S, KU, and X) in V-Pol and H-Pol and verify our test data matches our predictied data. I do the same process for same parts load with diffrernt core materals, top coatings and RAM. This data is then compared against live data from the field. The end result is called a roll-up. "
good,"I enjoyed working at Ingalls shipyard because there was a lot of different job to do. I did various types of job when I started I was in the warehouse, then I worked as a welder, I also painted, used various type of equipment worked with alot of different people. I worked very long hours."
good,"I provide support the USPS General Counsel, Office of the Inspector General, Postal Inspection Service, FOIA Office and other"
good,"NG, Tenneco & Sperry Marine different name same building.  The work enviroment prior to beening ""Work Force"" reduced.   I worked in assembly and engineering.  "
good,"Typically the calls were deep in queue because there are never enough agents to handle the calls.  Password resets are a majority of the calls.  A few calls require troubleshooting but everything is very well documented and deskside support can address anything necessary to resolve an issue that cannot be addressed during a call.  "
good,"Day are chill, could get boring but everyone always gets along and everyone is family."
good,"I loved working for Northrop Grumman, unfortunately I was laid off."
good,"Hight volume of service calls which are inbound from internal Huamn Resources, Talen Aquisition, Employee's and vendors.  I have learned to be very versitile in an ever changing work place.  Management is exceptional and the hardest part about my job is wanting to assist the employee's beyond my limits.  The most enjoyable part of my job is reaping the compliments on the level of customer service I am able to provide in a very timley manner.  I truly enjoy interfacing with employee's directly as well a provide briefings both virtual and onsite."
good,"Ran manchinery,inspected parts , inventory , worked with great people"

good,Good company to work for to apply and learn knowledge and experience
good,"The job that i perform everyday is very challenging.but i work well in that environment.I get along with all my co-workers,and most of all i love my customers. they look forward to seeing me everyday as well as i look forward to seeing them. Everyday is a good day, when i walk into those doors to clock in, The hardest part of this job is making and carrying those three gallon jug of coffee all day for eight hours.The most enjoyable part of this job, is the customer tell me all day and everyday how much they appreciate me and my hard work, just to make them happy.That is my high light of everyday for three years."
good,The job I have now provides the flexibility to be proactive and reactive to customer needs and requirements. Thinking outside the box is something I enjoy and excel at day in and day out.
good,"Fun place to work, interesting sights, right on the bay but not allowed to go fishing."
good,Team players
good,"World class technologies, fascinating products (Nuclear carriers, Nuclear subs, F18s, E10, Globalhawk UAV, B2 bombers, spacecraft for NASA and the governement. Great coworkers, exceptional engineering talent"
good,"My experience at Northrop Grumman was outstanding. I worked started 7/1986 until 6/2012. I learned everything about my profession, how to be a professional, how to work under pressure of deadlines, how to lead and how to push myself beyond what I thought I could do. I truly enjoyed my experiences working at Northrop Grumman"
good,Northrop-Grumman has the contract with the US Postal Service for the repair and maintenance for electronic and mechanical equipment necessary for the quick movement of the mail. I did to the component level repair on printed circuit boards and other equipment as required.
good,"incredibly inclusive, well compensated, multiple employee resource groups, engagement survey results are directly encompassed in the companies efforts. the company truly sets up all employees for success"
good,My daily times were filled with troubleshooting tasks and documentation of tests processes. It is fun filled and filled with learning opportunities. I personally want to do other tasks to help with career growth.
good,"I’ve worked for two Northrop Grumman facilities, one in Florida the other in Louisiana, and enjoyed working for both. Would love to return to Florida where I started as a contractor but was hired as a direct employee!"
good,"Its an amazing company to work for but i working there as a contractor. I wish there was enough budget to keep workers like myself with no active clearance there. I enjoyed my co workers that i worked with and supervisors. The job duties, being exposed and able to learn and take on newer tasks that was not in my job description. Northrop Grumman is a place where you can definitely advance in positions if funds were available for contractors. The work culture is awesome and i would definitely come back to work for the company if offered a position. According to current employees the benefits are amazing."
good,It is a challenging yet satisfying place to work. I learned that when working in Aerospace things change like the wind blows. I learned to be extremely flexible and continue to work hard.
good,"Great place to work,  They had lots of work and different projects which tested your skill set.  The team was helpful and setup internal education session bi weekly."
good,"Northrop Grumman as a whole is an excellent company. Benefits/pay are on par with other defense contractors (below commercial market), the benefits are comparable to other large companies. "
good,I was hired on for a temporary contract.  I knew it was only going to be 18 months or so.  It was a good place to work.  I could have stayed with them if I would have been willing to move to Maryland but I still had kids in school here at that time and wasn't going to move. So I got the job with DoD.
good,Everyone gets along with others and the mentors are willing to work with you. The location is close to any one who lives in the AV. And the company pays for your college.
good,"I found the environment at Northrop Grumman to be highly collaborative, and the people very professional.  As a program manager, this made my job extremely rewarding."
good,"High temp operations, responsible for maintenance and repair of  the C-2 aircraft due to various flight testing, which provides critical updates and upgrades to the C-2 aircraft currently operating."
good,I was in charge of all the coping of classified documents.  The management was great to work with.  I enjoyed all the ladies that I worked with.  I learned a lot about the airplanes that were made.
good,"Northrop Grumman has various entities and each has management and functionality unique to that specific site. NG works to keep the life/work balance for employees intact with off Fridays and a week off at the end of the year. This is beneficial to keep employees focused and help them routinely recharge. They, also, allow employees to donate time to another employee in the event  of major life challenges. They promote community involvement and volunteering."
good,"Great people, good culture. Pay is good, benefits are at par with the area and industry. Management is structured a bit odd, they have what is called a silo management structure, which means my managers boss is located at corp. We report to corporate level only."
good,"I loved working at Northrop Grumman."
good,This is a nice place to work and we are often allowed other opportunities to advance and take on other projects. Employees are offered decent health benefits and are able to work from home as well.
good,"Opportunity for young technical professionals.  Committed to engagement, diversity and inclusion.  Clearance is important.  Most jobs in dc or CA.  Lots of educational opportunities"
good,"Work involves a daily standup, individual work time, working group meetings, and sometimes training. "
good,"Great place to work besides management, I love what I do and enjoy the atmosphere. The manager likes to micromanage which makes it hard. to do your job"
good,"They have treated me very well over the years. Days are fairly relaxed but work is still completed. Very volatile working arrangement, as with anything related to government contracts its is feast or famine. Some months it will be very slow with not a lot going on and others will be long hour days with no breaks for months. High level management seems to be an old boys club where friends and family get hired in and promoted more frequently than someone with no ties higher up. As of recently, the management seems to care more about stock prices and profits rather than employees but they are working to change that. Lower level management is usually quite good however and genuinely seem to care about their folks. Hardest part of the job is the actual work, it is highly technical in nature with a steep learning curve. Training is very weak and nearly non-existent, putting the burden of learning the system on you personally. Once you learn the system however, the job is quite enjoyable since the stuff you actually work on is very cool. Overall, its a pretty good place to work."
good,"The people are great.  There is/was a good old boy network, but now management has morphed into a Good old Girls network."
good,"Northrop Grumman is a great company, hands down, with multiple sectors for employment for all walks of life. The company is very involved in it's communities."
good,"I interned at Northrop Grumman, and was eventually offered full-time employment. It was a great experience, starting out in the IT field, and it was a great place in which to learn. It was a shock when the company closed the office. I think the company could have done a better job at finding us suitable work within the company."
good,I enjoyed working here. I learned a lot and it was challenging. Unfortunately I was laid off for budgetary reasons. I would work for them again if I could.

My colleges and managers are great to work with, professional and everyone gets along great. The company is very concerned about work life balance and very supportive. I also feel that Northrop Grumman is a very ethical company that cares about their workforce. The hardest part of the job is not knowing whether contracts will be renewed and if you will have a job. The most enjoyable part of my job is the folks I work with and being able to take on my responsibilities. I am most definitely a ""people"" person and ensure that my team is happy and productive. I'm know as the ""problem fixer"" and employees come to me for advice and to keep morale up. We are getting a new manger next week and the first thing he did was come to me and ask me to convey to the team that he has an open door policy. He gave me a great compliment and stated that he knows people trust me and that I am a people person and I have the general feel of morale for the team.

However, if you can stand that kind of pace, this is a company with which anyone should be proud to work."

I learned how to put together on-line lessons to include self-tests, work with Photoshop, how graphic artists take a picture and turn it into a 3D rendering that functions. One manager in particular you could count on for anything you needed. The other managers at that site were lacking in almost everything. Co-workers were awesome; always ready to help you out!

good,Fantastic work relationship. Completely satisfied with work environment. Never felt like a contractor as I have felt in other companies.  Fully professional.
good,"It's a great place to work although it was ATK when I was hired, which makes my review better than it should be. Northrop came in and changed role titles advancement structure pay and time off, so the management came from there. If it wasn't for that than not so much."

good,The staff was comprised of many talented people.  I learned something new nearly every day.  I was busy and often had competing priorities.  Most of the management was very approachable and highly competent. My co-workers were skilled.  They never hesitated to lend a hand should the need arise.
good,"Focused on growing employees, mentoring, promoting from within.  Strong culture of diversity, inclusion.  Highly recommended for up and coming individuals."

Schedules are flexible within certain guidelines and work-life balance is considered.Career development is stressed and employees have access to many career development tools and information.

I know not everyone has had the same experiences as me, but most high performers can find a path to success in this company.

The work was really exciting and the variety was exceptional, because the projects we performed for the U.S. Government were always changing.  I received a majority of my computer experience there--especially working with databases, and even wrote a little bit of code there, with Visual Basic.

They would do fun activities during lunch and breaks to build team morale, and provided a great family environment. But seeing as how they are a defense contract manufacturing company, they are subject to government budget fluctuations, and as a result of government sequestration the job security is not what it once was. "

Helped security team manage an over 10 year listing of classified documents, software and equipment while waiting for a permanent contact assignment. Management was totally supportive of my helping the SCIF security team. The hardest part of this job was combining several different versions of an Excel spreadsheet document into one usable format.

good,Great place to work ! Excellent benefits .. Management needs improvement too many bosses. Hardest part of the job is traveling put the country all the time
good,"Northrop (NGC) does not lay off. I repeat . . . Northrop does not do layoffs. Layoffs are extremely rare within the company and nowadays, if they do layoffs it is after the company offered employees lots of options to move to another program that they turned down. As far as benefits they are comparable to every other major company in the industry, but I feel that NGC values their employees a lot more than Lockheed and Boeing. I have first hand experience with this. I also believe that they pay better salaries."

good,"An amazing place to begin your engineering career in high school. Learned a lot during the school year, and was given real work experience over the summers. I do wish we worked more hours in the summer because more money would have been better. Plus it would have given us more time to complete our project. But overall, it was a great experience!"
good,I started out at my job not knowing much about the department I was in. I loaded parts and tooling.

From there I managed various Laser Application projects and was brought into Procurement and was given the opportunity to travel and learn about Supply Chain Management."

good,"I joined Northrup Grumman as a contractor, so technically I didn't work for them, effectively they were who I dealt with on a day-to-day basis.  The management likes to tighten deadlines but with throw resources(people) at the problem when a risk to that deadline shows up.  Most of the developers I met were competent and helpful.  The culture was corporate and traditional because the customer was the military and they provide the facility for obvious security reasons.  Imagine working alongside your customer every day in the same building, weird setuo, but that's government for you.  Overall, it was good and I learned a lot, but not a super fun experience."
good,"Excellent workplace culture."

good,"My job was pretty boring, but Northrop Grumman treated its employees well. For security reasons I cannot describe the actual work that I did. However, there were other people I worked with that did the exact same job that I did, and it was easy to see that they did not have the same employee/employer relationship as my fellow northrop employees did."

It really was a team effort and every ones opinions were taken into consideration.  Working with the learners on a daily basis could sometimes be challenging, but I like a challenge.  I could not have asked for a better team of co-workers, both with my company Expertus and with NGC. Working remotely presents its own challenges, but we always had great communication within the team and I never felt like I was working alone. I would work for either company again."

Having had a Master's degree paid for in full, I can attest to value of the education reimbursement benefit alone.  Further than that, however, there are online training resources from multiple providers which is great for collecting continuing education requirements needed to keep certifications active.

The company has some solid benefits that align pretty much with other large government contracting companies. The leadership of Northrop Grumman has been stellar in leading the organization to achieve the mission. During my 11 1/2 years with Northrop Grumman I have worked in a ""gray badge"" environment. That being said, it was fairly easy to pick out the Northrop Grumman folks from the other company's because Northrop does an excellent job of hiring high quality people. The hardest but most enjoyable part of the job has been the extremely fluid dynamic of supporting the mission and Northrop's continued strive to improve quality and efficiency. If you want to be challenged and have opportunities to grow and stretch, Northrop Grumman is the place for you!"

When those customers were satisfied, I began arranging the current tickets with the oldest first, but prioritized in an order of importance. I very much liked all but my last manager, however I never revealed that, as I always treat my superiors with respect. The company went through nearly as many management changes as the number of years I served there. My co-workers were all hardworking and knowledgeable individuals that I considered part of my friendship pool. Being at the top-level of support for some of the issues I ran into made obtaining assistance impossible, but the Internet was always there for research and reference manuals. The smiling faces of customers that I've successfully assisted are the rewards I reap."

good,"It was the best place that I have ever worked in. If one worked their tail off it was worth it because the end product was a military concoction that saved many of our soldiers lives and that along amid itself was commendable and rewarding. During the time I've been there in California before the transfer of the program to Huntsville  Alabama I was presented with various awards and  accolades from the program managers I worked with. This was in the form of promotions, bonuses and recognition awards including cash. I was given free reign to use imagination and creativity to get things done. Quality worked arm in arm with the program itself and showed full support to help the program prosper. Other Quality Departments that I have worked for over the years were never that way and they stumped the progress rather than improve the situation. Perhaps this is why Quality overall is not well received by many people in the industry. If everyone is respected and qualified then there is no reason not to work in harmony."
