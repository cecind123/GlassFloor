rating,review
bad,"Will work you like a slave with no appreciation towards employees. District management promoted employees based on the store manager's discretion. If the store manager wanted to get rid of that specific person, that person can/will receive a promotion. Thankless job."
bad,"Benefits are poor. 401K match was 1%. Vacation package is two weeks. I worked there for two years and never got a pay raise because I was at the top of the pay band. When I asked how I could move to the next level, I found out there was no plan and no career advancement. The job description sounded great when I interviewed, but when I arrived there was no training and no specific job duties assigned to the job. I was also bullied and harassed by a coworker. I documented to incidents and talked to HR. Nothing was done so I left.specific job duties"
bad,No review  nothing more to say  I don’t enjoy working for this company I need better employeement thank you. Better hours better management to succeed
bad,Horrible place to work.  Too many work hours. No professional Management. Retention rate is high for leadership and employees.  No HR support due to newly appointed HR Specialist.
bad,"This place sucks since UNFI took over. We all liked our jobs when it was SuperValu. Now even our managers hate working there, they can't say it but you can tell the difference in the way they act since UNFIT took over..UNFIT don't care about us working class people they just interested in corporate greed and screw the people that make the money for them."
bad,"I wouldnt recommend supervalu which is now UNFI to my worse enemy. It is not a company that cares about its employees. I worked there almost 2 years as a forklift operator, never late, always went above and beyond on my job duites , worked over whenever i cld and never got noticed . Management including HR is a joke , its absolutely worse then being in high school. The only good thing about supervalu when i worked there was the pay. This review is not to bad mouth this company nor said with any hard feelings , its a warning to good people who work hard and take pride in their skills and work. Please consider as many more companies as you can before taking a job here , let it be  ur last and only option."
bad,"Terrible management, they do not even know you.  I would not recommend working here.  Corporate office is too removed from the actual work to be able to drive the business."
bad,"Company overall needs improvement, systems are dated, no work/life balance. Benefits could be better.................................................."
bad,very fast paced. downfall is you never know when you are getting off of work. you have a schedule but they always keep you a few hours later. they also mandatory you on your days off. you work weekends also
bad,not a great environment to grow and develop yourself. It will however teach you how to survive in some less than ideal working situations. No accountability starting at the top.
bad,Started out good job but turned into nightmare.   Management lies about what is going on.   If they don’t like you they do everything possible to get rid of you
bad,"Since UNFI bought the company, they have been nothing but slave drivers. Very little margin for a personal life. UNFI management are tough, causing employee moral to be at a all time low. Pay is good, but not worth breaking your back over."
bad,Worked with some nice people. Very fast-paced environment. Location was perfect for me at that particular point in time. Started as a contract hire and then asked to interview for permanent position.
bad,Horrible just plain horrible mandory overtime mandory to come in on days off it doesn’t make sense I literally was fired for not coming to work on my off day
bad,"UPPER MANAGEMENT are horrible  lack of professionalism . No job security HR is useless... pay is good when payroll isn’t messing up your time.. Treat warehouse workers like slaves with mandatory overtime, managers block exits for workers to leave, unorganized, stressful place."
bad,"Honestly, The only way that I knew that my supervisors or the corporation at large knew that I existed was because I was cut a check twice a month. It seemed that SuperValu had subscribed to some sort of chaos business model in which the points were made up and the product didn't matter."
bad,"The job was  not  hard but the environment  was  not  good,  you work in the  freezer  and it gets really cold. There's  a lot of lifting heavy boxes."
bad,During my time at SUPERVALU I found it difficult to deliver what was asked by management due to constantly moving targets and conflicting direction from various levels of leadership and so much time wasted in constant meetings.
bad,It's a decent place to work. It just needs better management. It is somewhat a safe place to work. Its alot of favoritism that goes on there. If it's place you want to  make money then it's the plce
bad,"I worked at SuperValu for years and it was a fair company to work for. The company bought out Unified and somehow their management, which was riddled in mismanagement took over management at SuperValu and ran the company to a highly stressful place that lost millions in food product because of incompetent management.They are moving operations 50 miles south to Chahailis because they in turn were bought out by UnFi. UnFi is gonna cut wages and take most benefits away."
bad,"I got laid off after a merger, but before I left watched most of the top leadership retire, resign or become powerless. Corporate talked about learning from us, but was deaf to anything we had to say."
bad,"After 13 years at SuperValu the company was bought by UNFI. The new owners are closing the Tacoma DC, refuse to acknowledge their responsibility in regards to a collectively bargained contract, and are moving all of the jobs to Centralia."
bad,"They definitely need to work on their way they treat their employees, if you have worked there a long time they favorite you, if you are just starting out, they don’t really like you. If you make a mistake several times in a row because you don’t understand something, it definitely hurts when they let you go over the smallest mistakes you have ever made."
bad,If your focused and have the energy it's a great place to make good money. I had some personal issues with this place myself but all together this place is pretty decent to make good money and fast.
bad,"It is a typical environment. You show up, get your work done and go home. There is little remarkable (Or negative) to say about the job. Occasionally work load would get to be too much for work hours and I had to stay late, but it was only a handful of times."
bad,"If your into clicks your fine I just went at a  fast paste and was a thinker and  was not into clicks ,I always thought if I can make the company more money they would figure out a way to keep me employed I was wrong!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
good,Not a bad place to work its just you have a certain amount of time to pick a certain amout of items. Most of the employees don't go on breaks to make sure they hit their numbers. You go from hot to cold environments so you would need to keep a jacket with you. You have to run to get some items which is not safe.
good,"Always something new to learn everyday."
good,"Great place to work for as the money. Weird work hours, management is not that great. Over all experience was good though met some great people along the way"
good,Hard to keep up with a 90% day rating stressful environment overworked long shifts cold temperature  Fast Pace High Strung lifestyle did order selections pallet jacks clean and maintain  safe environment
good,Bad management makes the job a lot tougher than it is. Constantly micromanaged and treated like children. Not a lot of room for promotions. Shifts were short.
good,Spent working hours lifting packages to build pallets to be shipped to stores. Spent 4 hours mandatory overtime most days of the week.It was a union job there fore a good paying job.
good,"nothing to say about this company. it is different for every individual that works there. Like any other place, it depends on who you know or who likes you that determines if you will advance within the company."
good,"This is a good job if you need a year of experience in procurement, inventory analyzation and forecasting. Most likely you will feel frustrated at the 6 month mark, but I would tell you to stick it out. At the one year you will become a Buyer II and get a 10% pay increase. And you get it even if you've had problems. Unfortunately the job and the stifling atmosphere will start to wear on you because it's a losing battle if you want to fix anything in the category you work within. The recent bonus they are dangling to the buyers in hopes of making the constant turnover stop is unknown factor. UNFI Corporate doesn't get information, have concrete or solid numbers to give the Procurement team. The bonus is based on too many outside factors you can't control, and on the whole category, not your work individually. Which in my opinion will only cause friction within a category. Especially when you consider the teams not getting a bonus will only lose more employees and have a faster turnover, therefore that department will never improve. My biggest issue with how the Procurement department is run is four things. 1. Everyone is scared of management and having to talk to the boss. I've witnessed how the head of the department confronts individuals and it is done with a lack of respect. Essentially, they are barked at. The people below him, at least a portion, mimic the same bad behavior so it's cyclical. 2. There is no foresight on what's best for the company. The slogan is ""you can only control your desk"". I have never witnessed so many professionals only concerned with covering their"
good,"Compensation = Very good"
good,Its Aight Nothing Fancy About It They Want You To Work Your Butt Off Even More Even Tho We Are Already Workin Hard Already .                    Uuuhhh
good,"This grocery store is a great start to being introduced to the retail work field. Due to this store being in a small neighbourhood, the busy periods did not last long, this is perfect for training to be a cashier. i learned how to operate a till, greet customers, organize product the most efficiently to be carried out of the store in a plastic bag, suggest products to customers based on what i notice them buy. The hardest part for me was to be faster in bagging groceries, i was so cautious id take longer than i expected too. the most enjoyable part was helping customers, i love sharing my knowledge on cooking and giving new insight to customers, thats something that has stuck with me still."
good,There appears to be an internal feud with the dispatchers as there is always some type of discord going on. Hired as full time yet after first two weeks I was on-call.
good,Very little opportunity for advancement. Compensation below industry standards. SuperValu was purchased by UNFI which turned it into a noninclusive work atmosphere
good,I liked working there didn’t enjoy the shift I had and management was hard to deal. But there is new management all same workers though and they go through quite a few staff
good,Miss the daily exercise keeping me in shape and the coworkers and being competitive with being able to work independently but as a team and always staying busy
good,"A high-intensity distribution center focused on maximizing through-put, with very little regard for individual employees. Management quality ranges from very good to downright terrible. Compensation and benefits are good, and if you can keep up with the pace, job security decently high."
good,Worked at least 14 hours a day. I only got one day off a week. I did not receive overtime due to me being salary. The people I was over made more money than me every week.
good,No Comments i really don't have anything real negative to say about the job my manger was one of my favorite he worked around my school schedule and if i needed a to request a day off he would work with me.
good,I like the place. Hours are great if you like the 3 on 3 off kind of schedule. Long days but pays off at the end. Great benefits. The union has alot to offer.
good,Long as you have alot of years invested in the company your future with the company is safe. If you are a new hire or dont have that many years you wont be guaranteed a job in the future.
good,Working at supervalu was really a blast to me I loved it and i actually learn alot of new things working there such as learning how to properly function a stand up forklift and stand up pallet jacks
good,Assistant manager was awful. Was run like a battleship and would not think twice about shouting at you in front of other staff. I have merchandised for a very long time and I knew my job. This woman made me feel like a novice and yet all she did was follow you around and cause problems if not merchandised swiftly.
good,Management was okay. didn't have a problem there besides some of my coworkers. Needs more diversity in my department.    I learned that some of these jobs will hire anybody.
good,Great job great place it wasn't that hard people out there nice and helpful.it was it great experience.the pay rate was good long time break really it was great working for them.
good,"Quick summer job for myself to earn some money for college, plenty of friendly staff. Well suited to students, flexible working hours with the ability to progress."
good,"I was very happy working for Unified Grocers, prior to it's acquisition by Supervalu. I had experienced longevity and in return gave it dedication and commitment. I cannot provide a review on the company Supervalu as I am not familiar with their practices."
good,Work with a vocalist that gives orders and let loose on your order. Fun co workers and supervisors work with you until you learn the process.  Both the freezer and dry areas are a cool way to change up your work environment.
good,"Your life will be Supervalu. The money is okay. But as union member the top perk are the healrh benefits they give. They are unmatched. Eye dental overall wellness for your family for a monthly rate of only $60.0. But you will work 5,6, seven days a week ten hour days. Almost no life.  A good job to support the family."
good,"What made working here great was the managers and staff, the atmosphere was nice, just stressful when really packed, no help at checkouts when needed, or responded to in a nasty way by a couple of staff. Had the best manager and supervisors. Unfortunately low salary not suitable for working family, no benefits that I know of. Other than that, people who are nice and helpful try their best. Other issue included working way past closing time due to being understaffed but not managements fault. Lazy staff also made it harder."
good,Loved the pay and shifty at SuperValu but they hire you as a temp and if they don't have work you are the first to be sent home. So when trying to support your family it is not a good place to work because I was only getting 10 hours a week and having to drive into work and be sent home.
good,"Very easy to make money a lot of hours nonstop Overtime."
good,"Working at SuperValu, I learned a lot about teamwork and patience. When working in a grocery store, you have many different responsibilities. SuperValu really is not only a good place to learn basic work skills, but it is also a fun place to work. It was my other family."
good,"I enjoyed working in that environment, it is cold so some could not handle it as well. The pay is good, and the benefits are great as well. Culture more welcoming than target was."
good,Great people but management are known for micromanagement. You are assigned a title and yet they continue to delegate more work yet the pay does equal the amount of work. No loyalty to long term employees.
good,"Many positives, learning, growth, with to many changes in all aspects of business that effects the final user the retailer."
good,It was a really good paying job where they allowed you to be independent. I would recommend this job to anyone who can withstand the freezing temperatures.
good,"This was a high school, early college job for me to make some extra money. Hours were flexible around school and any outside plans I had. Good managers, always something to do to keep me busy."
good,"Working at Supervalu was rewarding, by getting to know the customers individually, and feeling the satisfaction of being able to help them with their shopping experience.  Its especially rewarding when they come in and look for you or ask for your help."
good,"Small town here again, located just off of highway 82 & highway 9. Supervalu was 1 of 2, grocery stores.  The other being a Piggly Wggly store that was a couple of blocks away. We had fun working at Supervalu, good mgrs. & a good owner, who like me lived in Ackerman, 15 miles away."
good,Supervalu was really nice to hire me for my first job. The hours were very flexible and management was very understanding about you taking time off if you requested it. Overall it was a decent first job. I wouldn't really want to work there for the rest of my life because there really isn't any opportunities to move up.
good,Quick paced environment with competitive atmosphere. relaxed environment with clear expectations of their employees. Secure facility with plenty of commodities for staff
good,"UNFI and SUPERVALU are becoming one. The merger builds on our industry leading assortment of products, expertise and forward-focused approach. We'll continue to deliver the right food solutions to all our customers and we're excited about our future together."
good,I loved working there because you were able to work freely and productively.  Management was very helpful and most employees were upbeat and positive due to the friendly environment.
good,"the job is a fast paced,very strenuous labor,and sometimes long hours,high standards,and always have to be aware of your surroundings great pay,great benefits"
good,"working with stores to increase there Private Label penetration."
good,"Supervalu is a fun fasted paced work environment, once you get the hang of it, it's a amazing place to work, the staff, customers are all wonderful to work with and serve"
good,working in the cold environment which we were short on staff and we actually had a large order of merchandise to run but we made it through the night with no heart broken and accomplish the all task 89500 merchandises/25 routes.
good,"Great place to work "
good,This was the best job I ever had pay and benefits wise. The thing that I didn’t like was I never knew what time I was getting off. The benefits were still good when I left.
good,"Decent work environment, good community. I enjoy my coworkers"
good,Supervalu was a great career opportunity for all ages. Fast paced with lots of lifting as well as forklift work. Was a union shop so the benefits offered were perfect for everyone. 40 hour work weeks with great pay made it easy for those to make a livable wage.
good,A typical day at work is going out of your way to complete your job task. You learn different isles and locations throughout the warehouse daily. Management is very helpful and wants to see you strive.
good,It is one of the best paying jobs in this area.it is a physical job if you are not in good shape when you start you will be by the time you work there a couple of months.
good,The other employees that I worked with were all very friendly. I became close with a lot of them that I use to work with. It was like we were all a huge family and took care of each other.
good,I love how we had our space to do our work. Manager supervisor was always their when needed. My supervisor was one of the best I had ever had in my work years. If I could go back I would but it’s not the same when your being a new company.
good,All and All iwould to work again for SuperValu the company a job you love to come to work everyday and get the job done management where easy to talk to that's what make the job easy.
good,"Fun environment, great people to work with, great compensation.  Highly recommended working there if you like hard work.  supervisors need more flexibility"
good,The. Managers wernt very good at their job and one was abusing his power and was getting a little rude.the other casheir were nice the customers were lovely i liked working there
good,SuperValu was a great opportunity to gain overall experience as a forklift operator and warehouse employee. Its a fast paced environment that helps develop multi tasking skills. I enjoyed working with a group of individuals steadfast on reaching a common goal of satisfactory production.
good,was on stand up forklift filling store orders daily work in freezer department first shift 50 hours a week like the place add accident could make it back in time
good,A typical day involved riding a double pallet jack throughout the warehouse pulling orders from picking tickets in a timely manner. using a shrink wrapping machine to wrap pallets to be shipped.
good,A company that will keep you satisfied and stores happy a place with goals and dreams and better opportunities while you are there it great place to work.
good,The only reason I left because an old boss called me up to take a Bakery Merchandiser job with a supermarket chain in the corporate office. More responsibility and more pay.
good,A life changing experience that I wouldn't change for the life of me and would love to do the position again!!! Tight nit Family feeling that was amazing to have the comparability to have!
good,"I pay bills I live with younger siblings"
good,Supervalu is a great place to work for have a lot of potential in different areas of the warehouse I've learned a lot being through the apprenticeship program and I would recommend them to anybody
good,"A part-time warehouse worker/order selector uses voice commands to pick the products, palletize the products, and wrap the pallets using a power pallet jack to navigate the warehouses. These positions work a variety of hours per week depending on business needs as the hours are not guaranteed (may be released early or may be required to work overtime). Starting pay is $22.38/hr."
good,I enjoy working for SuperValu the programs that they have for their customers and the managers that manage these programs are very sophisticated and educated with the most advanced programs in the field
good,"Everyone was down to earth at SuperValu.  I was never micro-managed, which means a lot! They are professionals and treat their coworkers like friends.  Nice Place!!"
good,Great place to work at. Great environment. Exceptional co workers. Stable job. Fair hours. Flexible schedule. Fun bosses. Fair pay. Fair time off. Fun environment.
