bad,The coach and Chestnuthill has poor management needed the store manager or assistant manager has a real grasp  of how to manage a store. Associates and supervisor were nice and kept the work environment friendly. There was a lot of talk of moving a lot of people but instead they choose to out source the position and lie to the staff. They don’t pay well seasonal staff gets paid $13 . And associates $15
bad,"Orari folli. Notturni intensi e la giornata successiva sempre in turno."
bad,They don't pay their stock team what they should for the amount of work that we do. Lazy and rude managers and are very unprofessional. Understaff in the stock department but still blame the stock team for not completing everything.
bad,"Management completely not mature enough for their ""position""   Character assassination of other employees was significant.  It's amazing how they can lie through the corporate meetings and visits.  The  ""Coach"" retail world will or should wake up soon to the hypocrisy of it all."
bad,"A typical day at work is organizing purses all the time, and sales as many purses to people. Bad part about it is theirs no commission, and never really get a raise. A person can be working their for year or more and hardly get a raise. The job isn't hard, only gets hard on the holidays. The only thing good about it is they work with your schedule, its great for people who go to school."
bad,They don't take care of their products. They don't treat the customers fairly. Managers text on their phones at any giving time. No respect for authority.
bad,I have nothing positive to say other than I got discounts on bags sometimes. Manager was poor and schedule was poor. They make you type emails and answer phone calls at the same time & you get in trouble for not sending emails out fast enough. They should have a separate internet response team like most companies.
bad,"Poor management, that needs to be fired! "
bad,"Day to day work, conducting meetings, resolving user's issue. Participating in meetings for cross module to discuses issue related to other consultant. For example Stock Transport order."
bad,"The company likes to micromanage its employee, and provide them little incentives for their hard work. Plus, the quality in the products are bad."
bad,1st day used rf scanner that was junk never needed it after that. Set up to fail .Racism is a problem there. Machine problems count against your productivity waiting on maintenance to fix or adjust machinery searched by security every time you walk in and out of facilities.
bad,"It's very popular brand, but I didn't like that the fact they don't have much detail on their products but logo. Nothing to talk about their products besides its price and the functionality."
bad,"Working at Coach has helped me determine that the world is NEVER black and white; only gray. That about sums things up, for me."
bad,Do not recommend if you want a life outside of work.
bad,"It was actually great when I first started! But when management changed that’s when Things got worse our sale and ratings went down, more Thefts! Turning people against each other. It felt like high school all over again with all the gossip and management sleeping with employees taking drugs on the clock and drinking in the building."
bad,Typical day consists of reaching your sales goal.I learned its best to work here if you're Chinese (managers treat them like god) . Managers sit in office and talk bad about everyone. They talk about their personal life. One of the managers bought their daughter to work on black Friday weekend as a volunteer for free lunch and dinner. Treat you like you're disposable. Employee discount has so many specifications. Don't waste your talent at this location specifically.
bad,"Would not recommend this sales job to anyone I cared about.  Was promised extra opportunity for bonuses, which we were never compensated for.  The environment was stressful and poorly organized.   Hours were all over the place  and you’re told you’ll work one weekend a month, but count on 3."
bad,I have never hated a job more than currently working for Coach. You work your employees to the bone and continue to ask for more even when they are already giving you over 100%. There are no clear training guidelines so everyone gets trained differently on the same thing.
bad,"The workplace culture here is very toxic and dysfunctional.  Organization is going through multiple changes, people do not know nor understand their roles and processes.  Senior management cannot be trusted and this trickles down to the employees.  The culture is so hyper competitive that colleagues backstab each other rather than support and collaborate,"
bad,Employees work hard and are driven to work for you. external management (area manager) did not care to bond with staff to see their work ethic. they pay very poorly but pay their managers very well. often would work 16 hour days with unreasonable expectations
bad,Management is at the lowest level. Poor is an understatement.
bad,"Place where I work is negative. Manager leads the team by micromanaging and gossip. Even the managers below her don’t feel safe or supported to do their jobs. Pay is fine, hours are terrible and they constantly ask to go home early or not come in at all. They care about numbers only and the manager doesn’t treat anyone on staff like we are important. Upper management was even notified and has done nothing to improve. Discount isn’t worth it as you find you buy items as a customer instead of an employee."
bad,Majority of the management do not know what they are doing half the time especially when it comes to talking to their employees and when they tell you they are there to support you they contradict themselves by leaving you when you have a question. You aren’t allowed to leave a certain area the whole time and if you do you get talked to and they are constantly observing you and always find something wrong even when you make a perfect sale. They don’t care if tourist treat you bad they just care about getting a bag in their hand with an accessory they don’t need to help their sales.
bad,for the xmas dinner we had to pay for a meal deal which included two drink tickets one salad and two slices of pizza. for the amount of money they make it was disgusting
bad,"Prime example of bullies in the workplace. The work environment was hostile and unbearable to properly function. Rude, disrespectful, insulting behavior from team leaders and management was excused and overlooked by senior leaders and HR personnel. Little training and high expectations were the norm. I would never recommend this company as a place to work. Several other coworkers (including myself) have had to be placed on medication in order to function day-to-day on this job due to stress. The only benefit to working at Coach was the sales on product. However, discounted purses and shoes will never compensate for my declining health. It just isn't worth it! Now that I no longer work there, I have not been on any medication and my health is starting to improve."
bad,"I would have loved my job here, however management was poor and did not provide adequate working conditions.  There were many unethical things that occurred during my employment here. I did attempt to reach out to higher management numerous times and nothing was ever done. I feel there is no accountability held for current management and they are allowed to provide an unethical environment. I hope that investigations can be done into what is occurring at some of your stores as It is not a good environment for anyone to be subjected to."
bad,"Coach profits greatly for themselves due to high pricing and wages that are not enough to live. (talk a look at their profit statements) Christmas was the only day the store is closed. The greed boggles my mind! What happened to 'family'? On Thanksgiving, we have to work because of  Black Friday. Another lie on 'great pricing' that people fall for making it necessary for us to work on a day that we should be with our families! I had to work from 4:00 on Thanksgiving until 1 a.m. --which means I missed dinner with my family due to my hour commute and need to be there at dinner. The profits are staggering that Coach makes! And they treat their people so badly in regards to pay! If people with lots of money actually think others can live off of $13. an hour-go try it! "
bad,"Poor management "
bad,"My time at coach was a terrible experience. Coach can be a great company, they have a great heritage. My experience working there could have been better as I enjoyed my duties of selling, however coach management is terrible. The Manager and the Assistant Manager have been in there positions for over 10 years. They feel as though they have the right to ridicule you, speak down on you, and are unfair to the rest of the employees in the store. This is why they have high turnover rate. I lasted 3 months in my position and I just couldn't take it anymore. They run the store like a boot camp. They judge customers before walking in the store based on their appearance and judge building relationships with the customers when selling. I am very upset that this had to be this way and I hope management changes for the better."
bad,"Coach ran my credit before they even offered me a position! I was looking for a specific pay rates and certain hours weekly before I would even except a position yet they ran my credit and called my current employer before I even excepted a job offer. I love my job now and was just casually exploring other options to see what was out there. I was not going to leave unless specific things were offered, which I stated in the face to face interview. I did not want them to call my current employer especially when they couldn't offer me what I was looking for. I was not happy with the interviewing experience. I also received a letter from one of the credit reporting site, saying Coach pulled a hard inquiry on my credit another thing I was unaware that they would be doing. I was fine with them looking at my background after they offered me a position but I did not know that it included pulling a hard credit report, especially if we did not come to terms of any employment.  Overall very disappointed."
bad,The managers are rude and they don’t care about their employees. They have their favorites. They don’t even like for you to ask them anything. And if they do answer it’s always a rude response.
bad,"It really was a great place to work. I love the products, the sales team, the way the store worked, and the people I worked with but there was an incident that made me immediately quit."
bad,What a complete and utter disappointment to work hard for a company for so many years and to be treated as a disposable pawn in their pathetic attempt at remaining relevant in the industry. Coach has put their own selfish initiatives above the employees resulting in an environment of distrust.
bad,Very good company to intern for. Gained great experience. Employees seemed to enjoy working for Coach and were all very helpful and friendly.
bad,"The management there had no consideration for your personal life. I was told that even though my shift was over and the next shift was present, I could not go home to my new born. The management are rude and very self-righteous. All I can say is Thank Goodness it was a holiday position."
bad,"A typical day at work was doing all go backs that people didnt like, I had to stock them back on the shelfs. Also answering the phone, helping people with pricing. Replenishing the store with product. And always have a smile on my face."
bad,"Beautiful new office; job mobility very disappointing; error prone employees; selfish boss, indecisive culture; employees seem to take no responsibility or ownership for fear of being thrown under the boss; everyone I meet complains of their bag's straps breaking.."
bad,"Coach is a very selfish company to work for. No one cares about the staff or anything really as long as money is being made. The higher up managers are selfish and are never to be seen, and the supervisors are shockingly bad at their jobs which affects the shop floor team. Countless complaints made and nothing done about them because no one cares since the shop takes money. It is such a tiring job and physically demanding and it really takes its toll on your body and mind. Avoid working here if you want to remain a happy positive person"
bad,"Management lacks communication A LOT!!! They play favorites, and are always watching every little thing you do. They are always looking for the wrong things you do and make sure to pull you aside and tell you in front of customers and coworkers, instead of telling you how to improve it. Very stressful because of how toxic management can be. Expect you to know things you were never told in the first place. As for the favorites, if it were you or one of management's favorites to get in trouble, it's going to be you. I love the job itself, it's just that management absolutely sucks. I really would not recommend working here! Just please, don't do it. I promise you there are other stores in the outlets that would have a better working environment and that would actually support their employees. Also if you work here, Coach has to be 24/7, meaning that we have to be flexible with management, but they can't be flexible with the employees. They will not work with you if you have another job, school, a LIFE, you have to be available 24/7 for them."
bad,"I tolerated the environment for 9 months. They were more worried about “the look” of the employees than how well they did. Employee input and feedback is overlooked. The pay was minimal. The benefits were not great. Discounts were not good either. I thought I was getting in on a great company, it was the worst job I ever had."
bad,great company but terrible management team. You got a lot of manager in the store and the manager will gossip about other coworkers. The most enjoyable part is helping the customers what they want.
bad,"They don't like to pay you,  for your 2 weeks of work. "
bad,"I love the brand and the product, especially since I purchased my first handbag and matching wallet in 2000. However, work life balance was not there."
bad,Management sucked! I would cashier at times and management would legit come up to you and point out something so little in front of the customers it was embarrassing. They don't care if you're pregnant either and need to go to the bathroom often they make you wait or complain.
bad,Very extressed  job enviromment  at this particular location. there is not room for any kind of mistakes. if you are late clocking in for just a minute randomly you will get a write up. there is not benefits for part- time associates and everyone have to work weekend and holidays. very hard to grow here!!!
bad,When I first started working there everyone was so sweet and down to earth but as I stayed longer I realized the management is a mess and how they run things is very biased
bad,"Worked for Thanksgiving and Christmas seasons.  I was a top sales associate of jewelry, handbags, and accessories."
bad,Fast pace work place with production always standing and walking lifting what feels like 50 lbs. I learned that it's bad on my knees and feet. U rarely saw any managers unless it's really busy or someone was getting sent home which was often. I didn't know much about my co-workers just their facial features cause u weren't aloud to talk and because there was always someone different. The hardest part of the job was making sure u made production so u wouldn't have to be sent home til further notice. The most enjoyable part was prepping boxes making money and break which gave my feet a break
bad,Only care about sales. Myst use their vocabulary and cookie cutter sales pitch. I was terminated while in the hospital recovering from surgery via email even though I had doc notation and
bad,Very very stressful! That all you need to know!! They show favoritism toward senior employees. You are not informed about all benifits that you are entitled to. Very unprofessional environment. I never work anywhere like this ever. Managers talk to employees like they are on the streets. I can go on and on.
bad,"Worked here for a short time. Was excited to work for coach . Weekly my shifts were cancelled. The expectations to remember all the products names and colour names was unrealistic after working 3 hours a week. Also your supposed to remember how many pockets each purse has and what the hardware is called. All for minimum wage! Lots of pressure to sell."
bad,"nothing good to say exception for the discount every floor change with new bags coming in.  "
bad,"I would not recommend working at Coach. No chance to have a life outside of work. Management gossip and have favorites. As a professional, I quickly realized that this was not a place for me."
bad,The teamwork and synergy was phenomenal and always got tasks done way ahead of time but nothing was never enough for management. Did not feel appreciated.
bad,"The company as a whole is ok, management at the particular store I worked at was very demeaning and incompetent as far as their jobs. They are very harassing and all have a condescending attitude. They think that anyone of color don't have common sense which I have learned from them that common sense is not that common"
bad,Empresa apagada poco aimada. Aprendí a usar el fax a cojer llamadas internacionales y nacionales.
bad,"Management was careless"
bad,this job was fun while it lasted but the environment was not open to new ideas or better ways of doing things
bad,"It was pretty commonly accepted between the associates that the store manager didn't seem to push towards teaching newcomers, and that especially put a lot of stress on the assistant/associate managers. A typical workday feels pretty stiff as far as the atmosphere. I learned a lot about the inner workings of retail/outlet stores, how to market to customers, and I improved my interpersonal skills. Management was here and there since there was only one manager besides the main store manager that was with the branch for a long time, and every other manager would only be there for a short amount of time. That affected the flow of management a considerable amount. Workplace culture was pretty awkward because there'd always be gossip between the associates. The hardest part of the job was trying to maintain a consistent personal workflow. I really enjoyed talking with some of the associates there new and old, as well as hearing stories from various customers."
bad,"Management, work life is not so great, the rules do not apply when you are not a full time empliyee... example.. bonuses. Do not go to you unless you are a fulltime employee. Which is absolute bs.is benefits not great."
bad,"Although the company provided full-time hours and sometimes overtime availability, the work put in was not worth the pay.  At the height of the business's popularity it was almost too hectic to keep up with the demands of the customers.  Under-staffing in certain areas of the company was difficult to stay organized the way it was expected.  It was always about the numbers at the end of the day.  Management was hit or miss depending what shift you were working.  However there were several people who worked alongside of me that made the day tolerable."
bad,"no advancement opportunities or job security, the compensation is ok for a retail position but not the best."
bad,"Pay is above what many other retailers offer, but the company definitely tries to milk a disproportionate amount of productivity from employees. Raises are hard to come by outside of the standard miniscule end-of-year raise, and management is very dishonest with individual employees regarding compensation within the business. Management are all spin-doctors for the company, and Coach is a huge spin-zone in general. Customer is more valuable than employees, and management will refuse to do anything that may upset them. Utter lack of transparency within the business, associates are on a need-to-know basis regarding business workings beyond their immediate job requirements. Wage increases/promotions heavily weighted toward associates popular with management. Little/no tangible reward for taking on additional responsibility within the business."
bad,"My first day I was just thrown onto the floor with no training at all. I didn't even get an orientation. The dress code was so strict, all the girls and even the guys were all caddy and rude to one another. Wouldn't recommend to anyone"
bad,Management is horrible and has no respect for employees. A typical day at work is management telling you what you are doing wrong.
bad,I dint like the company they didnt treat their employers with respect.
bad,"They claim you should have a work life balance but it really is non-existent. Don't bother calling HR if you get harassed because they don't follow up even with evidence. No longer offer raises. "
bad,Super strict work environment. Do not promote from within.
bad,management will work you to death and want to know where your at at all times. late night floor set ups and early morning shifts to set up as well. short 15 min breaks
bad,"Worked at a part-time job at a coach factory store. A typical day of work begins with a huddle, then you stay on the sales floor and make sure to greet customers and assist customers to find their needs, then you clean up and restock at the end of the day. Co-workers are usually friendly. No health benefits for part time, limited hours, hard to advance if you do not fit into the corporate culture."
bad,"Fast-paced work environment, which really tires you out. Few opportunities for advancement. Needed better structure but is a decent job for people still in school. Provides good hours."
bad,This was my first time in luxury retail. I learned a lot about this industry.
bad,No work/life balance.  management is out for themselves.  great products but no consistency.
bad,Managed several business aligned technology teams
bad,If your career focus in only on money this is the place for you.
bad,"great pay weekly but very long hours, gets very tiring, back hurting and stressful but most importantly the pay was good and that is about  it. people were also friendly."
bad,I was a part-time retail sales associate for over two years. The job was fantastic up until the holidays. The job became unbearably competitive and felt like it was commission-based. You get written up for not making sales goals that sometimes feel impossible. They encourage the job to be fun- which it can be- but it is near impossible when you are competing for a sale. The company does not promote from within. There is a lack of consistency in the stores as well. Only a great job if you are very confident in sales.
bad,"It was fun I got this job through a temp agency the pay was okay at the time, it was a very hot warehouse walking all night on hard floors pushing a heavy cart I guess its an idea job for a teen to earn money while in school"
bad,"I was accused of things that I did not do, and the team made it difficult for new employees to mold into their system. There were pros and cons to working at/with coach; majority of them being cons, unfortunately."
bad,"fast paced lots of customers from all over the world come in everyday. Since it is fast paced, you learn how to manage your time and stay organized as well as dong a quality job"
bad,"My experience at coach was a good one. I got to experience a variety of management styles. Learning about the product care and training all of our associates was a great tool to have, when selling to a customer."
bad,"the culture there is weasel your way to the top. all politics and who you are cool with. absolutely nothing to do with how hard you actually work. cheating and stealing sales is ok and overlooked if you are a top seller. management would do it as well. as long as you had good numbers, you were untouchable. would not recommend unless you are ok with stepping over anyone to get to the top."
bad,Coach warehouse was a place were you unstuff purse and  send off purse by the numbers of order to a location to be ship and handle to the buyer at the door by the order
good,No consistency in policy and it makes it difficult to work for a company that is struggling to comp.They do not award their top associates well and expect a lot for little to no compensation
good,i like the hours. But it was a Temp. Position. did not learn much. warehouse work. short breaks.
good,Cool people to meet new people and learned a lot more about purses and the different types of people coming into the store but retail is not for me personally
good,For this to be an  upscale store.  I find the Store which I worked to police and profile our customers.  The Store Manager is rude to all Employees and  it shows in the atmosphere. Hardest part of the Job was dealing with personal insults from the store Manager.  The best part of the job was selling product which was truly  worth buying.  The  customers were delightful to  deal with
good,"This is not an exciting place to work"
good,"The pay was above minimum wage, but was not a living wage. The “team share” levels were/are very unfair to those who work very hard while they are at work."
good,"When they changed the designer as well as several corporate executives, things in stores changed as well. I worked there for over 13 years dedicated my life, and they did not hesitate to lay me off, illuminate my position."
good,"First of all; If you enjoy the retail industry then you may disagree with what I list as cons.  Also, if you enjoy shopping this may not be the best place to work if you have poor impulse control and like nice things.  "
good,"dealing with no english speaking customers, put under alot of pressure and stress because of management, management team is very poor, they make everything stressful and are rude.There are good days when we all get along fine with no drama no stress"
good,Don't feel like writing a review because everything I have already clicked on is pretty self explanatory. It pretty much does all the explaining I need it to.
good,"With excitement to start work with such an amazing company. That was founded on a family’s hard work of craftsmanship. To now have it ran without a care for teamwork, management, or sympathy for employees as locations close."
good,"The product is fantastic"
good,"Working at Coach you'll have a pleasant clientele. There is very minimal work that has to be done, you pretty much just sell the product. Management is unprofessional, they create drama to for a ""more competitive atmosphere."" You'll spend most of you time standing around because the traffic is usually very slow, yes even when the rest of the mall is busy."
good,Lets talk about a company thats lost for a moment. A company that seems so put together but is really held together with scotch tape. This company awful and their culture is terrible!!
good,A typical day at work consisted of driving passengers from pick up to destination.  The management tries very hard make sure we have every thing before the trips.  The culture is unique definitely ..
good,Enjoyed the challenges of becoming the top sales to reconfirm my sales drive. The challenge was the commute to and from work. The most memorable experience was to see my name on top of the charts.
good,"A great luxury brand to work, but you have to be very flexible to get with the brand. Hours may drop from 0 and can go to 37 hours within a week without you knowing."
good,"I worked at Coach for over 10 years. I started out as a seasonal associate and worked my way up. I held positions as a cashier, stock associate, and sales associate and was then promoted to Assistant Manager, then Acting Associate Manager. Throughout the first 6 years I worked at Coach, I truly enjoyed my job. The people I worked with were great, the customer were friendly and fun, and management was fair and dedicated. During the last few years thought, things changed in a negative way. Our store manager decided to leave the company and recruited half of our staff while lying to us about it. We were left with a skeletal crew that was overworked and underpaid. The new store manager that was hired was not equip to handle out store at all. She was used to coming to work and having the rest of her team do all of the work and that is not how our store had run previously nor were were staffed to have her come in every day and just sit in the stock room. My happiness plummeted and I was bringing my stress from work home which was affecting my relationship with my brand new husband. It is hard enough working in retail and not having a strong work-life balance, but when you are doing your bosses job day in and day out, it starts to take a toll on you. I ended up deciding to leave Coach without another job lined up because I was that unhappy. If you had asked me 3 years ago if I would recommend Coach, I would give you a resounding yes. Ask me that same question today, and I would tell you absolutely not. The company itself did treat their employees pretty well. Our benefits were amazing,"
good,"Very professional culture (despite the casual dress code) and high expectations... not the most fun place to work. It does offer some perks though, like summer Fridays and considerable employee discount."
good,Learned a lot! The most enjoyable part of the work place is looking at new products to sell to the customers!
good,work starts at 6:45a.m.
good,They don't give you hours after a couple weeks of working. They said they were hiring for a full time position but they don't give you enough hours to get benefits.  Also there is no way to advance.
good,Still deciding on this job but it gets depressing with the lack of communication and sad look on everyone's faces everyday. training needs to be better and the management is just terrible no motivations to help the team or celebrate when they reach the goals or go beyond the goals instead the team have to stay at work to help the other departments with little to no training in that area
good,"Difficult culture, particularly in North America Wholesale "
good,The job was temporary. It’s a very fast pace work environment. The manger was real cool. He was very down to earth. He rewarded us with breakfast out of his own pocket.
good,Nice office space but neighborhood is desolate with no food or shopping options during break. Office is far walking distance from transportation. Good employee discount.
good,I worked there as seasonal help..I got everything half off which isn't good if you love their products!
good,The job is fairly decent however the fact that its temporary tends to make you uneasy. Im looking for something more stable for my family.
good,While the people hired are generally well mannered and friendly the overall lack of clear roles and responsibilities becomes a burden and unnecessary source of stress.
good,"just okay, somewhat of a shark tank work environment but its not commission...good for early to mid level retail workers. no movement so i wouldnt advise senior leveled people to work here"
good,No room at all for growth. Pay is iffy. Flexible schedule. No room for gaining more hours. Always learning something new about the products. Beautiful store layout.
good,"This is a good place to start if you need experience in a selling environment but do not expect to be compensated worthwhile for exceeding expectations. This store is run by a manipulative team who continuously lose talent by fostering a negative environment. Unrealistic expectations, poor pay, and gaslighting. Please save yourself and do not apply at this location."
good,Some managers are not consistent and treat associates differently. There is way Too much competition among associates who are on the selling floor. Managers need to be consistent.
good,"Join if you’re looking for 2nd job only - pay is too low to live on. Great store, great merchandise, customers are generally pleasant to work with. Asian sales staff should expect solid job security because large % of sales are from Tour buses of Asian customers."
good,working at coach was a fun experience but like any job it was also stressful. things there are constantly changing and people come and go. the managers for the most part were friendly and the associates were decently reliable. overall it was a good job.
good,"Never a dull moment..."
good,"Company always growing and innovating. "
good,"Overall a fun workplace, but there is not a lot of room to grow unless you are already in a management position. All employees are part time unless you are a manager."
good,"I am not particular interested in fashion, but I took this job right after college because I had too.  However, it was a great learning experience for me.  I was able to learn about corporate culture and how to work within the organization.  I also learned about the manufacturing industry and how products are developed through design, tested and then mass produced."
good,"Time to suit up and get ready to sell to these awesome people from  not only our community but other counties as well."
good,Good company friendly. Has Sample sales. No room for advancement mangement could be better.
good,"The company was good but unable to statisfy the needs, eariler it was beneficial but due to change in the name of coaching and plce, it lost its value."
good,This job is great for seasonal work and part time or temp work. Salary pay is very good for a seasonal job or part time or job . Would recommend this job for seasonal work
good,"As the years passed things have definitely declined the work hours, raises, and management help. Where I work at Cabazon this is happening the company is amazing they really help the employees out but it depends on the store one is in. When I started working here I loved my job as it’s gone by I still love my job but it’s become different how management is running the Cabazon store."
good,I worked for 8hrs straight everyday. If the store manager doesn’t like you then she will be mean to you. Show you what they want you know then get mad when you dont know certain things. Wants you to be doing something & not standing around yet the managers jusg stand around. They are just too strict on everything i had purple hair & if i wanted the job i had to dye it a natural color. Don’t recommend working here.
good,"I absolutely LOVE the brand! However, for it not being a commission based environment it certainly can feel like one at times. The teams are held to other standards and expectations that create competition on the sales floor which can make it feel commission; this was surprising to me."
good,"Underpaid, stressful. But I learned a lot about the way they do their purchasing orders, shipments, planning and logistics. My co-workers were friendly and willing to help."
good,"As retail sales goes, it was a pretty easy job.  Differentiated from full-price store as a factory outlet store.  Higher volume, higher traffic.  Company extended a holiday seasonal discount promotion beyond a year, I assume because sales were not as projected for a long time."
good,The pay is well and the benefits are great. Even though it is a Corp job the warehouse and management is run like a very tight family. If you are out with one supervisor you are out with all of them. If you go to HR confidently they will not keep the information confidential which makes the environment difficult to work in.
good,"The basic salary is good but the commision is poor. The management in Coach is friendly but not good enough since they just listen but not action even many staffs complained the same problem and they know the root of problem. "
good,"Enjoyable part of work is meeting new people&making them happy. I learn something new everyday. management could be better, basic pay for nonbasic job"
good,"Work can differ, when its not holiday season or midday its usually dead. I've learned alot about coach product, quality and their competitors. Management will always treat you like a child that they're trying to school. They have a hard time crediting your accomplishments because chances are retail management wasn't their first career choice. Some food for thought. My co-workers are actually now the reason why it makes it an unenjoyable work environment. They're usually around their early 20s, they think they know it all and can be very cold and stand-offish. All they talk about is buying more expensive simply because we work in a brand name store. I cant stand it. hardest part of the job is the unrealistic goals they set for you and the pressure of looking at this job as if it is our career path. i enjoy the discount, the pay rate, and the guaranteed break time."
good,"Great company that has a very strong culture of providing feedback and helping to make things better, but management does not act on the feedback given about what customers want or what competition is doing that is making Coach fall behind in sales."
good,"To work here you must be very driven and fashion forward while still fitting into ""the box""."
good,"I would clock in five minutes ahead of time because anytime after that would be considered late. Then I would obtain supplies for my job which included a pen, two large trash bags, a box cutter, etc. I would then start my job in the Package Removal department which included removing all of the excess packaging around the Coach products in the box then replacing the Coach product back into the box and keeping track of the number of items I did by the end of the day, basically meeting a quota each day. I worked at a table with 3 other coworkers, they were all focused on meeting their numbers so we did not talk much. The hardest part of the job was standing up for long periods of time without being able to lean or sit. The most enjoyable part of the job were the breaks."
good,For a large corporate company that greatly benefits from its employees it does not show much gratitude. There is a large turnover rate of employees because its a stressful thankless environment. Although there are many promises of advancement there is very little follow through.
good,This job can be a bit overwhelming if you are not familiar with the product and it's compeditors. The customers tend to be more high maintenance so strong cutomer service skills are a must.
good,"The perceptions given of the brand is there would be an elevated experience. Other than the requirement of a uniform and high personal hygiene standards, theres no difference between other luxury brands"
good,Great place to work! I had a lot of fun and met some really cool people! The purses were beautiful and I learned exactly what goes into making the coach brand so special!
good,"There isn’t anything special about this job, the pay is barely above minimum wage while they require a lot from you as an employee. They have wardrobe requirements that change all the time. There is no clear, official training process, you learn on the job pretty much by trial and error. There is no individual commission, but they offer occasional bonuses if the team as a store reaches certain sales goals, and they distribute it to each employee based on hours worked. They are pretty flexible with requesting days off as long as you give them enough notice. They do offer employee discounts but often the store sale matches it anyway. Management is okay but inconsistent. I would recommend actively avoiding drama amongst coworkers because it seems to have been a problem since before I was hired. If you absolutely need a job, this will do fine. As far as a fulfilling, well paying job with opportunity for career advancements, this isn’t exactly what you’re looking for. "
good,"typical retail"
good,"coach is a great company to work for. pay is good, time off is good if your allowed to take it. Discounts are great and lots of people ask for your insight because its a world wide brand."
good,It was like a second family. We all help each other out when needed.A good place to learn different ways of selling. And a good discount on what we purchase.
good,Hours vary based on employment status. Worked well with my college life. Hard to advance. You have to be able to handle multiple positions and be able to deal with all kinds of people.
good,"Long hours, I hated closing it always took forever. Pay was decent, sometimes with employees I felt like I was in school."
good,Coach is a highly creative and innovative brand.  It has grown toward understanding it's brand as a lifestyle.  Highly collaborative and driven employees.
good,they are very strict on being late and missing days and also its very hard to get hired on. They also work off production being high if not you will be fired eventually.
good,Had a great time working for coach. i grow a lot as a personal and learned quite a bit about myself in terms of what I'm capable of. goals were easy to meet and incentives were always up for grabs. frequent changes in store associates and management made it unstable. but overall nice experience. excellent company.
good,Drudgery trying to get the information needed to do your job.  Managers who don't bother to show up to important meetings and later are incensed about people not being on the same page. If you lack personality and feel you need someone to tell you how to dress and stand this could be your dream job. Negative experience!
good,"Overall, good experience with company just a bad store manager. Love the customer. They love and know the brand. Constant change which is good. Good partnership with district manager as well."
good,"Good company, good people, excellent growth opportunities for the team outside of IS."
good,Coach used to be a great place to work 5 years ago. Today with the poor company performance and managements attitude towards employees I would stay away. The company has a small Technology department where everyone is like family but more and more family members are getting cut each day to satisfy wall street and increase top executive bonuses. If you want to move forward with you career this place is not for you. Avoid at all costs. This company may even get sold within the next 2-5 years. Each and every quarter for the last 2 years they have lost more and more money.
good,"Decent place to work. Management used a lot of favoritism. Bad management. My first three years were awesome, once new management came in whole store changed for the worse."
good,"* work pressure"
good,"wish it was able to have been longer."
good,My typical work day was a little hectic because it was during the holiday season. My co-workers were very supportive in helping me learn the ropes. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the customers so excited about their purchases.
good,"A savoir que le rythme de travail est très fatiguant et stressant vue le grand nombre de clientèle chinoises , il faut toujours garder a l esprit qu il y a les autres clients que ce soit la clientèle locale , touristique amérique nord sud et europe et qu avec ces derniers la demande est plus exigeante,  passionnante,  rythme plus detendu et permet de réel échanges humains."
good,"Fast paced, not a lot of career advancement. Enjoyable culture and people. Improvement needed in work life balance. Overall good company that is making changes to luxury"
good,Coach offers advancement within the company and also provides an excellent platform for clienteling and utilizing styling principles to sell luxury goods
good,I worked here to stock items in the month of November for Black Friday. It was very stressful with customers fighting and coworkers were extremely competitive for sales.
good,"you meet new customers and make conversations and make friends, i like retail because you get to talk to different people from different countries. and you get to know what they like and what they are shopping for."
good,"There are only three roles that are available. You can either work as a cashier, sales associate, or a stock associate. Over the past years I have worked here, there is a disconnection between upper management and retail employees. Work and life balance was hard sometimes due to long hours. Compensation for the time I've worked here felt I was underpaid and over worked."
good,"Coach is an overall very nice place to be employed, the discount is very reasonable and is perfect when it comes down to gifting for the holidays. In my experience I have had several managers within the store that were all amazing and the work culture really embraces the brand and supports its employees for career advancement."
good,"Although technically a luxury brand its still a pretty standard retail job. Some stores have both stock and sales roles, but the smaller stores may have you doing both. My store was around 5-8 people, at some points we were down to 3 and were borrowing from other stores but the atmosphere is pretty good, and usually light, and the discount is amazing. You need to have at least some interest in fashion to work here."
good,"Crowded environment, could be better. Better understanding superiors. Great pay and benefits. 1-10 management 6. Environment 4"
good,"The place was very busy and hectic all the time. All the other managers were in a little clique, so it was all about kissing as much butt as you could. Very shady SM and GM... they only cared about the numbers and not their employees. It's a great starter job but don't stay, dealing with a popularity contest every day."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of several customers coming in, and one of us trying to claim them as our customer for the sales. If it was holiday season, we all ran around trying to keep all of our customers along with keeping the store organized and the phone answered."
good,Coach is a good company to work for. They offer fair compensation and a great bonus/benefit program. The customers are fun to work with. There is the pressure of secret shoppers but as long as you do your job youre fine.
good,"Was very excited to get this job and my co-workers were very welcoming, nice, and helpful. Management was very mixed up and do not pay attention to their employees. When I had a death in my family I told one manager for the day off which she approved and when I came back I got in trouble from another manager. Then when I had to move I wanted to transfer to another store they kept pushing me aside like I was not important and kept giving me the run around or they were too busy so I had to move to a different state without a job even though I worked hard, stayed late, and came into work on my days off. Also they pay was not great but even though I went through that I still miss my job and my co-workers."
good,"I am responsible for gathering evidence for trademark opposition and performing legal research on various issues of U.S. and international trademark and copyright law. I am also responsible for drafting DMCA notices, which are then sent to individual websites and/or their corresponding hosting companies and registries for copyright and trademark infringement. Also, I am occasionally required to complete ACPA and UDRP actions, where I compile lists of domains and target cyber squatters that use the Coach, Inc. trade name in their domain name."
good,"business was fairly slow"
good,Coach culture is very focused on company growth and building cross functional partners.
good,"I have been working for Coach factory for about six years now. I absolutely love my job and helping customers find the perfect bag and accessories. I strive to make all the customers leave with a pleasant experience and provide the best customer service possible! I have built a clientele throughout the years and my customers have become a part of my family. I've learned patience and perseverance, and not to take anything personal. I absolutely love my co- workers because we work as a team and each person brings a positive attribute to the working environment. I personally think the management team should hire within. I feel that there are a lot of great people with a lot of potential who go unnoticed and have worked for the company for many years. Every person should be treated fair and equally."
good,"The store is small and have 4 managers, to many for the size of the store, they are to pushy and strict with the uniforms, the zones and schedules the on call thing is the worst you can not make plans or work in another place, manager have to relax is just retail and a small store... Instead of encouraging us ended up dissapointing us... There is no commission but still we have a daily amount wich force us to annoy customer follow them everywhere... They go to buy a purse not to tell us the story of their life's and families and make friends... There is a thin line between servicing and pestering... Too stressful for the amount they pay ( minimum wage)"
good,The discount wss great. Didn't like getting off early management would walk the aisles and say a time you would be leaving and if u didn't hear to bad. Favoritism played a big role as well.
good,"its a warehouse I learned how to stand on my feet for periods of time"
good,"The Company does a good job communicating about changes or decisions that affect employees."
good,My overall review is pretty good other than some of the managers are too much about themselves and they talk at instead of to customers and employees.
good,I worked at Coach through a Temp Agency. It was an alright job. I had no complaints at all. I don't know about the benefits because I was a Temp worker. I would refer a friend to work there.
good,"Coach is classic and I strongly believe that they do stick behind their brand, because their quality is phenomenal. But as far as being one of their employees, it varies. The reason why it varies is because it depends on the leadership above you. I believe that leadership is a reflection of how your team will turn out. And after working on both sides of the fence, I've had many ups and downs. I grew a lot as a leader and learned a lot about myself that I did not expect. I would say the hardest part of the job is moving up, because they prefer to promote within. And the most enjoyable part of the job is the employee discount."
good,"coach allows me to continue my studies and works with my school schedule , and still gives me great hours. however the job itself can be stressful at times."
good,"Working for coach was amazing, with the brand name, its history and its business global standing. With regular hours rotational shift (not 9-5 job) . Some Co workers are good and supportive, however some can be aggressive with sales( its not commission based, so what more if it is) However there are a lot of struggles working for this brand (probably not all location) less work force more work load, less managers more responisbility, lazy manager gives employees the reason not to care for the job. Unprofesional stuff, too much drama within store"
good,Have to learn to adapt different managers but overall a wonderful working environment. Times can get difficult due to lack of communications between management but in general it's been a pleasure working with the team.
good,"its a very competitive environment, cut-throat if you don't have the right people behind you.  The discounts are good and benefits as well. Management are fake and phony. I learned never to work in retail"
good,I worked at Coach for 7 years and 7 months. I enjoyed most of that time. With a few minor improvements and flexibility I would stay with the company until I retired.
good,"Working with Coach Inc is a very good place for training. Colleagues, team leaders and management itself are quite cooperative and helpful. The company provides proper training and exposure to a fast paced environment. The company molds and helps employees to build a career and success in their chosen field.You can grow in this company but it takes patience and technical know how to achieve the same."
good,You register item on a rf scanner place them in their correct box and send them down the conveyor belt. You walk a lot. Your feet will start to ache.
good,"I enjoyed my time working for Coach and worked on different teams over the years. The work/life balance really depends on your boss and team as each department is managed differently. "
good,"Very corporate environment. Great for a first job out of college. Hard to advance, and lots of red tape to go through to get anything done."
good,"I enjoy working at this job. My co-workers are very friendly and welcoming. Although overwhelming at times, the customers are easy to work with and are often very friendly. I wish I was able to get more hours and had benefits like sick days and personal time."
good,A typical day at work involves a lot of hard work for my peers as a stock associate. Management is very shady and secretive. The most enjoyable part is when I go home.
good,Not a Hard job at all but it requires a lot of walking and its a lot of noise Lunch breaks go by really fast Most of the full time workers are pretty nice but the pay is not that good
good,Coach is good at providing sales and product knowledge training to sales people on a regular basis. You can also at least 40% off discount on almost everything.
good,"Working at Coach is very welcoming. It isn't very hard, however the customers that shop for this company are more difficult than other places I've worked."
good,"This is the busiest and most profitable store in the world.  Hours are long and very hard.  Selling the product sold its self pretty much.  Very easy job in regards to selling.  "
good,"The pace at the store was very slow.  Once customers came in, however it did allow you to spend quality time with them to ensure they are given all the features and benefits of the products to make an informed buying decision.  The product is expensive so it was important to make sure the customers had all the information they needed to feel comfortable with their purchase."
good,"Extreme favoritism shown towards associates. Little training/instruction with extremely high sales/performance demands. As part-time it was decent, but would not stay long-term. Great pay, though."
good,"Great place to work with good benifits, advancement was difficult based on the fact upper management was not going anywhere."
good,provided work for co-workers and removed package from product.
good,"This job is not healthy for a family. The company is great but, you have no time for yourself or to spend time. It is not sympathetic to personal or family lives."
good,Great designs with even better price tags! Loved meeting tourists from around the globe at this location and knowing they will be arriving home with a great leather good from this company.
good,"It's push push push from managers.  It's all about sales and very little about team development.  It's retail, that's all I have to say."
good,"Great customer service, friendly working environment."
good,"Acquired and learned a great skill set as well as befriend great customers and coworkers. However, it is not lucrative and very hard to advance. There is very little communication to upper management and lack in compassion for employees who work hard."
good,"Due to varied level of customer activity within the building, Coach provides excellent training and use of Client Building strategies to increase sales and Associate productivity."
good,"This is a production based job. Great people, but a lot of different personalities. If you can't meet your quota that's not the job for you."
good,"Work with many different customers helping them with there needs. Learned different ways to sell. Management works well with employees, but not with each other. Co-workers worked well as a team."
good,"Coach likes being Coach, and doing what they want to do.  They are not open to employees offering suggestions of improvements, change, or whistle blowers."
good,"Very high paced environment.  Hands on customer-employee relations.  A huge target market consisting of international customers from over seas.  Management oversees the whole store, while still completing operational duties (scheduling, self and staff development).  The management staff is the most enjoyable part of the job.  It's great working with individuals that share the same drive as yourself.  The more difficult part of the job are the language barriers we encounter with our international customers."
good,"Working in retail at the Woodbury Commons has taught me valuable things about customer interactions and the importance of polite, well mannered salesmanship. Since Coach is one of the top two busiest stores in the mall, Monday-Sunday is constantly mobbed with tourists and New Yorkers alike. A typical 8 hour shift consists of me ringing about 30 customers an hour. During a rare time when the line is short, my job duties include stocking the back with product, assisting on the floor, assisting with bagging for other cashiers, and making sure the cash wrap looks neat and tidy. My job includes interacting with many different managers and maintaining a healthy work environment. The hardest part of the job is also the most enjoyable. We rarely have time to take a break from the constant barrage of customers. This, however, makes the day zip by and helps keep me focused."
good,Typical corporation working environment. Not recommend if you prefer family-like office.
good,Coach is a start to luxury. They go out of their way to help customers. Take in all the knowledge and move forward.
good,Very customer service driven. Poor communication between management teams
good,a typical day would involve loading and unloading trucks. i learned how to be productive at a really high level. my co-workers worker were very fun to work with. my job was easy to do once i got the hang of it. my most enjoyabl part was getting off after putting in long hours
good,"It's a fast paced environment and you never know what your next call is going to be. You have team players that are willing to assist you when needed. The peak season, after Thanksgiving going into the Christmas season, is the highlight. Very busy."
good,It was a seasonal job but I was later asked to stay on as part-time. I loved working with the customers and displaying the purses.
good,A fun work environment with great peers and sometimes really great customers. Very high-paced with a lot of goals put into place. The management though is incredibly incompetent and do no treat their employees with much respect. Rarely promote from within unless you're a favorite.
good,was a basic productive process .
good,Daily activities and co-workers are enjoyable. Work load lite and easy.
good,it was good pay for that job. i managed teams of 10 or more people. i handled problems with the employees. co-workers were friendly. there was no hard parts.free to walk around.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of a traffic of customers. Coach is a very fast-paced environment which requires a close attention to detail, not only with appearance but with operations as well. I oversaw many operations behind the cashwrap. I made sure that all cashiers were properly trained and displayed effeciency in service and operations. The management team consisted of 12 people, this had to be the hardest part of the job. There were too many inconsistencies between the management team, which unfortunately reflected upon other associates. The most enjoyable part of the job was watching the team operate fast and efficiently while still maintaining the customer service aspect of the job which we cherished dearly."
good,I would not work there again unless its my last resort.... long hours with short breaks and no one really communicates with you making the workplace akward and quiet
good,"I like my job. I just wish I had more hours and benefits. So if you are looking to be full time, you better hope you get a management position. The people that I work with are great. Although, I do not understand the fighting over customers. That is something that makes me a little irritated being that we are all supposed to be working together as a team. The Managers are wonderful! The best part of my job is meeting new people, especially the ones that come from around the world. I have learned so much about handbags and how to overcome objections. I have even been able to learn more about management and I am thinking about becoming apart of the management team, but I have not made a sound decision yet."
good,This was a wonderful place to work while I was home from school in college. The people were great and the discount wasn't so bad either.
good,Was working at coach for 3to4 months and it was ok I was unloading off of a conveyer line and I was moved to another position vr scanning boxes it was ok
good,"It was fun to learn what was the inspiration behind each creation of Stuart Vevers. It was helpful to translate that to your selling. Be wary of management stealing sales. Stay with your customer 100%. From Hello, to sale of product, to goodbye. They have to make their numbers too in order not to get written up. I have seen many ugly things happen because of this."
good,Amazing team dedicated to providing exceptional customer service. Fast paced environment with an educated team ready to find the perfect item for you.
good,Company has changed throughout the years. The best part of working for Coach is the people and the clients. The work life balanced has changed and training and developing has lost its way.
good,I have no comment at this time about coach. Its a good job if you need to work while you or in school. They will work around your school schedule.
good,Enjoyed working at Coach and its a fantastic company. Was sad to have to leave the company. The majority of my coworkers were a blast to work with and we had a great time.
good,"At Coach, they really do try to help you make your sales goal. They even help you fill out your goal sheets. Unlike department stores, they are realistic about sales goals."
good,the pay is great esp for young people but the employers/managers were annoying. always watching you always on your back. just very annoying
good,I would come into work and make sure everything was there for a smooth and comfortable work day. I learned to be work oriented and motivated while making a few friends on the way. the hardest part of the job was was standing up the whole time for the 12 hour shift.
good,The responsibilities and managing a team was an incredible experience- the growth within the company was promising but in the end the culture and the values did not align with my own
good,"No workflow process, worst environment, no proper recongnition, unnecessary repititive work."
good,Working at the outlet mall is very tiring. Customers are rude and pushy. Management is not very good at managing
good,"Well like with all retail jobs. The company is always worried about the business and not so much about the workers. With that said Coach has been okay to me with working with my schedule, but the company has definitely gone down since I started with the company. Management is always cycling through and at times they are cool but most of the time they are annoying."
good,"As a Sales Associate at Coach, the days can be long and very boring, since the flow of traffic is not consistent. Still we are expected to stand like near statues ready to pounce on the first customer who comes through the door. At times I feel as though the management is not totally aware of just how hard many of the associates work to please and appease customers. The hardest part of the job is meeting sales goals, which are often unattainable based on the low traffic. We are expected to ask customers 'life style questions', i.e. what do you typically carry in your bag, who are you shopping for, anything to get more information about the customer. Frankly, I find this a bit intrusive and try to read how far I can go with my engagement with a customer. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing the satisfaction on a customer's face when they are genuinely happy for my help, and leave the store sincerely thanking me. It is a good feeling. For the most part I have come to look forward to seeing many of my co-workers, who have become friends on different levels. I have learned a lot about myself by servicing a broad range of customers - I am good at reading people, assessing what may be the best tactic and suggestion for them. I have learned a lot about conversion rates, sales per hour and units per hours and how these metrics affect the business as a whole."
good,"Sales can be rough if the clientele isn't available to sell to, but when there are people to sell to, it can be really rewarding. The benefits and pay are fair."
good,"●	Adjusted employee floor coverage based on daily, monthly and yearly sales."
good,"Over all good company to work for, great leader ship in place. No much movement for advancement. Great program with training, great with focused on people..."
good,I had such a hard time with Coach connect they lack as a company in this area. Coach connect does not support you. They are suppose to be there for you but when something in your life happens they are not  accommodating even though you have been there for the company. I have certain benefits met the criteria but gave me a hard time for my own benefits. I didn't like that feeling or lack of communication.
good,Fast-paced.  Small teams allow for high-interaction but more workload.  Quick reaction to sales needed or opportunities are missed.
good,"Coach has a strong culture with some great leaders.  Brand is rejuvenating, although still a good amount of work to do.  HR/Talent team is relatively strong however lost some great leaders recently."
good,I had a great experience the short time i work for the company. I was able to learn how to operate a electric pallet jack while i was there
good,"In the world of retail sales I do not find too many positive things to say. Perhaps that is just me, but even though I have worked in retail it has never seemed a good fit."
good,"I worked at coach as a seasonal employee. I took the job during the holidays for extra cash. I already had a very good job so I didn't accept a permanent position. The pay was excellent, and it was weekly which is a plus. The benefits that were offered to the permanent employee's were not offered to me because I was only temporary, but I do know that they were awesome benefits for a retail job. Co-workers were mostly nice, but at the end of the day you have to have a level head to work with a bunch of strong minded girls. Remember that it is a job, and not high school and you'll be fine.Just always remain professional. The hardest part of the job was I think because it was a brand new store even as I came on board the specific Coach that I was employed by hadn't even been open for six months at that point, and there was a lot of employee's and about six active managers so it wasn't the most organized place at times. One manager would tell you one thing, and another would tell you to do something else, and at times I just felt like they might have been over staffed and didn't have much to do with all the seasonal workers. Mostly though it was a nice experience. "
good,"The everyday duties was opening and closing the store, training and giving feedback back to the associates to make them the best that they can be, computer tasks with windows and excel, and inventory. the area that ""I excelled in and was promoted in was visual."
good,Company has greatly changed. Not proud anymore to say I worked there. Used to have best in class people and all are gone now. No one I know who is left is happy there anymore.
good,Overall great culture. There was never a stable lead in management and hence a lack of associate development. Lack of growth opportunity within the company.
good,"The location I worked at was an outdoor mall, during the winter is was dreadfully slow. Making the very long and hard to reach sales goals. This was my first retail job, so I learn a lot. Just about everything you need to know about retail. There was a long period of time that we did not have a store manager, this made a chaotic work environment. I enjoyed the customer satisfaction the most, then of course the discount."
good,"a lot of change in leadership and policy         "
good,Working in a modern luxury and high pace environment of bicester village can be too much to certain people. Management is helpful and friendly if you hit target you will be rewarded.
good,"part job, average 10-20 hour per week "
good,"Coach is a really good coach, I had great time working for them. It was my first recruiting job. I learned a lot because they have great program and training classes for there team members."
good,The time I spend at toys R us taught me that even the little ones deserve to be treated with respect and extreme care. the time I spend there really showed me how much holidays mean to kids. its a great place to work if one is looking to have fun and entertain the customer.
good,"Although this was not the perfect fit for me, I learned a ton and enjoyed my time here.  I left for a better personal fit.  Great for start of career..."
good,"Working at Coach brings you great satisfaction in helping customers find exactly what they need for themselves and for gift giving purposes. There are also regulars, who come in and almost feel like family. The staff members on multiple levels (store front, management etc.) are quite close, and when in need of assistance, help is only a call or text away."
good,They start you off with good pay and great discounts. You also get paid weekly which is a plus which is hard to find nowadays. Everyone was easy to work with and worked as a team. I also love Coach purses so the discounts really helped. Also the managers was fair and awesome.
good,Great place to work. Staff very friendly. Facility is air conditioned and always clean.  Love the people and the hours.  Typical day is very very busy
good,Coach is a fast paced environment where you can gain experience in the retail world. Working with customers one on one and creating a memorable experience is a must to succeeding with this company.
good,Great place to interact with employees and customers. Fun environment and fast paced with environment being relaxed but focused on customer care.
good,Well it started great but as the year went by. Things got more difficult drama was happening all around me. I want to work in a professional place where I feel safe and welcome.
good,"It was a part time, seasonal job so no benefits, or job security. Management was great except at times were to hawkish. The day would usually begin with me coming in around the time things picked up. (about 3pm) I would get a ""minute"" which is a update to let you know what is going on. Then several customers would come through and I would be either at the cashier or waiting to greet them at the door. Towards the end of the day we would clean up and While a manager was in front, I was in the back getting the store ready for closing. The hardest part of the job was stocking all of our inventory. We had shoes, all types of bags, coats, and little household items. The best part was getting a sale and knowing that the customer was satisfied with their purchase and wanted to return. Overall great work place, friendly co-workers."
good,"A typical day working at Coach is productive. There's alot to do not only trying to sell al purse. You have shipment that comes every tuesday and thursday, you have found orders that needs to be packaged up and set out, and you have clientrack this is where you reach out to your customers to check on them to see how there hangbag is holding up for them or to invite them in for a bag cleaning service or to tell them about a sale's event we have going on. The hardest part of my job is trying to get customers in to check out the new handbags we've brought out and set up an appointment with them, most customers are always busy so they don't like giving a time to come in knowing they will not be able to make it . I've learned so much by working at Coach, the background, the craftsmanship, and modern luxury of hosting."
good,"Great company, customer service is always a priority and new product is alwyas up to date on trends. work life balance is great depending on your store manager."
good,"Regularity & Punctuality"
good,Coach is a nice work place. I liked the daily huddles it kept the store very organized. Goals for the day were set so we knew what needed to be done. Management always knew what was going on because they communicated well.
good,"In general, Coach is a good place to work. But some mid level management leaders are horrible. zero respect to team members, very talented people are treated like horse."
good,"Partnered with Store Manager in the daily operations, business strategies as well as selling techniques that contributed to the overall financial results for the company."
good,"Great product, benefits and perks, but the culture is lacking.  Hard work and dedication isn't enough for growth opportunities.  The politics of the culture gets in the way of career growth."
good,Working at Coach through remedy though the pay is good and some hours as good as well more could be done. Better benefits would be better for holidays.
good,"Easy place to work but no advancement and you are stuck in the same place, hard to go anywhere further in the job because there is no upper positions besides manager to go up to. Very focused on modern luxury and the dress code is strict and you have to wear all black and there is no room for your own creativity in your style. but its not a hard job and would recommend to work there if you are looking for something in retail."
good,"Of course in all fashion jobs it's about what you look like and not what you know.., you don't necessarily have to be a top producer to advance.. just be beautiful and you can advance all the way to district manager . Probably why they had to close 4 stores.. Great job for young people that's trying to learn something about fashion."
good,I worked with some really great people.  Had the pleasure of being part of a team work environment.  I learned how to interact in a professional manner with a variety of customers.  I am very grateful for the experience.
good,I worked at Coach as an independent contractor. It was a great experience and the location is gorgeous as their now in a new building! The work was tedious and could've been challenging but overall I enjoyed my team.
good,"great company.  stock plan, and great management meetings.  Developed a lot of great skills.  Good management mentors.  outside of the box thinking is encouraged."
good,Fun Workplace just doesn't pay as well. But the most enjoyable part was where I got a chance to work with special needs kids and the ones that needs assistance in leaning new things and exploring.
good,"When I worked there, I enjoyed the people that weren't management more than those who were. Management seemed to always be power hungry. The only people who benefitted from that were themselves."
good,"Time Flew when the store was busy, good pay at 15 an hour."
good,"I was volunteering, it was not an actual job. I went only on the weekends, and when I went on the weekends I only was there for 3 hours then I went to my high school team practice."
good,"fast paced but smooth coverage is decent and always something to do you don't get bored or you never have to say ""there is nothing to do"" . some times short off stock people and stock checks get crazy but customers are sometimes understanding"
good,Coach is a company that continues to set themselves up for the future by establishing a model of acquisition that will allow them for many years of growth to set them up as a strong global company.
good,"Great work environment, great people to work with. Rebuilding brand with a big future. Hard to move up in, but overall a great place to learn the industry."
good,"recent company restructure, more than 10% of staff laied off in search of new venture. A lot of sr leadership was effected but there was changes across the entire organization and on a global scale"
good,"Fun, small workplace where you work closely with your fellow colleagues. Being a team player is a must which is good. Each colleague has sale goals that need to be reached each month and management does a good job of giving you tools on how to reach those goals. A typical day at work would be to open the store and to ensure that the sales floor was in pristine condition for customers to see the displays in good taste. Management provided product knowledge on new items that arrived into the store prior to the actual arrival so that we would be prepared as soon as they hit the sales floor. The most enjoyable part of the job was closely working with my  co-workers and working together towards and exceeding our sales goals each month."
good,the company truly care about the employees. They make sure you Work right and work happy. I have learned a lot since I work for Coach. I recommend this company to everyone.
good,It was crazy how your numbers at the end of the day would get you fired if you didn't meet a certain level. Didn't expect it to be like that.  It was a alright job to work.
good,"Working at coach is a mixture of intense knowledge and characteristics of similar yet different products and high social skills in order to provide a good shopping experience that assists the customers in what they want, while not being overbearing."
good,You need to know how to communicate with your customers like they are your friend and try to get to know them. I learned a lot about what the customers think about coach's bags and why they have been loyal to us for so many years. The workers there is always a pleasure to work with I made a lot of friends there. The hardest part about working there was you always had to look like you are busy and the most enjoyable part of the job was I got to hear interesting stories about random peoples life as a cashier and I got some people to smile before they left the door.
good,work environment ok but can be aggressive and competitive at times...pay is pretty much minimum but team incentive program is ok......................
good,"most of the time it's a good environment to work in unless you don't get a long with the managers or your coworkers. pay is low for the customers you have to deal with on a daily basis. very strict on the way you dress, hair, nails, and the way you present yourself."
good,Coach is a fun place to work with excellent retail training.  Not always easy to obtain a management position for long time employees. Some times there is a disconnect between corporate employees and the retail stores.
good,"If you like purses and fine Coach product, and even if you don't, you might love working here! You become really close to your coworkers but some of them will end up hating you if you do well. It's a very competitive environment so roll up your sleeves cause you'll be selling REAL HARD. The managers don't let you breathe, you must ALWAYS be talking to a customer or else you get bitched at."
good,Company is going through lots of changes internally and externally and everyone is required to put in extra effort to make the company succeed. New management.
good,Liked working at Coach but was only part time and got another full time job. Enjoyed the benefits and discounts with the company.
good,Fast paced selling environment. Great benefits and compensation package. Good Work Life Balance. Medical Benefits were very reasonable
good,"My time at Coach has been incredible. I've been able to see the company go through massive changes in size, leadership, and popularity. Its products, history, and culture will always remain the same though. I'm happy to have been a part of the team."
good,Coach retail is very sales driven lots of unrealistic goals. Non fashion forward uniforms which is very odd seeing that Coach is trying to be a very high end brand !
good,"Cada día tenia un reto profesional diferente, lo que hacia mucho más enriquecedor el trabajo con el grupo."
good,"Every day at Coach is different. Being a store manager requires the wearing of many hats, from customer service to HR. I enjoyed all the diverse tasks that were part of my job."
good,fun team to be apart of and can grow with the company. good benefits. Usually busy everyday. Extremely busy every weekend. Great sales. it gets really crowded inside the store and sometimes have to start a line outside to keep things in control.
good,I really enjoyed working with this company.  The people were great and the work was exciting.  The only part I didn't like were the hours sometimes.  But you have to expect that working in retail.  My manager worked with me which I cannot complain.  She was very helpful.
good,"work environment was not bad at all, busy lifestyle working in San Francisco but I enjoyed it. Learned a lot about managment. My favorite part of the job was definitely my co-workers. My least favorite part was when it was really slow at work."
good,I loved working here. The only problems I had at Coach was that it was leaving. It was not a permanent store. I did stay til the end.
good,It was good. I was there for a while and I enjoyed it. It was in a clean environment and it gave me lots of experience in a warehouse environment.
good,I had a great experience working for Coach.  The culture and employees made it an awesome work environment. I would welcome the opportunity to go back.
good,Typical Day at the coach office starts at 9am and ends for me around &-8pm. The early bird catches the worm. They have restructured and are going after a different clientele. Love the new merchandise and its great.
good,I worked under the district manager during holiday and gained more visual merchandising knowledge with Coach. Willing to work for the company full time if a position opened up.
good,"I find out what our day goal is, and where we are at that goal. I process our shipment, place the product were it is needed weather it is on the sales floor or in the back stockroom. Communicate with customers on the floor and also on the phone. Replenish the  slaes floor with product as needed. I have learned how to better communicate with customers and employees. How to maximize the look of the sales floor with product and visually with props. One of the hardest parts of the job is that the hours are not set, they do change weekly. Working with other employees is what is the most enjoyable about this job, also we are able to get monthly bonus."
good,My typical day at work is me working on shipment in the back room and retrieving merchandise for customers. What I've learned from the job is all the different types leathers that are used to produce the product. I love my management team and co-workers. the hardest part about the job would be the scheduling between another job. what i enjoy most about my job is that i get to work for a company that i have always wanted to work for.
good,"My typical day revolves around managing my sales force and maintaining all aspects of the stores functions.  Those include but are not limited to visual, sales and service, and operations.  I learned better ways to manage time and increase sales.  The best part of my day included helping customers find merchandise that is suitable for their lifestyle and maintaining proper operations within the store.  The hardest part of the job is maintaining a home and work life balance."
good,"It was a lot of fun working at Coach.  My co workers were a pleasure to work with, everyone got a long great with everyone.  Sometimes I was in the back wrapping bags and bringing them to their corresponding owner.  Sometimes I would be on the sales floor selling bags to customers."
good,"Three years ago Coach was an amazing place to work with fantastic leadership but they are going through some growing pains right now. They have had a few rounds of downsizing and now have extremely lean teams across all departments company wide. Coach will fight through this tough time and will come out a stronger company than ever. That said, it might be smart to wait until the dust settles before joining the Coach Corporate team."
good,Low pay. Not a lot of good things I have to say about my experience with Coach so I wont say anything except it wasn't for me.
good,Working at coach was a different experience for me. Having to talk to customers locate certain items over the phone. Having to search up the item to see which location has a certain bag. I had good co workers that help me get through a shift. The pay rate was good for a seasonal position
good,"chance to upgrade him self"
good,"I worked with a team of sales associates who all got along. Halfway through my employment we had a change in management, and I found the new manager of the store to be very unprofessional. On numerous occasions I was singled out in front of other store employees. I left the company to pursue other career opportunities."
good,It is a very fun workplace. The staff gets along very well. Management is always there for you.
good,Working at Coach can be a lot of fun. I really enjoyed assisting men and woman shop.
good,they pay extremely well for a seasonal position and you can pick your availability for the most part.
good,"Checking in, process, and censor, all new merchandise. Inventory and audit. Floor-sets, Lighting and fixtures."
good,"Coach became hard to work for once they were running coupons everyday and the product became cheap. This was at an outlet location, the customer base changed drastically also."
good,Great place to work. A lot of incredibly talented people to learn from.
good,Coach was a great place to work in college. I could apply what I was learning in the classroom to my retail job. Our team was more like a family.
good,"Either your looking to work in a great upbeat environment or something part-time to enjoy the discounts that come with it, this is the company to work with"
good,it was fairly easy but it was not much communication going on so the work day seemed long. The hardest part of the job was locating certain clothing. My co-workers were for the most part polite but some remind me of high schoolers.
good,Great customer service. Great Company Values. Great tools and support.
good,"A fast paced job that will be difficult at first from all the memorization of purses and items, once passed that it becomes manageable. It is very busy as there are at times 70+ people working at once. The management tries very hard to be on top of everyone but sometimes it falls short just because of the sheer amount of workers at any given time. If you like Coach products, you and your family will enjoy you working there as the discounts are great."
good,They train their employees very well. I am proud I got a lot of my customer service expertise from this company.
good,There's always lots to do. Sometimes customers are difficult.
good,"as an employee of the coach store, everyday i was given a set of instructions to unload, unpack, and restock store with merchandise. sometimes i was required to work out on the sales floor and inform customers about merchandise and also offered my personal opinion"
good,Overall Coach is a great company to work for! You must be hard working and dedicated to have a career at Coach and you must be willing to give up the idea of having a work life balance.
good,Everyone knows everything about everyone. They treat their employees as if they dont matter and are replaceable.
good,"Fun experienc very different enjoyed. would return, fun. nice people great customers"
good,An amazing place to gain the experience you need for customer service. It was a busy environment with some challenges but possible to overcome.
good,I enjoyed the communication skills I learned. No commissions made it a more enjoyable work environment.
good,"As a Coach employee, you learn to interact with customers on a very different level in comparison to a typical retail store. Most days were hectic due to the sheer volume of our store. In my management position, I learned to efficiently tailor my coaching style to each employee. My co-workers were difficult at times. Too many managers without enough direction can result in a poor example for the associates. The most enjoyable part of the job was having the ability to always put the customer first."
good,Good values. Well run company. Great discount. Very customer service driven. Great place to learn and grow.
good,"Coach is a very popular company with a new shipment of merchandise every month. The atmosphere of this job is busy, but enlightening. The employees are extremely fun to work with and helpful to those new on the job. Management is strict and holds high expectations, but only to hold the standards of being a Coach employee."
good,"Wonderful colleagues, fashion and fun."
good,Specially on the holidays season there’s so many orders to pick/pack and there’s overtime almost every single day and week. It’s like you don’t have any time off for yourself and you’re working all the time.
good,"Coach is a great company, it can be frustrating at times, there’s not many opportunities to move up within the company. Management could be Improved like many other places."
good,"The workplace was equipped with ping pong table, carum board etc. Also had a prayer room. Offered massage to reward and relax. Friday was a dress down day"
good,Coach was a nice environment.  There is a lot of pressure to meet your goals or you will get written up.The store gets reset every month.  Sometimes there are transfers going on at the same time you are receiving in new merchandise which creates gridlock in the stock room.
good,You had a sale goal each day . Achieving this goal can be very stressful. You had to be aware the cut throat sale people. The customer were great to work with.
good,I have been employed with coach for 10 plus years the pay for warehouse Associates or not competitive with other companies in the area the breaks for warehouse Associates are not the same as customer service an upper management you only get 30 minutes lunch break and they get an hour. For the most part the people there are Pleasant to work with but you do have some management and team leads that just won't listen and want to have things their way. Coach needs to come out of the box and look at a pay increase for the associates
good,"working for coach is a learning experience i work both shift the morning is an okay shift to work but working through a temp service they would really treat us any kind of way they would come to use during our shift and tell we had to go home and to return tomorrow but send us a messages saying we no longer had an job there to call the temp service for more work the workers for coach would treat us like we just the ""help"""
good,"A typical day at Coach Inc. consisted on arriving to the store, opening up registers, checking emails and completing paperwork; while at Coach I was the visual merchandise manager; my responsibilities consisted on making sure that the sales floor was full with the correct merchandise and also making sure that shipment and the warehouse were organized and appropriate for other employees to find what they needed and that the store was presentable when higher ups came to visit the store; as the visual merchandise manager I was in charged of creating floor plans following a basic guideline sent by corporate; merchandise on the guideline wasn't always available for our store and that is where imagination and creativity would come into play; management wasn't always on the same page and it appeared like some managers had more responsibility than others making it hard to prioritize and assigns tasks to other managers; the hardest part of my job was working Holidays; most of the time as a manager I was away from home for special Holidays such as Thanksgiving, Christmas Eve, New Years, Mother's Day, Father's Day, Easter, etc; the most enjoyable part of this job was getting to know people from everywhere in the world; there were customers that would come from China, Japan, Vietnam, Colombia, Brazil, etc. just to purchase at our store and that felt somehow rewarding."
good,"It's a fun place to work and they care for their employees, you always have work to do, not much down time, good for anyone looking to be active and for organized people"
good,"No consistency, I've worked at all over the Coach store location throughout Manhattan and they are not consistent with each other. Each store manager has there own agenda and does most do not follow company standard."
good,"It was an ok experience. Work was easier then I imagined, The Shipping department was always busy sending orders out. Management was pretty cool and understanding. Co-workers were focused on getting the packages put on trailers, dedicated to the job. The hardest part was lifting the heaviest boxes and putting them on belts. The most enjoyable part of the day was reading my daily productivity."
good,"Very knowledgeable & friendly co worker."
good,"never dull always busy, meet lots of great people. LOVE the product!!! working shift work was my biggest problem having small kids."
good,Fun setting to work in but not much room for movement upwards
good,"I am looking to move on from my apartment, as I would really like to work in Men's Fashion"
good,"operational tasks assigned are broken down as- to two hour blocks mon-fri. "
good,"My time at Coach, Inc. was a great learning experience. I received a lot of training in customer service and sales techniques. These are skills that I have taken with me into every job I've had."
good,"A typical day at Coach consists of managing my personal address book through clienteling using emails and phone calls to drive business. I assist clients with their needs and I am with them throughout the entire transaction. When handling multiple customers my management team is there to assist me. They are there to motivate and are always pushing to do better. "
good,It is a good company. They are extremely organized. The company pays attention to detail. They care about their employees and communicate well. They focus on productivity and their bonus structure and incentive programs are great. This is a company that focuses on customer service. Making your goals are sometimes a challenge. The employees are professional and outgoing. Making plan and building relationships with the clients are the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,"I worked at least 50-55 hours a week. I did two hour closings at least 3 days a week. I covered every manager that called out. I was one of the most reliable Associate Manager. I was completely flexible. Some days I worked from opening to close. I managed about 50 associates. My associates always followed my lead and were hard working and dedicated. The hardest part of the job was putting my daughter 2nd to the job, and being as flexible no matter what. The enjoyable part of the job was helping the store make a profit by utilizing my leadership skills. Keeping the associate happy and motivated through every obstacle that came our way."
good,im a good worker and do my job with a 100% mind set. it was a great job the only thing is that it was seasonal and i'm always on time to work.
good,"Pay was okay for a part time retail position. Not enough to live off unless you are high upper management (general manager). Bonuses received was nice, but how much and to who could improve. Fast paced and fun if you like keeping busy and active."
good,"Great place to work for but wish got more hours. Started off with great hours, pay and benefits but now hours are getting cut for payroll and now it’s basically nothing."
good,"To much work for just 1 person, but sometimes 3 people together doing nothing, the sock manager isnt good worker, and sometimes he is ""nice"" and others is like an ""ogre"""
good,This is definitely the place to be if you are competitive and don't mind the hustle. This is Coach Oulet so don't be confused by the Retail store. They are different.
good,"Overall experience of working at Coach was great! It typically depends on the location and the management at a particular store. Everyday, there was a new challenge or objective that must be met, whether it involved customer service or sales. The hardest part was making sure all customer's were attended to without being overly pushy."
good,"Coach helped me learn and grow my skills needed for other jobs. I found my self transferring my skills to my other job, when it came to customer service."
good,The company has strong values and a desire to continue moving forward in the fashion and business culture. Coach takes pride in giving consumers what they want and are always looking for further feedback.
good,"Coach strictly enforces their sales goals for associates and repercussions are administered for employees that fail to adhere to their goals. However, excellent bonus opportunities are offered for those that exceed/meet goals."
good,"Everyday was different.  I improved on my partnering skills.   If working on a special project, it was to my advantage to have a positive working relationship with many of my partners"
good,"The discount is great and so is the management. However, the pay rates are not what you would expect from such a huge company. They are huge about the customer experience and dedicate most of their efforts into training. You must make your goal or there are consequences."
good,"Coach Inc. taught me a lot, and has helped me grow in the sales industry. With that said, my work life balance is what made me decide to change paths."
good,It was an average place to work at. You had to keep up with sales and had to dress to impress. You had to wear name brand clothes but if you could not afford them then you would in trouble in a way.
good,"Love my Bellevue team workers. "
good,"Daily tasks included linings up customers,  helping futile customers on the sales floor."
good,This job taught me time management and improved my organizational skills. Working closely with management on tasks gave me the opportunity to express opinions and get feedback on my overall performance.
good,"They advertise that they promote within the company but they don't. I worked there for a long time and was M.I.T when I left. They had me train the next manager when I was up for the promotion. Yes, I am bitter about that but that's besides the point, But hey, if you have the experience to start off on the management team, go for it. However, if you are looking for long-term and want to move up within the company, this isn't the job for you."
good,"A typical day at Coach outlet deals with a high volume of customers. Us associates learned how to communicate effectively in order to provide excellent customer service to keep up with the fast pace milieu. With management support, we are able to stay on track of the responsibilities we have daily. The most challenging part of the job is communicating with foreign customers with language other than English. On the bright side, it also interest me to learn new language which means new ability to further improve my communication skills."
good,"Pros: No two days are the same. There are always new and exciting projects coming up. My co-workers are some of the brightest people I know. I've been lucky to have had good managers during my tenure here; people I can learn from in a professional as well as in a personal capacity. "
good,"My work at Coach was a typical day to day retail experience. Management was okay, but sometimes they were too social and too laid back. My co-workers were super nice. It was almost like a close knit family. "
good,"The benefits are good, nice discounts, great management, and the team is like a big family. Coach is becoming a lifestyle brand, and can't wait to see where it goes. Engaged co-workers and flexible schedules make summers rewarding."
good,"Great place to work. Easy to advance from Assistant Manager to Associate Manager, but very hard to move up to Store Manager position internally."
good,"A typical day at work started at 4:15 and sometimes did not end till 3am. I learned that time management was the most important part of this job, which is also the hardest part because of all the rushes that needed to be out by a certain time. Management was able to help me hone in on some of my skills I know have, but the most enjoyable part was my team mates."
good,"Nice work environment"
good,I have had the pleasure to be a consultant for Coach in 2010 and again presently. The company is great my only wish would be for it to be more stable to hire permanent employees.
good,"co-workers and managers are very friendly"
good,"Usually good managers, occasionally they hire and restructure into a terrible system."
good,"I have always been fortunate to enjoy going to work everyday. When I first became a store manager for Coach , we were the only store in town. In just short of five years we accomplished a 40% increase in sales! ( First year up 48% over the previous year.)   Motivation , and Great Customer Service played a  huge role."
good,Great company that is willing to advance their employees to the next level while providing many learning and development classes. The environment is very diverse which makes it that more interesting. The most enjoyable part is learning and evolving my career.
good,"A typical day at work for me would usually begin with me clocking in, then checking to see what position I would be in charge of that day. Next, would include me fulfilling my duties such as making sales on the sales, organizing the merchandise, and assisting the customers as well as possible."
good,"Typically my role involved developing a strategy for the day and coaching the team for individual improvement. I was also responsible for the behind the scene operations of the store and involved in training another manager in the role of Visuals (floorset, responding to sell through). I was a driver in customer service, I helped develop contests and tools to drive our sales and motivate our team to achieve certain metrics."
good,"I greeted Customers and advised them of daily sales,replenished Stock to floor as needed and strived to attain daily sales goals. I learned that having daily goals kept the associates more alert and on top of making sure the customers were satisfied. Management was very to the point. My co-workers were all hard workers and alert and ready. The hardest part about the job was making sure to always make your daily goals. The most enjoyable part of the job was when you did make your goals and you were rewarded."
good,Management are positive and encouraging. Employees seem happy. All staff seem to believe in products they sell. Good communication about new products and promotions.
good,"It was a new experience, there were good and bad reviews at this coach. some of the management was amazing and helpful well others were more on the moody side. overall a great experience even got to learn a bit of mandarin."
good,"Aperturas"
good,It was a seasonal job. It’s sad that some managers and employees think they’re too boujee just cause they work at Coach. Some will straight give you attitude for no reason and make you feel like you don’t know what you’re doing when you do. It’s a simple job. Other than that great pay & some employees were really cool.
good,"It a really fun workplace. The brand is amazing. Some managers are very friendly."
good,very segmented but collaborative environment to work. Management is fair and new hudson yard office space hasopen layout. though I left prior to move.
good,I would recommend working at Coach as a great stepping stone for those who need help gaining excellent customer service skills.  This is the job that has prepared me for more success.
good,"Good place for experience, the management team is amazing, working as a team is one of the main focus. They encourage the employee to meet their goals."
good,"Coach hires quality candidates that they can grow and develop over a long period of time. They look for employees who are willing to learn and can stay within the company for the long term. A typical day at Coach can involve any number of things from assisting customers on the floor in a modern luxury way to processing shipment in the stockroom. Each individual location operates slightly different, of course, but what remains consistent amongst all of the buildings is the strong level of teamwork. Management teams for the most part are fair and understanding, willing to educate and teach junior members of the team. The hardest part of the job, as with any retail job, is having to stand for long periods of time and dealing with a range of customers who may not always be friendly or polite. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to work with different kinds of people and forming strong bonds and camaraderie with coworkers."
good,"The culture of the store was molded around the idea of a becoming a leader in the fashion industry, which caused such bizarre choices of style that we were forced to learn to pass along to the customers."
good,"You deal with a lot of resellers in the Carlsbad location, great staff, .  They are a great company with good benefits. If you like handbags this is the place for you."
good,Coach has a great team of leaders that ensure business runs smoothly at all times. Having worked there for more than two years it became a beacon for learning how to run a sales driven team.
good,"retail stores are taken way more serious than outlets. Do not treat employees as well as competing brands like Michael Kors or Tory Burch. pay is above minimum wage, but can be challenging to move up."
good,Loved work in a team selling environment.  I grew professionally and got lots of confidence building clientele relationships.  I was able to develop a group of sales associates to increase sales and prevent operational losses.
good,Fun workplace but wasn't given proper training. Some co-workers were friendly and others were not. Management was nice. I loved help customers pick out their next purse.
good,"Great place to work during the summer. Decent pay (for a retail job), and it's a clean job. The only thing I didn't like was using mobile devices to check out. They require us to use them but they clearly make the customers uncomfortable. They think that we are scanning their credit cards on our phones. Overall great place to work."
good,Great retail company to work for. Visual merchandising for this company is always fun and challenging. Company focuses on developing employees so they grow within the company.
good,Pay was decent for an undergrad student.  Advancement opportunities weren't in abundance.  Management was great! My immediate supervisor was the best!  The hardest part of the job was standing for prolonged periods of time.  The team was fun and supportive!
good,In the Repair department we processed repair request by physically evaluating items and sending them for repair or to be returned to the customer. Responsible for making hardware repairs in house. Operated reach trucks and pallet equipment to store product and pull pallets.
good,I get to work clean the sales floor for about one to two hours. I check our client list for any phone calls that I need to make. When the store opens I stay available for customers whether they need to complete their transactions or find a specific item. When other cashiers are on the floor I assist them with any problems they might have the best that I can.
good,Coach is a world class organization which has had tremendous growth the past 10+ years.  They've made significant investments in infrastructure and continually look to innovate and improve.  It's a terrific company for ambitious people.
good,"My day is always different, I love that. "
good,"The employee benefits were awesome. "
good,"I loved the company but that was my last straw for retail. All those hours on my feet, made me realize how much i loved and needed to be in an office setting. Coach did teach me everything I know today about customer service and going above and beyond for my customers and employees."
good,a typical day at work is loud and fun. I've learned how to count a drawer in and out to take my time giving change and paying attention to customers. The managers and sales associates are always willing to help you with what ever you need. the hardest part of the day is it is the same thing everyday.
good,"This salon was a hit and miss with a crazy head boss. There was a lot of tension in the air but the girls always did a great job on hair, waxing or whatever you needed."
good,"Stores were set up for success, no projects were to be worked on during store hours. Concentration of the day was geared to customer service and building and developing customer relationships and development of team. This built customer loyalty and repeat clients, and set a standard for growth with employees. Co-workers performed as a team to accomplish goals. Company was extremely transparent with all employees and company supported employees to succeed. Communication was at the forefront of the work day. Hardest part of the job was the mandatory six day work weeks from November through January."
good,"Decent pay for associates, allows room for advancement, flexible job roles required on the job."
good,"I have learned to expand upon my extensive customer service skills, management skills, multitasking skills, and increased knowledge in HR and sales."
good,I was Stock Supervisor and was in charge of processing daily shipment also preparing and delivering the product to the customer in a timely manner while delivering exceptional customer service.
good,"I worked here for 7 years which flew by really fast. A typical day at work involves providing customer service, checking prices, finding out what the customers needs are so that you can help him/her find the right product. The store sells handbags, wallets, wristlets and many accessories. Once you become familiar with the product everything else comes pretty naturally. It can be a slow day if there are not much people shopping but during the holidays this place is like Disneyland on the weekends. There are long lines, a very crowded store, and at times difficult customers but thats in any workplace. Its a fun work environment, and flexible for college students. You work holidays and weekends because its a retail job so if you're okay with that then this is a great choice. I learned a lot about customer service and took great pride in the product. Everyone loves Coach and having that excitement from the customers about our product was always a good feeling. Management is great if you need help with a sale or questions about anything. Coworkers are just as helpful if they have good experience, its really a team environment. I wouldn't say to depend on this job as your only source of income but if you work your way up to management then its good income."
good,"Good group of people to work with, somewhat like a second family."
good,"I was typically performing Cashier duties while at work. The Coach customers were always very friendly and patient. I learned a lot about the different Coach products, which I had no knowledge of before. Some of the managers I really enjoyed, but some I was unable to make a connection with during my month there. Also, it seemed to be common to have miscommunications among the multiple managers. My co-workers were great, but there was so many of them, it was a challenge to get to know everyone. The hardest part of the job was that my shifts were always seven hours or longer. The most enjoyable part of the job was creating a fun work environment with my coworkers or being fortunate enough to provide service to happy customers."
good,A typical day at Coach is very fast paced. I was able to build upon many of my technical skills in the Windows environment while being exposed to the Networking environment.
good,I strongly believe that we can't make anything happen without team work and positive energy.
good,"A typical day consisted of laughter, smiles and a great learning experience you meet all different kinds of people and get along well with your peers everyday was a good day"
good,I started Working for coach as a stock associate and became sale associate for 10 years as sale associate I'm million dollar seller by providing my best knowledge of customer service.
good,It's fun to work there if you have the patience to work with many different staffs and customers. As like any other work place everything is fine as long as you do your own work.
good,"a typical day of work at coach consisted of clocking in. After, a manager would read you the daily which held information on the best selling bags, what the goal was for the day, and the discounts for the day. Afterwards you get to sell by talking to the customers or you get to work cashier. During the selling time, if its slow, then the manager goes over selling exercises with you."
good,"What I   really liked about coach was how every employee is coached on the COACH culture, Clienteling, and product knowledge. I   believe these 3 main skills helped me improve my skills."
good,"Started out as seasonal and ended up staying at Coach for a  few years. The Staff was great, almost everyone was able to get along and we became one big family. Every day before the start of your shift you'd get a briefing on what the quotas are for that day, sale changes and anything else they needed to talk about. Management was great always there to help out if needed, If you're trying to close a sale but the customer still is undecided they are more than happy to help you finish the sale."
good,"Working at the actual store was great, the veterans were super helpful and nice, although exclusive at times. Managers were helpful, but pretty incompetent at giving out breaks and lunches. They also did not tell me about multiple policies upon my hiring and many of the things in my new hire packet were outdated. I was not told about the allotment of 3 call out days per 6 months we were allowed before we were spoken to about absences. I also did not know that I would not receive a portion of teamshare because I had not passed the 90 day probation period, until I asked another employee why it was our second teamshare since I’d been there, and I hadn’t gotten a check. They also don’t provide any safety training whatsoever, i didn’t even know we had box cutters until i went into the stock room for shipment. I was also injured on the jobnot even two months into my employment. There weren’t any available outlets in the break room and we were not allowed to charge our phones at work because that’s “the company’s energy”. For store meetings, the company gave us a budget of $3 per person for breakfast. We had prepackaged bagels and juice from Sam’s Club, when there was a Noah’s bagels and a Starbucks and a Panera, that all cater. I’m not sure if that was a lack of money, or a lack of planning on their part. The discount was great, and it was easy to get days off. The job itself was also the easiest job I’ve ever done, and I really enjoyed it. I was sad to have to leave. It was pretty competitive for getting top 4 seller every month, and there was a lot of pressure to get more sales,"
good,Great environment with a awesome product. I was able to build relationships with clients that made it a point to come back and see me. Sales were tracke but this helped impact rasies and other incentives.
good,"Overall good. Employee discounts are good, and working environment is nice, people are helpful and patient. salary is ok, but  employee benefit is good."
good,"Good company - a bit male heavy at the top despite its heavily female workforce.  While it tries to be more family friendly, there is a sense of a boys club. I know HR will respond that it takes means to balance, and I completely agree that the company means well.  However, it is the general impression.  That said, I would highly recommend working for the company. I worked with more talented and smart people than anywhere else in the fashion & retail industry."
good,It's a great place to work at if you have a lot of time on your hands very fast pace and always something to do you work on weekends and get all over time that you need
good,"The quality of the products being offered is all worth the price. You can learn a lot of while working in there, it's a busy store. Management should strictly follow the schedule and breaktime of staff."
good,The hours were long and tedious but it was enjoyable learning about luxury goods and seeing the smile on peoples face when you bring them the item they've been searching for.
good,"During my time at Coach, a lot had changed. When I first started working there, management was great and worked diligently to make sure the employees were on top of their work without being too pushy. The work environment was great, everyone was friendly and there was no drama. When we changed to a new location, management was more strict. One of my fellow employees became a target for many tasks even though we had plenty of other employees who were doing nothing. Management played a lot of favoritism for certain employees. "
good,Working at Coach mailed me gain a lot of knowledge on proper customer service. The managers do a great job at helping their employees when they need it.
good,"Love working at coach. Even though we had a lot of work and many different tasks, the challenge and the willngness of the people around  you to help you. Made it all worth it."
good,Good place to work at if you wat a good pay for a good period of time. Heavy load of work but a great working environment. Management need some improvement though
good,"great place to work. granted i work in 2008 but at the time it had benefits, 401k etc. They treated there employees fairly an they paid great at the time"
good,"I freelanced at Coach for about 3 months, and in the beginning it was a culture shock. Once I became more acclimated, it was very fun. I learned a lot as Coach educates their designers. I was able to work the S/S '16 runway show"
good,"This is a great job if you're a student looking for real life retail experience. As a Sales Associate I was able to learn about the Coach client, and meet their shopping needs."
good,"A typical day at work for me starts with a fifteen minute meeting with the entire staff. We learn about what happened the day before and also the new goals for the present day. Then we all scatter to our sections, mine being the register. I make sure the cashwrap is all ready to go for when the customers come in. That includes making sure we have enough paper bags, tissue, gift boxes, pens, tape, etc, available for my fellow cashiers to give to our customers. Then once that is done we assist the customers with either checking out, repairs, or exchanges and returns. If the stores traffic is low for the day i go out on the floor to make sales, or go to the back to help with shipment. After two or three hours, i go on me meal which is 30 minutes long then i take an additional 15 minute break. After i come back i continue to assist the customers in any way possible as well as provide a helping hand to my managers or coworkers. The hardest part of the job has to be keeping up with the high volumes of people that come into the store. It can get very busy, so it is hard to try to help everyone in a reasonable time period. The most enjoyable park would have to be working with my coworkers because they make the job fun; also, it is very satisfying when you provide a customer with the perfect bag."
good,"Working at Coach I made some of the best friends. Everyone treated each other like family and working became fun. With fun though, there is also a time to be serious with your work duties. This job taught me a lot of responsibility as it was my first."
good,"I was a freelancer at Coach through an agency and it was great. I didn't have to stay late often but when I would leave at 6pm I would see people still walking around as if it was mid-day. A lot of the time, especially during business review (hindsight) would be ordering dinner  ahead of time because they knew they'd be there past 8pm. I heard of people staying until 11pm just to get things done."
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with people "
good,"Typical day at work involves me replacing bags, maintaing visual standards on sales floor also providing customer service.Processing shipment, doing price changes and floor sets. Also cashier if needed to. Training new associate  What i learned at coach is how to listening to customers needs and providing them with the best product that fit there needs. management could have been better in the way they speak to associate, could have done a better job at developing the talent they had in the store to move them into management. The co workers there are great and are the best part of the store they work with need associate well they never so no when needing help and keep the energy in the store high. Hardest part of the job is when you first start learning all the product and their features. the most enjoyable part of the job is when you find the perfect product for the customer and they leave happy and with a smile."
good,"I used to work for Coach Men's Factory, before we merged into one store with Coach Women's. It was a small, calm, and very enjoyable store, where I would make individual connections with all of the customers. I was witness to new and different experiences with management because they were always focused on building the team's knowledge and skills. I now work in a bigger store and faster paced environment where it is harder to connect with most of my customers in a memorable and personable way. I believe I learn nothing new, and if I do, its from my coworkers who enjoy helping their teammates, and not from management; who seem to just be there for the paycheck. I enjoy working with the customers and giving them a great service as they shop throughout the store. I believe that there is really no hard part to this job, just frustrating situations that I seem to solve myself (unless a manager is absolutely needed) because I hold a knowledge that can help myself and my coworkers throughout the day."
good,"It's great a Company to work For. "
good,great company to work at.  Provides competitive compensation and benefits
good,"I worked as seasonal sales in Coach. There is not much work to do in a day. Just talking to customers and help them to get the product they need. Co- workers are very nice. The working environment is excellent. However, the hour wage is quite low. I am not able to survive with the salary."
good,Difficult company to move up in; great in-store management
good,-Team share every month if the store reaches their sales goal
good,Shifts are not very long between 4-6 hours. You learn a lot about the product and management is very helpful. You have to keep up with the dress code which can get a little pricey but it is very tasteful.
good,"The shifts seemed to go by so slowly for a cashier. I need to keep my hands busy so I would constantly be cleaning or folding boxes or tissue paper, cutting ribbons, and making gift packages. When the Holidays came around our store would constantly be crowded. Coach's cash register and ordering system was very complex and complicated, but once you learn it things will move along faster."
good,Coach is an excellent place to grow in retail. I learned the way that a major company runs and the efficiency that you need to run a company that large.
good,"Slow work day, not much traffic in the stores. I learned lots about selling and connecting with clients. Theres 3-4 managers per store and they all are supportive and friendly. Lots of co-workers at Coach with about 15hrs per week. It does getting boring time to time and theres lots of pressure to meet goals and be constantly active on sales floor. The product is great and nice staff."
good,I am responsible for ensuring packages are located and shipped up in a timely manner. Responding to internal and external customers regarding shipments
good,"It's my first paid job, sometimes I did not do well, the manager pointed out, so I felt I'm being supervised. Work made me feel secure and I could always learn new stuff and take new challenges as well."
good,"Go in at scheduled time. Open store and inventory count. Make sure all visuals on the floor and employees' dress code are up to standard. Manage slaes floor and registers. Work on Time and Attendance(Payroll) and hand out correctives to employees if needed. Close registers at night, end of the night paper work, ensure visuals are set and ready for next morning and ensure that all doors and windows are locked for the security of the store."
good,"I love working at Coach. The environment is great, I love working with all of my co-workers and employers. The only problem is that I would like more hours and a bit more flexibility. I keep getting scheduled random tiny hours on days that I have already stated that I cannot work and THAT gets frustrating."
good,I was a seasonal worker and it was fun while it lasted. Very busy during the holiday season which made your working shift go by fast. I enjoyed working with the people.
good,It’s and established company that continues to grow.  The pay and benefits are competitive.  The people I work with are great.  But there are always drawbacks in retail environments.  If you want weekends and holidays off this is not for you.
good,"the ladies and gentlemen I worked with were very kind, the 50% off discount was also a major plus for me! the sale goals were ridiculous especially considering the location"
good,great place to work. the job culture at coach is amazing. management will work with you when there is a conflict with your schedule and shift. The other associates become like family.
good,This store was very busy many customers buying so there was always something to be. It was job where time flies. This is a great job if your going to school the company is very flexible with schedules. Also great benefits for all the employees
good,這間公司的內部結構完善，有提供員工的專業培訓，而店舖之間的互動有禮，做到款待的要求，對顧客的購買慾望，可以再加以提升
good,"Coach is probably one of the best employers I've worked for. This position is very easy to break down."
good,I was able to learn about the fashion industry and what customers are comfortable with and interested in. Was able to speak with people from all over the world. Allowed me to get great insight on how the retail industry works in terms of operations and front of house.
good,"I haven't seen the benefits yet but have heard they are great. You get benefits for being part time. Everyone is welcoming with great energy. New P.O.S. systems and have yet to get those great benefits. Everyone is a team player, no drama but can tell there might be a little jealousy. You work on Teamshare and not commission, if you make Teamshare then you bonus for the month. A lot of standing around and not much to do so when there is someone to do they will do it themselves and not show how it is done. Overall, great company with not much advancement do to nobody leaving."
good,Visual merchandising is a large part of employment there. Large management team. Flexible hours (open until 9 pm). Overall a fun and challenging work environment for those who enjoy customer service.
good,"Stalking hours we're when we usually had our downtime. Coach makes you think outside of the box, it isn't all about selling purse it is about customer service and feeling how a person feels about a specific handbag, or sunglasses, just the brand coach is amazing."
good,I loved my job at Coach! The only reason I left is that I was a single mother and it just didn't pay the bills. The pay is fair for the type of work that it is; I had just out grown the job.
good,"i worked the stock room . that was my main job. if they needed me to do a different task due to someone else not  being ale to i would work  the sales floor as well as the register. i learned patience, up selling, register, as well as a lot of different leather bags and goods. also was taught how to close a store. it was a very up beat positive vibe store . i enjoyed working their those 2 years. the hardest part of the job would have been dealing with the hard clients. the people their were the most enjoyable part."
good,I worked for Coach   for 21 years and it was a great experience. I found the company  are fair to there employee. I would recommend this company to my friends
good,Great place to work.  I love all my associates and we get along very well.  It is fast paced and has high expectations on meeting sales goals. Management is pushing more on adding more tasks that sometimes are impossible to complete in a day.
good,Plenty of opportunity to learn if one puts in efforts!
good,"during holiday seasons and most weekends Coach is a very fun and lucrative place to work. Very busy, but friendly atmosphere, opportunities for bonuses and great discounts on products!"
good,"Nice company, great benefits, great people. I like to work here, but company has lack of career advancement. Would recommend this employer to anyone.."
good,"Management is fine, no big issues. Fun working environment when it comes to coworkers. There's many working at a time, making it easy to build relationships in and out of work."
good,"Checked in all delivered merchandise, processed and stocked store...worked sales floor and customer service. Was trained in customer service monthly,"
good,nice for part time work for people in college. good discounts and management was very team appropriate. Good way to meet new outgoing people. Give it a shot.
good,The styles were easy to sell and the quality outstanding. I was able to build relationships with customers. Visual merchandising was fun every month with intro of new styles.
good,"I enjoy working at Coach and I enjoy the people I work with, it is centered around teamwork with personal incentives as well.  I dislike the slow growth and raises in this company. I have been working with Coach almost 4 years and although I've received two promotions, I have only received a 54 cent raise and I am only making 4 cents more than those just starting out are making."
good,The company provides many tools to learn about product launches and selling skills. A great company to work for. Co workers support one another and create a fun environment.
good,I enjoyed working there wish I never gave it up for driving not best paying job but I guess its comparable good benefits good people to work for
good,Coach was a great work place and I enjoyed everyday of working there a laid back.Enviorment and was a fun place to work. A typical day consisted of folding clothes stocking clothes and just a flat out incredible Enviorment for customers
good,"Great job. Due to slow traffic, most of the Coach sales team was very gossipy, but nonetheless everyone was very productive. Awesome pay, benefits, and DISCOUNT."
good,Working for the company was mostly enjoyable.  It had its challenges during certain times of the year but that just fueled the motivation of the employees.
good,a big company with many brilliant people; The work is not that challenging and you need to improve yourself~love what you do and find what you want to do~
good,"Coach did not have enough hours however the discount for working there will keep you coming back to clock in, great customers, no hard goals"
good,"I loved working in the Atlanta store, but I moved to Florida and it wasn't the same, plus I needed something full time and it was not available at the time."
good,"COACH is great place to work been there for 11 years."
good,"Great people, good culture, strong ethics. Great benefits. Strong leadership. Best part of job is leadership support and ability to learn."
good,Learned excellent customer service in fast paced store.  Managers and coworkers were great to work with.  Learned so much regarding this line of handbags.
good,"This was my first job. In the beginning I enjoyed it, but then I started to have issues with a few of the managers. Over all though it is a nice first job."
good,"I enjoy working at Coach however, I'm looking for something a little more consistent with steady hours. Overall it is great!"
good,"Coming straight of high school into the business industry was definitely a challenge for me. However, I overcame all my adversities and learn to work with people that had different personalities as me. I learned how to self-motivate to reach all the goals of the company."
good,"Excellent company to grow with when it comes to fashion."
good,"Close knit working relationships"
good,Had a blast working with smart and motivated people everyday.
good,Coach warehouse had a very consistent flow thought out a day depending on the task. Work was consistent with a task set to pay attention to detail. It made your senses sharp and accurate. Management was a little strict but not too much and understanding of the last difficulty. I learn how to check quality of materials and report the finding of default and separate merchandise
good,Coach is a great company to work for long term. The company offers great pay and benefits with a great balance between work and personal life balance.
good,The pay is decent if you aren't looking for anything serious. The discount that the company gives their employees is AMAZING! There's hardly any room for advancement even if you've worked for them for many years. They tend to be EXTREMELY picky about who they choose as a manager AND even an assistant manager.
good,"sales rep and cashier "
good,"Worked as a warehouse associate working in different areas of the warehouse; such as the vas department, put to light, picking in Ur& Ar, returns and Pr .Also help with training new associates within that department I was working in"
good,I Learned new things. The co-worker were so helpful. And the hardest part of job is to finish big Project in time and enjoyable part of the job is getting very good experience.
good,great people and great opportunities! Offers great benfits and plenty of opportunities to advance
good,"A typical day at work consist of answering phones, finding items fo customers, ringing up at $2,000.00 in merchandise at a time, dealing with upset customers who feel as though the company is wrong for not meeting their particular needs at the moment. In working a Coach, I have learned to listen with the intent of understanding. I have learned that not everyone lives by the same principles as I do and I have learned to professionally deal with that. "
good,"My training here lasted a couple of weeks. As this was a seasonal opportunity, I was able to implement the knowledge I accrued right away and enjoyed the process. Most of my time was spent either filling the stockroom with new merchandise or out on the floor selling to customers on a one-on-one basis for full optimal customer support. Management here was over-all pretty good. The only problem was with the upper management, who seemed to always be out to lunch and never in the store. Also, they did not seem to discipline unruly employees in the stock room.The most challenging part of this job was having to remember the assorted category names and sub-names for all handbags and accessories. The best part about this job was the interaction with the customers and the ability to be able to give my own suggestions with fashion advice and use my retail and merchandising experience in the process."
good,"Coach inc. Warehouse was a very nice place of employment. There was never a slow day of work in the assembly line. The company had many benefits: paychecks weekly, quarterly bonuses for all employees reaching sales goals, many employment opportunities."
good,The co-wokers were nice and informative. It is very structured and your are learning skills on a daily bases. Very great company to work for. Good employes get rewarded!
good,I learned how to multi-task very well in this position which has helped me moving forward today. I also learned that its fun to work as a team to achieve an overall sales goal than to have it be an individual goal.
good,Providing the best service to our customers is the best part of my job. I enjoy interaction and creating new relationships with diverse people.
good,"Company is good in general, management (SM and DM) has some issues. A typical day at work for PT is 9-2 or 5-9:30, just selling, straightening, shipment, etc. "
good,"Make a personal sales goal."
good,Very entertaining and energetic place. I love the clientele relationship and its productivity. Customer Service was excellent.
good,enjoyed my time at Coach. Its a great company to grow your management career with. Very smart company. 
good,We were always on our feet. There was never a dull moment with it being the holidays.
good,Always on your feet with something to do. Never bored and great management. Feels like you're on a great team to work with.
good,I learned a lot working at Coach. I learned about making a relationship with the customers before trying to get them an item.
good,Coach is a great company for career advancement. You feel like a treasured member of the family.
good,I am fortunate to work in a place where I get along with my coworker and managers. They are supportive and understanding. The job itself can be stressful at times but it is very rewarding.
good,"I've been working at Coach for about a year or so now and I have always felt welcomed and included, hours are flexible and management is always energetic and friendly. I learn things each shift and enjoy interacting and creating relationships with the clients"
good,"Great management learned plenty of tips on customer service, sales, and cash handling. Able to have conversation with co-works as long as it did not get in the way of customer service, and kept yourself busy on slow days."
good,Coach is a great environment that provides both a interactive atmosphere for both customers and clients. It is a place of business that makes you excited to come to work every day.
good,I liked working at Coach I felt like I was appreciated  for my work . Learned how to work under pressure and with different individuals with different views.
good,Working at Coach was fun and educational.  We gathered each morning to go over the day's goals and how we wanted to focus on customer service as that is the main culture at Coach to always be there for our customers and inform them of our products and to find something that would best suit their needs while always asking open-ended questions. We always worked as a team in motivating each other and giving constructive feedback.
good,"Working at Coach was fun and glamorous, but the level of available autonomy is a common complaint. The company has strict rules about appearance, presentation, and sales. If you don't mind abiding by strict rules and having to tailor your image for good benefits and pay, check Coach out."
good,Coach is a good company to work for. Between past paced and slow paced. And at least you get pretty good employee discounts and sometimes they have employee appreciation.
good,"The typical day in the Special Projects included retagging items with price changes, and marking items for the annual employee sale. Very repetitive tasks but good management."
good,"Steady, ever changing environment. Good team work. Able to balance home life and work. Good benefits which shows Coach cares about it's employees and their well being. Coach is very charitable and cares about the communities in which we live."
good,"good environment, I learned how to be a better sales person and teamwork is the most important thing.  The most enjoyable part of the job is working with other employees."
good,People are friendly and team players  There is plenty of room for advancement.  There are many classes offered for learning more about the company.  Too many emails and meetings that prevent you from getting work done.
good,"Coach is a great company. Never stop training  employees. We always have a lot to learn, to test. Also, monthly and quarterly secret shoppers. Big pressures.  Good customer service."
good,Excellent co-workers and management team. The Corporation itself would do well to start listening more to the Associates who interact directly with the clients.
good,Working at Coach was fun. Fellow co-workers were nice and fun to be around. The company invests in their employees more then other companies. Management were great except some of them can be over-bearing. Sometimes management would work as if corporate office was always watching them.
good,"Coach is always challenging itself to be its best by taking on a new approach the customer experience, hiring a new designer, and tackling social media. It was very exciting to work or a company that was going through a huge brand transformation and to see the results after so many years of hard work. Being apart of the this journey, both as a store level employee and a corporate employee, provided me with amazing experience in the ever changing retail landscape."
good,Very understanding management team. Flexible. The culture at coach is very interesting. Also have many chances to better yourself as an employee with the help of a great staff.
good,"Sale assistant is a high pressure job."
good,"Being able to interact with people from all walks of life was the highlight of each day I went into work. I learned lots of patience and understanding from individuals I considered to be life teachers. The management was not all that great, but when the appropriate effort was put in, things ran smoothly."
good,"I answered in-bound and made out-bound calls to customers to assist with orders and repairs. Typical day involved data entry, customer service and new challenges. I worked with a great group of people. The hardest part of the job was when I was unable to resolve the issue and had to refer it to management. The most enjoyable was helping customers."
good,"Management was great, customers can be the most difficult part of the job, so patience and understanding is essential for this job."
good,"Coach is truly a great company to work for. They stand behind their product and only hire great personalities, including all of the management team. The pay is a bit low but it was definitely a great option for part-time work because it was enjoyable to be at work each and every day."
good,Responsible for opening and closing counts and making sure the customers were satisfied. It was a strong organization with great supportive management. 
good,"First we would feed the kids breakfast and once they where done eating we let them have a little bit of free time to converse. Once that time was over we did workout drills, tried out a new sport and then fed them again before it was time for them to go home. My co-workers where very enthusiastic which is something that I truly appreciated about volunteering there. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that I could be making a difference in one of those kids lives."
good,Provided excellent customer service to each and every customer that walked in. Promote leather goods products to customers. Perform sequence changes on a monthly basis.
good,I am an assistant manager with requirements in the stock room and on the sales floor. I handle all shipment and inventory reports on a daily basis. I am also required to guide and train new associates as well as setting goals and expectations for existing associates. I started in sales and worked my way up to management which allowed me to see all aspects of the job from both perspectives. The hardest part of my job is maintaining our sales goals while creating a positive environment during high traffic times. Associates need feedback hourly and managers must communicate all hours of the day to achieve our goals. The most enjoyable part of my job is building a great team and utilizing/empowering associates to push their own goals.
good,"When I started at Coach, I had worked retail for 6.5 years and this was a very new environment to learn. I was brought in as an assistant manager and I was able to learn on the job with wonderful training provided by the company and felt as ease quickly and this new, fast paced store. I learned store operations and systems from the associate manager who then recommended me to be promoted to associate manager when our store manager at the time was leaving. I was also interviewed for the store manager position as well. This was a great place to work and excellent management team; at the store and district level."
good,"while working at coach for the past 7 years i have not only acquired a bunch of new friends and learning experiences. but I have found another family to learn on in times of rough and time of wealth. wonderful people there, great training, and great benefits and incentives."
good,"Every month a generous discount is offered to employees.  Store Managers attend an annual conference, great for networking and connecting.  Environment favors a group buy-in towards achieving goalss"
good,"The job here was a very formal environment, it could be incredibly fast paced during holidays or very slow during work hours on a weekday. The job itself is very sales driven and requires you to work irregular hours at times."
good,Great company to work for. They provide the tools to lead your team and be successful. Great work environment and very structured. Committed to the well being of their team members
good,The management at Coach both at a store level and corporate level was amazing. It made coming to work very enjoyable. I learned so much about professionalism and how to better communicate with customers and my peers. Every day and week was something different. I was kept busy and I was always motivated to improve.
good,Coach strives to provide modern luxury to the public by providing affordable and fashionable leather goods. The company is well organized and dependable and management is very easy to work with. I also like that with me being a college student they are able to work with me as I continue my education.
good,"working there was amazing.  I learned a tremendeous amount and was giving opportunities to grow every day.  Corporate presence is small, so when someone leaves, it impacts everyone, so change is a given.  They move fast and are poised to be even better, from a business execution standpoint."
good,"Coach is very family oriented company with lot of flexibilities.  Good work/Life balance, co-operative staff, best management."
good,"A typical day at work is multitasking customer service with the normal daily functions of most retail jobs."
good,Coach is an industry leader in the fashion luxury and accessories brand.  I have been fortunate to be invited to be part of such an amazing company where in which |I was able to develop my skills as a managers as well as build long term relationships with some amazing and talented people along the way.
good,"As my first Store Manager always said, working at Coach was like working in retail heaven. Selling a high-end product not only felt glamorous, but the atmosphere in the store itself was like a breath of fresh air compared to most stores. The company is true to their purpose of providing superior customer service at all times and as a manager I appreciated the integrity behind that. Thriving at this store meant being a master at multi-tasking, keeping pace with client needs, a genuine desire to meet and assist new people, and working together with other employees to complete tasks and help customers. Though reaching every customer on crowded and busy days was always a challenge, my co-managers and I were constantly meeting that challenge head on, evaluating the business and planning the next move to reach our goals together with the associates. I learned many valuable business strategies as well as organizational, communication and management skills. My favorite part of this job was being a part of hiring and training associates as well as developing them in current and future roles within the company."
good,worked in a fast paste environment. Learned different parts of the warehouse
good,There isn't a high volume of customers but if you know how to sell you can make your weekly and monthly goals. It's all about making connection with people so they become loyal customers. Some employees are a lot more competitive than others.
good,"i basically make sure that all the orders are shipped out correctly."
good,I currently am very happy at coach. They are pretty flexible with schedules and I love my managers. They're pretty awesome!(Compared to other retail store managers)
good,"It is a far place to drive there. I am a cashier. I help customer to finish there purchase process. I provide costumer support. I will be a greeter when the store is not busy, or I can help process shipment. I really learned most every thing about cashier, and a lot skill of sales. Coach is a large company. The place I work is clean .and you get lot of recourse for you job. They provide you free program to learn about product, skills, history of company. The hard part of this job is traveling time. And it is not easy thing to get promote. The enjoyable of this job is you get lots of knowledgeable, skillful, friendly co-worker. Most of the time you are not feel boring."
good,"Amazing company to work for."
good,"I was a sales associate there. Pretty self explanatory, I tried to help sell merchandise to potential customers. I learned how to approach and effectively communicate with various customers."
good,Monthly discount list (merchandise from prior session) is a great way to purchase products at a reduced price. Great career advancement opportunities. Retail business is competitive.
good,"-Provide leadership and coaching to retail sales staff on selling skills"
good,"Fantastic benefits, great discount and beautiful product."
good,It had a lot of good value in this job the management was great had a good time working there.
good,My Review for Coach was an excellent working position for me. The environment was fair. My management was great..I really enjoyed my work experience at Coach warehousing.
good,Management was great. The job was easy to learn and I enjoyed my co-workers. This is a great place to work. I think they should have more fans because the warehouse tends to get hot throughout the day.
good,"Other employees were friendly and respectful.  Work place was organized. A typical day working there included organizing and stocking products. Meet sales goal,also always greet and help customers."
good,"typical day at work was focusing on making sure the clients were well serviced and greeted, learned how to be more disciplined and more conservativ, management was well organized and polished it was and enjoyable experience"
good,working at a fast pace with people willing to  show you whats new and how to better your skills
good,"I worked as a sales associate with Coach when I was in school. They taught me how to sell/ connect with customers. I can't say much for management or the benefits of the job, but it was nice to get a bag for cheap every once in a while."
good,It was very busy when I first started it had only been open for a year. It was nice working with a lot of people my age and having long hours due to the holidays is always good. Extra Cash.
good,Coach is a great place to work and I was so eager to learn more about not only the bags but the background of Coach itself and the history of the company. Ive met so many interesting customers within this experience
good,"This place is a fast paced environment where you are expected to make your goals. The management team expects for you to meet your goals every single month. If not, your job may be at risk."
good,"You wont get enough hours. Pay varies,people that have been working there get paid alot less than the new people that come in completely unfair. I get paid 14 but get 16hrs -24 but mostly 16. As pt3 you can not get more than 24 even if a colleague wants to give you their hours. I loved my job but unfortunately the hours weren't enough and plus management Is very strict you can't talk or move out of your assign area to help a costumer"
good,"A typical work day at COACH was pretty mellow with a steady flow of customers. However, on holidays it was the total opposite. I learned to treat my customers with respect and give them as much knowledge on a product to make them feel comfortable to purchase from the store. The hardest part of the job was not only making sure that individually we made our sales goal daily and weekly, but as a team make sure that met our sales goal monthly and to yearly. The most enjoyable part of the job was being around my customers and making them happy as the leave and enter the store."
good,The only holding back this organization is it's refusal to grow and evolve with the tide of today. I understand that tradition is the cornerstone for this company but it's practices and resources are very out dated. It's stunting the grow of this company into the new age.
good,"The perks were decent discounts on merchandise, first look at new releases.  Some of the cons were no commission pay, and sales is competitive.  Overall good place to work, co-workers were friendly."
good,"kids playing from all ages "

good,"Great place to work"
good,Very friendly environment everyone feels like one big family. Everyone helps out with each other when stuck in a situation. Reasonable hours and schedule flexibility.
good,The job was OK the pay was great some of the staff was friendly. I might recommend this job to a friend. Discounts were cool but never had a chance to use them because of only being there 30 days
good,Enjoyed working with a widely diverse crowd and group of people. loved how I got to learn working in retail at a different aspect. opened up my perspective of sales
good,I held various positions at Coach and enjoyed all of them.  The district and regional managers were approachable and supportive.  I love the brand and they offer great advantages for employees.
good,"• Offering tailoring service and selling approach to each individual customer needs, creates a modern luxury customer experience "
good,if your young and like to work over 40 hours this is a place for you to make money. I was a seasonal worker and the manager was very nice. break time was between 12-100 and than you would take15 minutes twice aday.  also easy job stayed busy another job you would not be looking at clock all day.
good,Coach has been my life for the last 10 years and is a place many can call home.  Coach was a wonderful brand to work for and is a company that made sure their employees were happy at all times.
good,coach is a great place to work and an awesome enviorment to be in! I love the people and also love the product. I recommend working there if you are looking for retail
good,Enjoyed working for coach very much the hardest part about the job was just leaving. My days were long but the quality of work I successfully completed was worth it.
good,As a college student I was able to see early on the benefits and opportunities COACH provided its employees. They do a great job making sales in their stores a friendly competitive part of their culture and they do ample coaching with company resources along the way. In my 2 years I was able to see 5 colleagues move quickly up the chain of command in our store and other stores including the flagship store in New York.
good,"Not too busy on weekdays "
good,"elegant, friendly, warmth working environment."
good,Love teaching kids what I was taught when I played football and wrestled. Keeping kids in line is hard but it pays off in the end. I am the leader on the team and have to make sure I keep a positive mind set.
good,I loved working at Coach and if I did not study abroad I would still be there. The people there were great. Customers are hard to deal with but that is with any job because some are really appreciative.
good,Its was a greet place to work and meet new people. The co workers and managers are friendly and good learning skills I Also got to work in deferent departments using an RF scanner and order picker experience

good,"I went into Retail, May of 2007 and have been in the field ever since then. My first retail job was Coach, Inc. and I couldn't be happier as they were the ones who gave me the great training and knowledge I have of customer service and branding!"
good,"Coach is a great company to be a part of; I went back to work for them for a reason. Their leather and sales training are on point; Visual Merchandising is where I strive and I can honestly say that for a leather goods company, Coach is on top of their game when it comes to Visual Merchandising!"
good,Coach is amazing I got along with everyone and the knowledge I learned was very interesting.
good,"i was a cashier for this company. There was many special customer service acts that we had to perform that only Coach was known for.  Like, walking the customers purchase around to them, and always asking them a ""lifestyle"" question when talking to them.  The store was always crowded with tourists from China on Tour Busses.  Everyday they would come crowding in like clockwork. The people that i worked with were very friendly and great to work with.  I got along with all of them. The managers took pride in their job. The most enjoyable part of the job was the vibe that everyone put off, customers and employees.  It was exciting to wake up everyday and go to work. I definitely enjoyed my job."
good,friendly atmosphere no reason not to like it and I'd rather not go into detail any further about my employer
good,Provide excellent and professional customer service to all customers to ensure I was in the top 5 sales associates in the company. Be able to clientele and follow up with customers on a daily basis. Be very aware of all Coach branding and products available on the market to ensure loyalty with the customer. Transitioned from Oakpark Mall to Caesar’s Palace flagship location.
good,It was always exciting to assist those who were shopping for gifts. I enjoyed interpreting and converting the conversations I had with shoppers into the best and memorable gifts.
good,A typical day includes non stop critcal thinking and being goal oriented.  Always thinking on your feet on ways to improve your everyday business.  Hardest part of the job would be trying to develope your staff as well as yourself and having upper mangement handicap that.  Just because certain people may be complacent in their career doesn't mean every one else is in the same boat.  Best part of the job is being able to be an innovater in all different aspects of your business.  Traveling is also a plus.
good,"A typical work day would include matching shipment reports with items recieved, organizing inventory, communicating effectively with management to achieve daily goals."
good,"As a sales associate a typical day of work included receiving daily goals to acheive. Assisting clients in a friendly and efficient manner.

good,Coach is very good job their very strict but it's a good thing.
good,"I enjoyed working for Coach. The people there was so nice, and the bags were so cute. The Coach Outlet in Vicksburg,Ms is a great Store to work at. The location is excellent,and the environment is nice as well. The store stayed pretty steady. I learned the difference between a fake Coach and an Authentic Coach bag and what the numbers meant. The most hardest part was having to deal with rude customers and the fun part was seeing all the new bags come in,"
good,the experience i had on coach was a great learning experience. i learned very valuable skills that will come in handy for my next occupations
good,Aquisição de novos conhecimento e desenvolvimento profissional.

good,"Fun & competitive, focused on customer satisfaction, management team is great"
good,"Management and co-workers were always on hand to offer support advice and tips to better my work. I learned the importance of product knowledge and that is an important tool in helping customers, as well as yourself. The hardest part of the job was getting to understand all the merchandise as well as the new things coming in. The best part of the job was having the understanding and confidence in being able to help others."
good,"I have been working for Coach since I was eighteen years old. I fell in love with the brand at an early age, and I frequently went to the store at my local mall. Before I was eligible to work there, they asked me to work there claiming that my personality and cheery disposition was perfect for the job. I started working there 2 months after my eighteenth birthday once I had returned home from college. I proceeded to work there on my winter and summer breaks from school. This past holiday I was promoted to holiday manager, given that I knew what was required in the fast paced environment that is a holiday in retail. It was not a difficult transition, and my co- workers and the management were helpful and very supportive."
good,Working for Coach has been extremely rewarding. I have worked there in both an Assistant Manager Role and currently part time. This is a company that prides themselves on providing stellar service to all customers. The environment has been conducive to my social and education skills. The hardest part of the job is pleasing every customer and ensuring that they will return to our store to do business with us again in the future. I have learned that people appreciate honesty and genuineness. It’s not enough to simply sell products but explain to customers the value of having such a piece in their personal collection. The most enjoyable part of the job is walking away feeling like I introduced a new customer to a great American brand that will be a part of their life for many years to come.
good,"I did a lot of different jobs inside this company. Every one of the jobs I did perform, I was side-by-side with an experienced worker, who would show me how to work the job at hand. Workers there were humorous, which I love in job areas (you can work at ease), and everyone got along great! Managers weren't there always, but when you needed them there they were."
good,"Working here was always fun. The managers were fair, and they always had contests, amazing discounts, and it was never like a job."
good,was only a seasonal but had a great time while doing it black friday is crazy! potluck on holidays so fun!
good,greated customers and helped find them the perfect bag. worked with register. Had sales goals witch helped me in other jobs.
good,Coach employees are very friendly. Coach tends to have lunch provided on certain days.
good,I have loved every year that I have work with this company. Not the best company for advancement if you want to work in management you need to interview for that because a lot of people myself included get stuck in their position.
good,"Wa busy and stressful a times - worked A LOT for it being a temporary contract role."
good,"Everyone works as a team and everyone helps each other.  "
good,My experience workimy at coach is very productive everyone is experienced in heir job the place is very clean and it a very good company to work for the supervisor help you if you need help they treat you like a person not a worker
good,"working here has taught me a lot about patience, and customer service. Management and co-workers are friendly and make work environment a bit less stressful."
good,"•	Greet customers at the door "
good,"great company, great values, very consuming"
good,Coach is a goid job it have alot of nice ppl working there the management what's good security was good I loved the hours I learned alot about coach while I was there .
good,It’s ok working at coach great over time during the busy season. But you have to go thru a temp agency to even work for them where u don’t get no pto or vacation time off. The Help desk people needs to be back in training they talk to you like you slow but they the ones dumb but the job will be great if they replace the help desk people. Call from customer are ok even when they call in upset. What make me don’t care about putting my all in the job is knowing that it’s not guaranteed hire. So knowing that u might not get hired on permanently will have you not caring about the jobz
good,"It's a job you go to do your job and go home"
good,"Coach was an amazing place & Company to work for. I really miss working there and was disappointed when the shut down. Great co workers, management & company!"
good,The company and what it stands for is great. Competitive pay for the retail industry. I'm not as passionate about the fashion industry and that is what really creates growth with the company.
good,"I worked 8 hours as a high school student. it was a very well run place.  it taught me a lot of sales skills, while also enhancing my communication skills. I was the youngest hired."
good,"I learned at Coach to work with every team to get the job done. ""Its not my job"" was never in a conversation. Respect and devotion to the brand was a priority."
good,Start off by clocking in greeting all co working politely and with respect and checking in with bosses and making sure the day is good to go for me. Go out to Greet and help all customers to the fullest find there needs and direct them to where they need to be at. lifting heavy loads in the back of the store for shipment day. I have learned many things from my job such as self respect and to be very independent along with much more. I enjoy this job to the fullest. I learned something new every day. That would be the hard part to me but i enjoy that because i am learning. My Management is great and very flexible and easy to work with. They understand you as you understand them and they treat you with respect as if you would treat them with the same if more respect. I treat my Management with extreme respect as to all people they deserve it even if they are not being polite i still will be calm and treat a person with care and respect. Its my core Values and just morels to do!
good,"I really enjoyed working at coach. Everyday I came in we would do exercises to get us motivated for the long day ahead. I worked the night shift from 4p-2:45a so we really needed the boost. I worked there a yr so I advanced from just a warehouse worker to supervising and training new employees. I mainly worked in the pr, upper and lower vas departments. Most of my coworkers were easy to get along with but like most jobs there's always a few that just didnt want to be there so of course I avoided them. The hardest part of the job I would say was being able to complete my work and all last minute projects given to me in a timely manner as well as monitor and help others. My most enjoyable part was interacting and being cross trained in other departments. I really love learning and gaining knowledge about any company I work for!!!!"
good,Selling luxury leather good to customers and helping them find a product they will love.
good,"Forklift driving, removing boxes from trailers, filling out reports, picking customers product orders from warehouse."

good,"Love the job, had to leave due to the poor work life balance as a mother & wife but overall my experience there was great & I would go back for the holiday season!"
good,A typical day at work was coming in on time punching in and review the sales promotions before starting the day.  What I learned at Coach its that you got to be aggressive at the sales and give an excellent customer service.
good,All around Coach was a pleasant work place with a diverse team both culturally and generationally. Pay was far and Tiered employment status made it easy to balance multiple jobs. Coach also had one of the best break structures of any company i've worked for.
good,The Coach is a family orientated business that is fast paced and never dull. There is no bookings therefore this makes for a very interesting dynamic which has got to be managed very carefully to ensure that everything from the staffing structure to guest expectation works and runs smoothly at all times.
good,they always had there days as far as customers and there purchases. I didn't love the stories with different customers and helping them find gifts for their self and for families members
good,I love working at coach even though I was working through a temp service. I love to experience different pocket book and exc.
good,I learned to work under extreme circumstance during busy holiday seasons.  Management was very helpful.
good,Fast paced. Learned about Coach heritage and resources. Hardest part of the job is getting a window shopper into becoming a active customer.

good,my time at coach was a great experience in the retail industry. It was a great and safe environment and everyone was friendly. The bonus was the great employee discount.
good,"Working at Coach was enjoyable, specially if you like fashion and handbags. The discount offered was great. Hired as a seasonal worker, else I would have stayed longer. The job was demanding and fast paced during the holidays, overwhelming and tiring at times. But fun and I would recommend this work place."
good,"I learned a great deal in a short amount of time at Coach. I was able to have Q&A with upper executive management, see retail products built from the ""sole"" up, collaborate with several different cross functional partners and experience what it is like to do a comprehensive comparative analysis project presented to the COO. All around a great first step into my career path which lead my to my next job at Cole Haan."
good,Coach is a nice places to work at if you want to bring more knowledgeable about leather and how it's made. Coach will teach you the ends and out of the company.

good,great place with great crew always fun and something different each day.
good,"I didn't mind the job at all. I went to work during the hours I was scheduled. It was not a typical 9-5 as we rotated everyone to get a chance to open, close and leave during the business day. Management was fair. I loved my co-workers. It was a youthful and vibrant group of people. The hardest part of the job was closing the store. I enjoyed working with customers. I like talking to people. It was a great experience. I want to work here again."
good,I have full freedom to do my responsibility and the company trusts it's employees on their performance.
good,"All day long I would assist mothers,boyfriends,husbands,fathers, and relatives alike make the perfect choice for them.

good,"I value Coach's respect and pride to their own brand and culture. They have created a very fun and educational experience for all who choose to work with their company including keeping their employees educated about their future and past products, designs and styles. In addition to this, they also frequently train and test their employees about proper sales techniques, brand history and fashion to keep them on their toes and ahead of any competition as well as help to improve overall productivity. Their expectations are high to ensure that they are consistently providing the best customer service and value to their consumer with the products that they develop. "

The first management team really had problems with staying in their roles; it was the store manager's first store and the team crumbled."

good,"I really enjoyed working for Coach for the time that I did. I ended up leaving this job because I was looking for a change in career, but I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a job, and I would accept a position there again. I worked for Coach Outlet as a cashier, and the position was good. The pay at Coach is highly competitive for a service-industry position, and at the end of each month, if the store exceeded set goals, then the entire team, from front of house to back of house, was eligible for a payroll bonus on a rolling basis; for example, 5% over goal and so on, so long as you work more than 70 hours in a month. If my store hit our goal, there was a chance that on the second week of the following month, I would receive my usual paycheck plus a bonus, which was like half a week's worth of work for a low bonus, and nearly an entire second paycheck for a high bonus."
good,"Working at Coach was one of the best experiences I've had with any company. The is an abundance of learning that can be done there with great, caring people.

The management team was made up of very positive people who always encouraged us to do our best.

good,Everyday at Coach is fun and exciting. The staff and other employees are hard workers and very determined.

good,Working there was great. I learned so much about purses and how they are made by hand from specially collected and inspected leather.  The managers were all nice.
good,"I worked at Coach both part-time and full-time for 6 years and I had a great experience. In comparison to working at other retail stores/brands, Coach was the best company to work for in my opinion and I would work for the company again if the opportunity came about. The workplace culture is collaborative, but like all sales, at times it can feel particularly cut-throat and stressful. However, I always felt secure with my job and management did their best to place associates in their most suited roles. The brand is iconic and stands up to its reputation (my bags are almost 10 yrs old and look brand new) and the pay and benefits are great. I'm unsure if it is still a benefit currently, but when I was employed at Coach, some part-time workers (highest tier of avg hours worked per week; 20+) qualified for health insurance and all benefits that are typically only offered to full-time management. As a part time worker during college, receiving these benefits was a fantastic option and definitely kept us part time associates loyal and turnover to a minimum in comparison to most retail stores. Only great things to say about Coach!"
good,Overall a great job. I worked seasonal & got raises everytime I came back. Working at a busy store made it easy to get bonuses. It was very competitive as well
good,"The staff at Coach was very friendly and quick to help with anything you may need while working there. Overall a great place for a first job, advancement available."
good,"The company is great on focusing on the goals that they want to achieve and they motivate and encourage all the staff members pursue that goal, which is a good way to teach people the importance of the effort that you put on your work."
good,You don't have just one position here. You go from register to selling to putting back stock to organizing all of the stock. It was a very pleasant experience working there and I would definitely recommend others to work there. Management tries to keep it light.
good,"I loved working for Coach. I highly recommend it. It is a very busy place especially over the holidays, but with the good managment that was in the store, everything was done in a timely manner. It can get stressful working with different customers but mostly it was enjoyable experience. I would highly recommend this company."

good,"Coach is a great company that stands behind their products and stand on their rich history. Also, Coach truly invests in work life balance and incentive."
good,I was an intern in the Summer of 2015. It was an incredible experience that allowed me to really see the execution of a full season - from conception to brand presentation.
good,"I have been employed with Coach, Inc for 3 years and I can truly say this has been the most lucrative job that I have had to date. Over the years this company has offered amazing incentives and benefits that are both bebficial to me and my family, Also, I have learned so much and developed into a well rounded manager."
good,I am sad that my experience with Coach ended. The reason I left coach is because the store closed and it was to far for me to travel to the next available store.
good,"while working as an inventory specialist, getting hands on product knowledge when shipments of freight came in, was well worth to serve clients while also maintaining the status quo."
good,"Coach offers an environment that is passionate about its product line, customer service standards and the core of the company, its employees.

good,Opening a closing processes
good,Learned more with Coach than any other organization. Management was willing to empower their employees and challenge them continually to perform at their highest level. Great people. But work/life balance difficult for people with families.
good,I worked at Coach for six years. Starting off as an associate manager at the flag ship store on the Mag. Mile. It was really fun and fast paced. I learned so much at this job. I would say the biggest take away was how important it is for a management team to be on the same page.

good,"In working at Coach I learned about operating cash registers and lots of other normal retail aspects that I previously hadn't experienced.  I worked with a lot of lovely people who understood and respected me. However, this probably just comes with working in retail but a few of the customers were terribly rude to me even if I had told them I was inexperienced."
good,"Highly recommend the Tilton, NH Coach Outlet to anyone that wants to work with a great team of hardworking, friendly sales professionals.  Excellent Management Team!"
good,a typical day would consist on me starting to set everything up for opening by making sure we were stocked up on everything and that it was neat along with making sure my co-workers have everything they need to attack the day strongly.

good,"Great company, values your opinion, communicative, excellent discount and perks, great bonus structures, they want to success you as much as possible."
good,"Great place to work family like coworkers and management, I worked part-time when I was employed  by coach so I'm not sure of any benefits or salary but it was a great place to work. The reason I left coach was I didn't receive any hours and needed something full-time, on the other hand if you're looking for a career in retail and willing to put in some work you'll have a great career with coach."
good,Had an amazing time growing and learning with very smart and helpful co-workers.  My managers were all great and they were always open to hearing my ideas and hearing what I had to say.  They learned from me as well as me learning from them.

good,I enjoyed working at Coach. I've always loved the product so when I was able to help other people find the love for the product also it was very rewarding. The only set back was it was only seasonal and part-time
good,Number one priority is always taking care of the customer. I continued to learn things from my store manager and other managers. The benefits package was excellent for someone in my position. I was also fortunate to be part of a great team. The only downside was that there were not many opportunities for advancement.
good,"working alone is a plus for me , this is where I first learned how to ship and receive . my hardest part of the job was the end of the day. management was great  never had a problem with them over seeing your work."

I learned communication skills very quickly and still use them everyday. My employment at Coach was extremely beneficial.
good,"I loved my time at Coach. Coworkers were supportive and displayed great team work. They were understanding with scheduling and trying to give requested time off. Being as they are open later then most, shifts were pretty flexible."
good,"Great workplace, nice Job work/life balance."
good,"Who wouldn't love to work selling luxury handbags? Coach offers top-of-the-line sales training to its associates. If you have to work in retail, you want to work for Coach."
good,"A great job with great people, can be boring though when it isn't busy."
good,"Loved making people happy by selling something they loved.  Management was a big turn over and did not like to promote within which I never understood.  I love working with people and usually (99% of the time) can turn a negative situation into a positive one.  For my the hardest part is to sell something to someone they do not need, I have always felt you get more of there business by being honest and giving them what they need.  In the long run you get more of there business."
good,"Every day seems different. I do not have a manager watching my every move. Everyday I have to open at least one The Bay credit card account, where I usually open two sometimes more. I have a wide variety of tasks that need to be completed throughout the day such as: cleaning, doing the cash, selling and associating customers. My co-workers are great, I have never seen or been part of a misunderstanding with anyone since I have started."
good,This place taught me how to pretty much do everything in the work place. I truly learned to multitask and be a hard worker. The pay is great and so are the hours.

I have done warehouse work and have one year of stock management experience. I have 11 years of customer service, retail, and cash handling experience."
good,"good management "
good,This company takes care of their employees. They work with your schedule. The compensation is great and the work atmosphere is amazing!
good,I took a position with this company in entry management although I had been a senior executive in management with another retail company years before. Because of this I was able to have a balanced personal life and yet be able to use my experience to grow business and develop strong customer relationships as well as train co-workers. I was richly rewarded for my years with the company and was pleased to know I was a valued employee. I only left the company because our store closed and I was placed at a location much too far from my home.

The most enjoyable part is making someone's day by providing them with a quality product."

good,"Being in retail your shift would change but there was consistency with the hours. Full-time employees were given full-time hours. The store manager and all managers were extremely nice, flexible, and easy to get along with. The co-workers there were very easy to get along with as well. Through Coach Factory I learned how to conduct inventory and process incoming and outgoing shipments through an automated scanning system. Inventory consisted of an actual physical count that required the scanning of every handbag in the stock room."
good,"I started off as a sales associate and am now interning at corporate. I have loved Coach from the beginning. From the the store level to corporate, Coach is definitely one of the best retail companies to work for."
good,"The Coach I worked at was great and I loved my experience there. The management team was super nice and helpful. The associates (plus managers) worked really well together and we were like family. Working with them was so enjoyable that I never dreaded coming to work and usually at work I feel like the time passes really fast. I learned a lot about the Coach Culture and how to sell using that culture. Of course, I also sharpened my sales and communication skills while working there. The hardest part of the job would be that since it's retail, you will meet some rude people here and there but oh well."

It's a good environment with great people that turn into good friends."
good,Very typical retail job. Surprisingly great benefits and retirement plans. Can't complain about their 70% off employee discount. Didn't really enjoy working over the holidays
good,"Being employed here, they expect you to represent the brand 100% and show your best face. A typical day consists of a morning meeting before the store opens with some pep talk from management. Customers can be draining, but if you're a people person and have great interpersonal skills, you will do great."

good,I worked here for a short time but was really pleased with the opportunities and culture of the company.

good,"This is a sales based job and if you don't like to talk to people then this is not the job for you. If you are good at selling to people, you would be great. The compensation for sales is great if the team works together. You do not earn commission for individual sales, but if you hit team goals as a tram, the top sellers can get a bigger bonus. There is a lot to learn about the products but it is great. Loved the people I worked with and for."

I've learned to deal with patience and how to communicate our foreign travelers. The management is very well organized. We have about 10 managers, and they are all someone I know I can talk to you about what is going on inside the workplace. My co-workers and I have different types of relationships. We work very well together and have great team building skills. I would say the hardest part of the job is trying to communicate with foreign travelers. I have learned to respond and interact with them even though I'm not always sure of what they are asking of me. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with my co-workers. Everyone at Coach has bright personalities and we all mesh very well together. I know if I have any questions for my co-workers I can rely on any of them to help me the best they can."
