rating,review
bad,"The operating company of KAVOKerr has poor leadership, management is completely detached from the issues and challenges of their employees. The Alpharetta office is in dire need of restructuring"
bad,"They overwork you and then change the way you get paid frequently. Management is horrible. There is no training and no organization whatsoever. If you are looking for a career there is no advancement. Processes are horrible, knowledge of systems and products of management team is horrible. You are better off working for Burger King."
bad,Advancement was based on who you knew and how much you were willing to give up to management! Once you bring issues to management for resolution you're labeled as a trouble maker.
bad,Culture of squeezing employees and costs to make the numbers.  Creates tremendous pressure and stress on employees to save pennies leading to burnout and low morale.
bad,I worked countless hours of overtime before and after there switching from paper to all digital. And all it got me was more taxes i had to pay and my miniumal bonus. If you plan on working here know you can never be sick or late . Vacation requests are going to be based on time with the company and for new employees are very limited on dates and prorated. The benefits are expenses and are very basic with alot of employee out of pocket expenses. If you have a family or enjoy time with them then this is not the place for you.
bad,"Working at Danaher is very frustrating since Priorities are swapped like underwear."
bad,"Danaher overall was a good organisation to work with however since they have a various business segments , In those segments they yet to follow Danaher culture. "
bad,"This company is fragmented and poorly managed. It will drive hard, use up and cast away good employees without care or understanding."
bad,"I cannot say many polite things about this organization as I feel that it is highly dysfunctional in many ways, and I do not wish to jeopardize my employment should someone who works for this organization read my review and be able to determine who I am based on the information I provide."
bad,"The workplace culture should be one of continuous improvement but many of the habits, culture, and processes in acquired operating companies remains stagnant in the 'this is the way it's always been done'."
bad,"hostile environment, too much expectations that are unrealistic goals are hard to achieve, some management has no interpersonal skills so makes it hard to motivate"
bad,I worked in Claris . Typical day consist of running orders based due dates. Taking 5 specs an hour packaging wrapping orders scanning skids shrink wrapping for shipment and performing life test called an alt test
bad,With multiple product launches rushed through the process skipping critical steps has only cratered the moral of the sales teams and put our internal teams at odds with self inflicted pain. Long term employees want nothing to do with DBS and its processes. It’s a game with everyone looking.
bad,"Leadership did not uphold nor honor the Leadership Anchors."
bad,"no sure how things are nowadays but compensation was good, work balance was good, plant director ok, good place to learn lean tools."
bad,"Hight pressure company that works you 7 days a week 14 hours a day.   Set unrealistic expectations.   The initial interview are all smoke and mirrors, and change on you after you start."
bad,"Danaher has the worst management ever. The management focus more on friendship than business. Favoritism is out of this world. There is definitely no trust with the management team. We cannot even go to our human resource for help. The rules are not for everyone. Certain individuals are definitely excluded. The pay is horrible meaning an individual that has been there for 40 years is making the same thing as individuals that have been there for 3 to 5 years performing the same task. The raises are definitely unfair. How can your grade be the same every year even though you exceeded in mostly everything that was expected, but still receive the same raise year after year? You cannot advance in this place. It is according on who you are. It should be based off of skill, education, and performance, as well as some other qualifications, but race should not be one. Hate to sound cliché, but race is definitely a factor. You do not have to take my word, just visit the facility and do a walk through up front in the office area and decide for yourself."
bad,Terrible manager in the Lab and always on the phone trying to get auto parts for his racing machine
bad,"I did not have good experience with this company. They have overstated the job, relocated me and after nine months after they have tried to make me be CNC programmer from a Senior Engineer, they forced me to quit and I had to refund my relocation. I am a foreigner so I felt that only domestic people were up for promotion, and I have not been there enough to really see if I'd get a chance. They had a pregnant manufacturing engineer working 12 hour grave yard shifts while taking anti depressant pills so that some day she could become engineering manager, or plant manager. The manager who had hired me and most of the production people were good people. The upper management did not care about anything else except profits. "
bad,I have heard that it improved since Thermo bought it. When I was there the management treated scientists like cogs in a machine.
bad,Lack of communication between managers. The proper information needed on both shift are not relayed properly and blame the employees for not getting the job done.
bad,"poor understanding of culture, Business sustainability strategies"
bad,"The management allows too much gossip and bickering among employees without addressing it. The work itself is fairly easy but with the environment being as it is it ruins the moral. The hours and break times are fair and there are member of management that can get things done but all in all the experience while there was abysmal. Even co-workers actively attempt to get others terminated with false information,"
bad,Danaher/Beckman Coulter still owes me a lot of money for past expenses paid. Has not yet reimbursed me for months! This is even after years of dedication to the company. Is this how they treat employees?
bad,"The Danaher company that I worked at was wonderful, pre-Danaher. When Danaher takes over, although tough, the business improvements are definitely good for the business. The people, however, suffer. There is complete lack of concern for long-term employees; people who have no other skill than what they have been doing for 30-40 years. They do not want old people or old ""tainted"" culture. If you are young and ready to climb a ladder, this is the place for you. Otherwise, steer clear."
bad,Management here left a lot to be desired.  No employee connections.  No idea what was happening around them.  A lot of favoritism and significant bullying.
bad,"Danaher is a great company if you are a stockholder, no so much as an employee. Management will change every 6 months with escalating stress with each succession"
bad,The job was people friendly but they did not pay enough for all the work that was put in. It felt as if they only used the temp workers to get their parts up but as soon as they had enough parts they would lay off again; causing people to have to struggle to find work.
bad,I just came in and did my usual tasks every day. I didn't really have anything hard about the job. I enjoyed the people that I worked with.
bad,The company spent a lot of money on lean consulting only to not follow the guidance or process. Very anti-union.
bad,"I am very disappointed in the management and culture.  Focus is on the next quarterly statement.  There is a clear lack of understanding of basic science here and no desire to innovate or improve on cost, schedule or quality."
bad,"Straight up production work, same thing over & over again, you would hope sometimes a machine broke down so you could take somewhat of a break."
bad,The purchase of the lawyers favourite PSL website by American information giant Reuters has lead to the impact of American ways on this UK institution. Whilst it suited some hot-desking did not suit me and I was frequently located in other departments rather than with my own department colleagues.
bad,Life work balance is not balanced. The hardest part of the job is the workplace culture. It is filled with too many meetings and not enough on the floor time with staff. Most enjoyable part of the job is the developed DBS culture.
bad,Seems like  the people that have been there 10 plus years dont teach you everything  for fear of losing their job. Also  the management could be more better with enforcing rules and regulations. It's been a bad experience for myself. No respect and very stressful
bad,A typical day at work consist of fulfilling customers orders by meeting our assigned rates. My co-workers were definitely team players. There wasn't really any hard task on the job. The most enjoyable part of the job was the social conversations with the co-workers while maintaining a professional manner by fulfilling the assigned orders.
bad,"•	Gained price savings over $100,000 in 2016, and identified price savings opportunities over $400,000 for 2017. "
bad,"It beats unemployment I suppose.  Not a very good environment for personal or professional growth, but you'll definitely learn how to do for yourself because you'll receive no formal training and the management has no experience with any of the products."
good,The reshuffle of departments and department heads happen too often causing so much interruption in a business standpoint and individual responsibilities confusion.
good,It was okay to work there but working in a temp agency for over 3 years was not understood. No advancement under those circumstances I would have loved to still have been there.
good,"Similar job functions are colocated making networking and communication easy.  However, the open architecture can get quite loud at times making it hard to work on the phone."
good,Dynamic culture and a good place to learn the project management skills and lean concepts. Could be challenging work environment to manage work/life balance.
good,"An Australian owned multi sited UK company, growing rapidly through acquisition. Current concentration is on asset and customer account reorganisation. Drive is to grow both customer and market share."
good,I worked there for 30 years before being laid off.
good,Bring in college students as young mgr with No experience. And mgrs not willing to learn process before making changes ...to know what impact it may have on others down the line.
good,"Good experience for engineering co-op. Decent projects provided for real-world experience, but not a great deal of oversight or guidance. Useful skills and business practices learned."

good,"I do not wish to write one due to legal obligations. Do not publish, Legal case do not publish this. I do not give opinions of previous employers for legal reasons."
good,Danaher/Fluke was a sink or swim company and I choose to swim. I had to grow/learn quickly in order to survive. I had the opportunity to learn in detail about MRP Systems and how everything systematically is connected regarding inventory management.
good,"Danaher was exciting in that it continuously tried to improve its processes. It did not offer career advancement though. It was not true to the ""value"" of promoting from within. Only few people who were willing to work two or three jobs ever got promoted, or if there was an innate need for someone's skillset. Promotion was not offered to most people which is against their mission to keep good talent. A lot of people leave Danaher b/c they are offered a better opportunity somewhere else and Danaher will not match it."
good,It is a place where they want you to work even if the product is not built to standers They rush the workers put to much work on one person.The workers are way under paid.
good,Due too high growth the company has lost the core values that made them successful.
good,"Review a  current state process"
good,"High caliber talent, high quality products, DBS provides great tools that apply to any business"
good,The company is very new in India has to go a long way to get stabilized. Though the company is with multi-business operations are not close knitted. All business operational companies operating separately with very small market penetration makes growth difficult in short time. Brand building activities are required and proper sync with HQ is always required for growth.
good,"Teaching life sciences is my passion, and as such i enjoy teaching it. I engage my students effectively and explain in a very simplified manner, covering all necessary aspects."
good,The business is focused on its bottom line and has perfected the Danaher Business System.  Employees are taught how to use DBS and are rewarded as they utilize the process.
good,"The job is not ""Life Sciences"" it is teaching.  It is likely the hardest job that you will ever do but it can also be extremely rewarding.  The most difficult aspects will usually be parents and administration - not students."
good,"Cada dia um desafio, ambiente de trabalho bom, Diretoria ausente"
good,I was only present at Danaher for 3 months but was not satisfied with my work or my workplace. The facilities are extremely old and the company is Lean to an extreme. Every employee was efficient but not effective because they were so overworked.
good,"You will wear many hats at this company and absorb many tasks that are not related to your actual job,"
good,Good company to work for. The culture really is poor though. Little or nothing done to engage the employees. It is a demanding culture though.
good,Customer focused. Very regulated work environment. Not very flexible with new ideas.
good,I was fun working there one time until we got
good,Extremely hard working employees that strive to go above and beyond in a very lean business culture. Access to Danaher Business System training and courses is a major benefit.
good,"Decent benefits. Low employee moral. Low employee involvement. Only concerned with the numbers for the quarter being a publicly traded company. Will risk the long term to make the short term look good. No vision on engineering or quality. Make today's numbers, forget about tomorrow."
good,good company to work for. Given the locations that it operates its hard to attract talent and keep it challenging. Mid-senior level managers are pushed to the limits which is good.
good,"DBS is dominant. Cost saving is the goal."
good,I feel there is a lack of advancement opportunities since I am needed in my current dept and position.  There are only three of us in the dept.  The work is interesting and challenging but I do not feel I am compensated for my work and ability.
good,"Monitored and operate machines and machine’s temperature"
good,Came in on the startup of a metallurgical lab. While the people were great the knowledge of running a lab of this sort was lacking. The manager was harsh and did not understand that sometimes new equipment did not function properly.

good,"When a 200 person company is folded into a 50,000 person company there are many changes to the culture and the people who work for the smaller company."
good,"Like anything, you either fit into the culture or not. Peer to peer support integration is great, management is a dice roll. Typical corporate experience."
good,"I used Leader standard work to make sure I touched base with each manufacturing line, usually about 2 hours each morning.  I would listen to each manufacturing associate as they explained any challenges they had that could disrupt their production output.  Where I could assist I would jump in and accept specific actions."
good,ogni giorno è diverso dal precedente. Ogni giorno si apprende qualcosa di nuovo
good,Very Fast paced with large product mix. Very Lean. Good management staff currently that wants to do the right thing. Strong on-boarding process but only for upper managers. Individual contributors are on their own.

Prefer to hire within organization to bring up their associates but focus external to bring in the right talent on new business
good,"At Danaher we worked very hard trying to get products made in order to make our rates. We stood all day on our shifts in pretty much one spot which took some getting use to. We had 3 breaks throughout an eight hour shift. Two were fifteen minute breaks and our lunch break was thirty minutes. Working there is not hard work, but the labor takes much energy and time from workers"
good,Very strong culture at danaher and hungry for success. Bring your A game on! Very data driven company with a lot of metrics and discipline.

good,"Danaher provides a highly flexible work environment for employees, with lots of open spaces for employees to work from, rather than confining them to one office space. Overall, it was a good experience."
good,"Pressure to perform to goal was relentless and unforgiving. Seemed all that was cared about was the profits, not what the employee was needing. Performance was the only underlying tone, basically at all costs."
good,"A typical day at work would start by kitting parts needed to assemble the product my co-workers were working on."
good,It was a good place to work and a good company to be involved with the company is associated with Sears and machining making tools.

good,The co workers were awesome. The working environment had times of great stress and concern with it ever changing and being a worldwide company.

good,"I like my job very much but my manager won’t let me move up. He would not want to lose me to another VSL. This seems to be the norm for other leaders, they hold back the top workers."
good,High customer service demand. Most work was done individually without much team work. Required a lot of push demands instead of being able to be proactive. Requires more communication between departments internally. Customer service is required for internal just as much as an external customer.

I went from machine operator, to Cybron Production and Scaling, to Quality Assurace Technician. Paying attention to detail and the need to learn more than my assigned postion, I am able to advance in my knowledge and understand how the departments work together to produce the desired outcome of parts and assembly. I enjoy leaning how to make new molds, how to adjust them, and gaining knowledge of what is part does for each customer we produce for. The engineers work closly with me to teach me details of their work, so I may improve constantly on my job in quality. I work closely with management in my daily work schedule where I feel free to make suggestions or offer advice to make operations more organized or improved as well as follow instructions given to me, I work overtime and in the place of those that may need to miss a day.I work weekends when needed and other shifts when needed."

I worked second shift by my self which I enjoyed very much. No one was around to bother me or run into to , witch meant I could get a lot done. Management was some what of a problem because in the time I was there we had 4 different programmers, 3 different supervisors and 3 different plant managers all who had different ideas of how things should be done. As far as I could tell there was no discrimination. and most people treated me with respect and courtesy. The most enjoyable part  of the job for me was digging through the scrap barrel digging out material to make things with i.e.; fixtures, and repair parts for other depts. The hardest part of the job was trying to locate things I need for fixtures , and cutting tools .I had to hand grind or repair smashed or broken tools.
