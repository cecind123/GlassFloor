bad,They choose friends and family to operate the building. There is no reward for working hard. They abuse the elderly employees and force them to work long hours while the young ones get away with being lazy
bad,Absolutely stay away from this location.  Management has effectively chased out all talented people.  Management has absolutely no respect for their workers
bad,"It’s a decent job for high school graduates. Weekly pay"
bad,"when you ask a question to your supervisor or coordinator they always seem to irgnore you, when they tell you no eating, chewing or building ahead of themselves but you see the assemblers eating on the line then its ok for them to eat and build ahead of themselves as if their being favored. I don't like that enivironment. we also have a very lazy coordinator who will not help our leads out and only stands there making excuses up about they got to do something else and assigns their own job to the leads as if the leads are coordinators. "
bad,The management was only concerned about themselves.  Management used underhanded tactics. Management would change policy to please certain people. There was a lot of favoritism
bad,"Upper Management couldn't care less. They worry about their own jobs and basically are the laziest people in the company. Benefits are awful, took away pensions, hospital insurance gets more expensive and less coverage every year. Layoffs are normal. No job security. Don't really think the company is doing very well."
bad,One of the worst places I've ever worked. Terrible management.  Terrible pay for work expected. Hated this place and would not wish it on my worst enemy
bad,Please do not work here. The manager is unprofessional and do not know how to manage personnel. She talks behind everyone's back and looks to deceive while causing altercations. She is a cancer. I regret working for this company.
bad,"Lack and Poor communication, stressful work environment, no help when needed.  Unmotivated employees,  no opportunities to grow in company unless you were favored even though you work hard.  Poor pay filler the amount of work and stress involved."
bad,"If you can get a job anywhere but  LSC (formally RRDonnelly) do it."
bad,"Management was completely incompetent! Too much emotion, unrealistic expectations. Poor training. No direction or teamwork. Hostile work environment. No team chemistry at all. You will not be heard."
bad,"A typical 12-hour day only consists of a 30 min break and a misly 10-minute break.  The working conditions were horrid: loud machines, filthy work environment, and fumes lingering throughout the plant. Overall, it's an old rundown plant with little to no safety regulations.  I was told during the interview and in an email that I will be getting a hiring bonus.  A few months of working, HR said to me that they made a mistake, and I no longer qualified for the hiring bonus.  They made it clear that they did me a favor by not having to pay them back.  The only positive thing about this place was the selected few co-workers in my work area.  They were great."
bad,"My training was good. Then my new manager on nights is a joke. If you do not belong to the bubba network and kiss his butt.....they will do everything to run you off or get you fired. This has been ongoing for years. The bubbas do not like to work....bad management and planning. If someone from corporate would open their eyes and see what is happening....then maybe you would not have a high turnover rate and your production would be up. No matter what you do....you always suck in their eyes. Oh and hey their 15 minute lunch break is totally illegal."
bad,"No clear direction or management structure. The tasks your given set you up for failure.  As a BA I was hired to take blame for the failures of the previous BA and now current manager. She scolded me on a daily basis, in the same manner she scolded and cursed at her children.  She always made you feel worthless and never gave constructive or clear work to do.  But you had to complete it her way and only her way. Too bad she never told you how to do it.  I was a human punching bag that got slain and beaten by 3 abrasive managers.  My immediate manager was in Seattle, totally clueless, while the former BA and now manager was the one I worked with. She was in PA. The third was in-office Warrenville, IL and criticized everything I did.  No accomplishments were made as each spent the day making your life impossible."
bad,"My experience at RR Donnelley was horrible."
bad,They ran the plant in to the ground.  Lied to the employees as well as upper management.  Didn't repair the facility for 20 years.   The bathrooms were despicable as well as the lunchrooms.
bad,"Worked there for 6 years. Got laid off after my manager lied about my work so she could save her job. The company split and everyone was just trying to save themselves. Turns out, getting let go made me realize how awful of a place it was to work for. Nobody listened to your explanations on how things worked or why they were done the way they were done, yet nobody would tell you how to do anything. Training was a joke."
bad,"Poor management, no experience and doesn’t support the people under her.  No advancement opportunities. 1% raise annually not based on performance, everyone gets same raise and doesn’t meet cost of living increases so I make less money every year I stay!"
bad,nobody really knows whats going on nothing is super visors fault they'll tell you you dont like their way thers the door. oh and they'll try to motivate you by putting you down (example any moron can run a machine.) yell at you for something that has nothing to do with your department.
bad,"Poor poor poor company to work for managers are so  unprofessional break all rules around password security, confidentiality and the Line managers have no people skills don’t even know who the staff are. Poorest type of management skills I’ve ever seen I’ve had a lucky escape.  Pay is disgusting, benefits poor working conditions poor make u work like a factory when your an office worker. Keep agency staff as agency forever people who have worked there for 5 years still agency. My advice don’t work for this company."
bad,"do not work here if you have a choice, bad culture and management that over works you and has no care for work and life balance, if you have young kids , good luck trying to make both your employer and your family happy!"
bad,Unqualified people in charge has caused the Houston facility 5 accounts. The new GM has no clue to how previous people uncharged have destroyed the name RRD
bad,They do not pay enough for the amount of work that they demand from you. The company does not provide any proper processes or management structure. The benefits are the worst.
bad,I cant really answer this question due to I i am not understanding the reasoning behind the fixation of RR Donnelly.  I worked there and that is all I can say.
bad,"In my experience;"
bad,"Job is horrible, they lie on what they want you to do, do not work there. No match for 401k, no bonus, no Christmas bonus, just a horrible place. Also employees or good people, management is garbage."
bad,This is a horrible company to work for they care about there employees health.  They take your payment from you. They work you like a dog where I almost passed out they wouldn't let me go home.
bad,My manager was 100% checked out. Spent zero time with me. Very unethical behavior. The team was not open to new members. Pretty disappointing career move on my part.
bad,"Indeed won't let me post how it actually was. All I can say is, if you have other options, take them. The management is reactive and punitive and all they care about is how many hours you work. Not what you can get done in the hours you are there."
bad,"Worked as a Legal Word Processor & proofreader.  Low pay compared to in-house legal word processor at a law firm. Poor management, favoritism shown towards the most inept incompetent workers. Annual reviews were almost non-existent and when they were given they were very late. Very unprofessional staff and poor work environment with rude belligerent employees. Low morale and toxic work place.  High turn over and extremely under staffed. This company DO NOT care for their employees. Would not recommend working here!!!"
bad,"We only work 8 hours this Friday, management expects us to rejoice for this! They are even kind enough to give us the day off on the corporately mandated weekly outage. Don't worry though, they won't punish us with time off though, next week we will be working long hours and through the weekend. They are also kind enough to let us work for less money than everything else around here so we can rejoice knowing the office staff can buy nicer things."
bad,Management sucks. Lack of communication.  Work is ok. People make it hard to work there. Too much OT.  It's become a ghost town/sinking ship. Pay is horrible.
bad,Not a good company to work for.  Too demand and not enough pay.  Benefits are OK - health insurance too costly.  If you are married and have other benefits it may work out.  The nigh scheduled is convenient for those who have to work nights.
bad,I lost my job there due to destroying there competition and after spending millions on updates and paid more for medical coverage . Also very chaotic environment and bad management the place I work was bought out and closed permanently thanks to being a bigger company with more money to blow employees don't mean a thing to them it's all about the money lack of decent breaks
bad,Deixou 970 funcionarios na rua sem pagar os direitos trabalhistas
bad,"Empresa Americana com mais de 25 anos de atuação no Brasil, encerrou suas atividades neste ultimo dia 01/04/19, sem o menor respeito e consideração com seus colaboradores, sendo esse um dos princípios que a empresa pregava ""Respeito""."
bad,"Toxic  environment. Nothing but high school gossip and drama. HORRIBLE management who have no idea how to perform the tasks of those below them let alone their own duties. Even worse, management  love to blame and point fingers for mistakes and go as far as seeking out reasons to terminate individuals if they so desire. Favoritism is rampant. If you are someone who needs FMLA they will look and find means to terminate you. HR works in favor of the company, going to HR with any issue will be turned around on you. If you still wish to work here, keep your head down, mouth shut, and just meet daily duties."
bad,"Expectations way too high for very little pay, then when work loads are exceeded with current personnel they won't hire additional help. It's like working for Pharaoh in Egypt, "
bad,Not a great place to work. Management is far removed and the atmosphere and corporate culture does not foster growth. Find another company to work for!
bad,"Pay raises are a joke. In the last 8 years the company has given 1 percent raises to employees across the board. Thats 8 total percent in 8 years. While upper management has taken 10 percent raises or more each year. No benefits whatsoever , 401k program is a joke. No match plus whatever you put in actually goes down each month in value. You would think you were working for a company in another country."
bad,Communication is very lacking starting with supervisors on up to management. You are just expected to know what to do and once you do it if it is incorrect then you get in trouble but if things had been communicated better issues would never occur.
bad,"Dangerous and no training: HR had me sign a document that STATED I was not trained properly however I was supposed to function as ""part of the crew"" -Safety Coordinator"
bad,If you want to ruin your marriage this is the place to work. Your husband will bag every hooker he can. And if your wife works there well their aint to any good men out there so your safe unless she a hoe.
bad,The person training me had no patience and wouldn't answer any questions i had about the position.  I talked with the manager and supervisor and nothing was done.  I decided to look for something else.
bad,"Everything that could be terrible about a company is wrapped up in this horrible place except for working with a few good co-workers. It's not just in Phoenix but all over the globe. I'm sure this company is on the way out established for many years or not."
bad,"Only care about numbers. Don't care about safety or their crew. When safety issues brought to light, it takes far too long to tend to. Injury or illnesses basically dismissed."
bad,"The place is made up marshmallows and sweet on the outside, once you work there it’s a dive. Poor management, no opportunity...nothing"
bad,"In last year they close one of 3 facilities and employe workers again and again and fired them before 3 months."
bad,Too many Mexicans in there that do not speak English so it will be hard for you to learn any machine and in my eyes that is a safety hazard when you do not speak Spanish the government needs to really go through their company to see who has their green card
bad,"the worst training i have ever encountered 20 year employees counldt train a dog to sit, health insurance choices the worst. Clicky family employees, dad, mom son and daughter type of clicky. they dont like outsiders and give you addditude and no help if you ask."
bad,"Too many hours not enough work.we would be standing around for hours doing nothing. I was a book picker, I worked in quality control and I was also a person who would make sure I find the missing books too"
bad,Management at this location are horrible.  No use in lodging complaints. No one cares. No one listens. Co workers aren't that bad. But even then. The union reps don't do anything but gossip. the pay is bad for the job. From what I've seen not a good place for females to work.
bad,"Sometimes if there was enough work we would be sent home early. if there was too much work we would not receive our lunch time. There was a fair amount of favoritism with the supervisors in terms of who they picked on and rushed to work hard, in comparison to some people standing around and doing nothing."
bad,"The opportunities there were few and far between, management had no control of their workers. it was un professional and dirty at times."
bad,Expectations were not clearly articulated to employees. RR Donnelley managers operate unethically and lied on a number of occasions. Do not work here.
bad,I will never work for the location ever again. only a 20 minute lunch and a 10 minute break. the managers do not care about you in anyway. might be the worst place I ever worked at.
bad,"GREED RUNS THIS COMPANY.."
bad,Not a good place to work. There  are very little advancements there unless you are cool with the higher management. This is just a job that doesn't pay well.
bad,0 to 0.1% wage increase over the last several; years.  No incentive.  No cost of living. . No 401k match.  Benefits rated among the worst in the county.  Poor moral
bad,Horrible!  Lack of structure and positive management.  Managers did not care about employees.  Extremely high turnover.  Did not appreciate the good employees.
bad,"No Typical day. Learned about problems with the system. No day was predictable - poorly managed, poor benefits. Bad communications within company. Poor corporate management"
bad,"You'll be busting your hump working here for sure for very low pay, considering this is a Fortune 500 company."
bad,"I have found a career that has helped me get me where I am at today.  No, it is not a perfect job.  There are many stresses during a given day. During the busiest days a day does not seem to end going to a fro getting material, setting up machines, changing product on machines, and getting completed product off, verify that it is correct and shipping it out. Hours can be to many and days off too few, but for me the extra money was helpful.   The culture of the workplace does need improvement in investing in their employees, machines, building, and corporate structure.  I have learned to work with many people with diverse personalities and how to appreciate everyone for their strengths."
bad,"Benefits, job security and advancement poor, Compensation and benefits horrible.  Very difficult to speak with manager.  Most of the time very unprofessional.  Overtime was always limited to some and to others overtime everyday no questions asked......."
bad,RR Donnelly was a very bad bay place to work for. Stay away from this place. They favor minorities like Mexicans and asians.Not given enough time for training. Arrogant attitude . Management treated me like garbage. Bottom line only counts for these people. Shady outfit.
bad,I would never want to work here again. I worked at this company for well over 6 months and my small daughter became very ill and was in the hospital and I brought a doctor note and was fired for missing 2 days of work to be with my child because they said they did not except doctors notes.
bad,No transparency and communication from top down. The company has no identity or direction and customers hate working with us. Most employees very unhappy. Benefits are pathetic. Not a bright future for RRD
bad,"Management does not want to take the time to fix any issues.They won't take any suggestions. Ideas are shot down before they are even tested. The office people, and the production workers can't seem to get along."
bad,A typical day at RR Donnelley is very stressful. There was continuous rumors being spread by HR. Management was very poor. I would not recommend to anyone! They overwork employees and focus them to work overtime.
bad,"management needs more training in the positions they hold. they play favorites always. there are some motivated workers there, but a lot of people there just putting in their time to receive the pay.they also have some good operators."
bad,"About all I know about the company as a whole; they sign the paychecks. They do not communicate in any meaningful or consistent way with their embedded employees. I wouldn't know management if they sat next to me and I certainly don't know what they do, how they impact my life or vice versa."
bad,This started out to be a great place but after 5 years the environment changed.  Overtime was always a must and you were always changing shifts.  the CEO was a piece of work.  Never in my life had a CEO say he looked for employees that were dirt poor and heavily in debt.
bad,The management has no structure. It's almost impossible to advance there. The work is simple but management makes it harder then it should be. It's sales based.
bad,"I worked for RR Donnelley for a short time, but in that time I was overworked, belittled, and unnecessarily challenged. The ability to come in early and leave early were perks, but the perks stop there."
bad,Pushed boxes in truck. Loaded truck with boxes and made walls with boxes.Learned some jobs are just not fair.The hardest part of the job was the amount of work they put on a person.The was no enjoyable part.
bad,"Don’t work here unless you have absolutely no choice. No prospects, no job satisfaction, dead end bored out of my mind job with hideous colleagues stuck in 1970’s politically incorrect attitudes"
bad,Has to be the most unreliable company I've ever worked with. The way this company pays is crazy! They short you on your hours and expect you to work and drive 14hr days. They give u half a weeks checks and give you the other half another week late! Stay away from this place.ive warned you!!
bad,"Long hours and underpaid. poor management, unorganized, overall it is a bad place to work. no paid holidays, and no breaks except lunch. would not work there again."
bad,"Very stressful company to work with. Lots of favoritism, management is not well trained.  Not a good company to work with, please move on, don't apply here."
bad,"If you like to go to work everyday doing the same thing everyday for 12 hours a day then this job is for you. It's noisy, machines shut down once a day"
bad,A corporate monster which will treat you like a number and does nothing creatively. You constantly feel like you will be cut. A half aass ad agency of the new age bent on world domination.
bad,"long hours stressfull no company 401k match poor benefits, no aperation for employees,low mor all becouse of long time employees leaving for mutch better jobs past several years 1%raises cant keep new employees eather."
bad,Bad management supervisors are rude not fair to other people as far as trying to get in the company wouldn't recommend anybody to work there. Very hit turnover rate.
bad,"RRD use to be a great place to work, but now it is not.  They basically took everything away and don't care about their employees. I wouldn't recommend anyone to work there."
bad,Management is chaotic. Co-workers are cut-throat.  What clique you belong to is more important than work product in document processing area. Your job will be outsourced to India and management will lie while it is happening. Equipment is outdated and not repaired. HR is severly dysfunctional and doesn't care. This company is stretched to the limit and it shows in how they treat their employees.
bad,Filling up machine with pages of books. Put books into boxes according each customer.Pile down books or cartons of books not pallets. Put proper paperwork onto loads going to shipping department.
bad,Very bad place to work if you want to advance within a company. They choose favorites. Supervisors of each department are nice. Head Office manager and overall supervisor are rude and have no compassion for employees and do not know how to run a business. RRD does not give raises or a adequate bonus for the work done.  Overall bad company.
bad,"Toxic work environment, poor management, and one of the cheapest companies to work for. Horrible benefits and very low moral. Most workers are overworked, underpaid, and disrespected."
bad,"If you need a job quick and are willing to work like a horse for minimum wage for hours upon hours a day, with ungrateful and poor management, knowing there is no advancement and no pay increases then this is the place for you"
bad,"i worked there 5-6 years and so many managment changes, your like a puppet on a string, old equipment , the only time it gets fixed is when broke down and cant run, bust tail to get a yearly 1% pay raise a year"
bad,"the people don't try to train you for much of anything,. they dont give a hoot about their temps, all they want is your work and then they will fire you when they are done with you"
bad,"unaffordable and poor quality health insurance"
bad,ok company corporate headquarters in Chicago hr manager in Chicago worthless  another company that does not care about any employee everyone just a number
bad,"this place is terrible never try to get a job here, they don't care about anybody except themselves. it pays is to low for what you have to do so don't go there"
bad,The atmosphere is very cold and unprofessional. I experienced discrimination and was treated with disrespect.  Management are not supportive and their is a spirit of fear that's in the air.
bad,"Sweat shop.  Low pay, no advancement, terrible atmosphere. Mandatory overtime every week. Management is terrible. Bosses don't even speak to you. Only 1% pay increases every year no matter how good or bad an employee is."
bad,"Don't expect adults to work with, worse of everything exist throughout the entire company. go find work elsewhere. this is a dead end job"
bad,"Way too much BS, run like crazy from this company,  they'll will work you like a dog overtime and everything, then send you home and make you lose one or two days. Management uses your co workers to harass those they don't want in the plant.  They will put negative comments on your credit history as type of worker,  devil runs this place just say.  Retired Veteran. ...."
bad,"Horrible management teams and terrible benefits $4,500 deductible with $6.5K out of pocket max. .   Multi million dollar company can't even afford to match 401K for their employees.  Very sad place to work,  No moral boosts, seems like we take one step forward and 15 steps back on all old fashioned ""upgrades"" they do.  Web site is not user friendly, management does not listen to suggestions on how to win more sales and marketing team is sub par.   Communication is a huge issue here on top of it all."
bad,"If you like having to go to work in an environment like high school , RRD Liberty is for you. It's not what you know , it's who you know at the Liberty , Mo facility. Complete with an inept HR department, this plant will have you at your wits end trying to figure out what exactly it wants from you. Competent at your job? Doesn't matter , because your immediate supervisor probably has no idea how to do your job and never actually worked in that department before. So if you don't act like they are your best friend and rub their egos from time to time you will not last. You will be expected to work no matter what is going on at home as well , they are very efficient in systematically eliminating you with bogus write ups to cover their rears from wrongful termination lawsuits , so if you take too much FMLA they will just get rid of you . There is no one working there that has taken FMLA time off and stays . Stagnant wage levels from 2005 , no 401k match , and no real bonus incentive plan , if your lucky and haven't been written up 65 times to disqualify you,  you can get a 1% payout based on your gross . Horrible health coverage that increases premiums and decreases coverages every year . Run from this company like the zombie plague ."
bad,"Work too many hours, not enough time off. Scheduled 12 days on, 2 days off. Hostile work environment with poor management. Monkey see monkey do training. Only offer very expensive health benefits, no retirement match or pension. Moral is way down, nobody wants to work here with no incentives."
bad,"I worked here for a long time and never really got anywhere. This place is full of favoritism and there is absolutely no work/life balance. If you do happen to get to be a machine operator, you're stuck on 2nd or 3rd shift until someone retires which could be 30 years so you miss you children's entire lives!"
bad,If You have a job. Don't look here. It is a dying company and yer long term employment is for certain if you like very low pay and no benefits. They will lie to you and tell you all about advancement and comprehensive benefits that only benefit the company.
bad,"RR Donnelley is a typical greedy company. "
bad,"No job security, managers do not care about employees. Big bosses come in and walk over you like you are a bug to them. I would not even give them a half a star."
bad,"I worked there for more than a year."
bad,"This company has known for many years that paper advertising is soon to be a thing of the past and therefor, the co. won't put any money back into maintenance of the equipment. We actually used duct tape and wires sometimes, no kidding! The turnover rate is atrocious so we were always training people, and don't expect to be rewarded for your hard work, we were lucky to get 1% a year(equal to .12 CENTS) It's a four crew shift, work 3 days 1 week, and 4 the next, but you can't move up, out, or over if you don't work 7 days a week. Every 6 to 8 weeks you also have to flop shifts, meaning for 2 months you might be on 1st, then get bumped to 3rd's. Used to have good breaks and benefits, those are gone."
bad,"Worked at DLS Drugs and Alcohol was brought in daily.  Owner and Mgr knew of this, but didn't care. Wife handled payroll-snob!"
bad,"ualifications "
bad,"A normal day at RR donnelley is sitting in the lunch room for hours waiting for someone to come get you for work. It's like prison!  Big bosses say or mentioned said you cannot have pop on the floor but all the hugeeeeee ladies get to enjoy it. And the ladies wash their feet in the bathrooms. Nope not joking I saw it! And the greatest part is your told last mintue your working a Saturday and Sunday with no warning on friday nights! So basically  if you have a family or spouse run don't work here.. i never saw mine.  Not worth 9 dollars an hour!!"
bad,"I have worked for this company for over 20 years as a print and mail production Supervisor and at the beginning (Working for another company before they sold the print production off) it was a pleasant place to work.  The pay was great, staff morale was at all time high, benefits were great, excelant bonus schemes, managers who treated staff with respect and they got that back and it was nice to go to work. Now the management (who have never been on any courses on how to manage staff) have zero respect for all their staff and no man management skills, no bonus schemes, no benefits, morale couldn’t get any lower but management don’t seem to care about the staff any more. Instead of trying to motivate staff one of their favourite quotes is “If you don’t like it leave”. If this company is still running in 5 years time I will be very surprised. Unless there are big changes soon I don’t think the staff would care too much if they closed the doors. If you are looking for a job and get offered the chance to work here my advice would be DONT TAKE IT!!!"
bad,I have a great time working at this place knowing there more then one things to do and learn. This job was a fast pace for me and yet kept me busy. This was the job from a temp that want me to learn more things then other temps did know to get hire on after so many hours.
bad,A typical day is to get started on what is taken over from the other shift and what they have not done and finish it.Then get started for your shift and make sure everything is going good and the parts are doing good and passable.i hated working seven days a week and not having a lunch break.
bad,"Company is killing the print market and doing just enough to keep the equipment running so there is no opportunities to reinvestment money into the facilities, equipment or employees."
bad,"Worst company I ever worked for in my life. Management doesn't care about anything or anyone after RRD took over from what use to be Banta the location I worked at the job security and benefits for the most part including decent health insurance no longer exist. You never know from one day to the next if you have a job or its just another layoff, if your looking for a secure job that provides you a living wage and reliable health coverage I don't recommend applying here you will not find it."
bad,"This was similar to a warehouse job where i was pick packing the boxes and load it to a van. •It Involved working in a team processing customer orders of contact lens. Duties included printing order details from computers and then picking, packaging, scanning of contact lens boxes and then inputting of data and cross checking if correct and dispatching them"
bad,RR Donnelley does not care about advancing your career and has bad management. Stay away. There is no 401k match anymore.
bad,"Misleading during the placement process, low pay and high expectations to start. Once at the client site and have learned the role, RRD then steps in and ask you to do a bunch of mandatory items on their end.....its like working for two companies instead of the client.  RRD also micro manages and write you up for any thing that you do not report wrong or incorrect to them. RRD also loves to seem like they are running the show instead of showing unity and compassion. If I could give them no stars it still would be too much. They wasted months of my time and I would never recommend them to anyone.  30 minute lunch and long hours...You would surely have to be desperate to work for them after reading this review."
bad,"I had no training, management didn't have a training program, nor handbook with rules in it.  Everything was so called verbal.  I was harassed inappropriately by men, and had to sit in an office that smelled of illegal drugs when management knew of it.  Wasn't paid ontime either."
bad,You never know if you are working 8 or 12 hour shift.  Your schedule is on a day to day basis so there is no way to make any plans outside of work.  Rules change like the wind to benefit the company. Raises are a joke.  Most people have received approx. 10 cents max a year and that is if they don't find reason to not give you one.  If you have a job related accident you will be written up and not be eligible for raise or job advancement for at least a year.
bad,not enough hours they give other worker more hours than me because they speak Spanish and i don't they need to be more fair in handling that.
bad,"Unfortunately the warehouse atmosphere for this company is very, very poor. I started as a mail sweeper and was able to become a light machine operator shortly after starting. It's sad they require you to work 6 days per week, vacation does not kick until 6 months after starting and they pay so little . I work with a group of people who could care less about doing a good job. They are careless.  The company gets what they pay for. If you want a high quality of work, you have to be willing to pay a fair and reasonable wage and as ar as I can tell they want to maximize profit, instead of doing quality work."
bad,"NA...I dont really have anything to say, my ratings should explain it all. Training is the worst ever, if you even get any training. They do not fire people for anything, so you are stuck working with people that you can not rely on."
bad,"DO not work for RR Donnelley, over worked, constant forced overtime. constantly put down, racist management. Never allowed to take vacation."
bad,Organization is impossible to move up. Work product is stripped from employees and no advancement opportunities exist. Most engineers I worked with had same positions for more than 15 years with little to no pay increases or bonuses
bad,"I have worked at RR Donnelley for a year. They do NOT follow OSHA rules. It took them 2 years just to have a walk way for pedestrians to avoid accidents by forklifts. They are very unorganized and uneducated when it come to a logistics company. They have no proper training. Coordinators and leads have no communication skills, very disrespectful, and are not professional. They throw you in a position and expect you to know what your doing and if you fail, expect to be disrespected and cussed at. Managers and supervisors talk behind each others back to employees. They discriminate and show favoritism to employees as well. There is no chance of moving up in this company its all about who you know and what friends you make. Shipping department is the worst. The office can not be ran properly with the supervisor and operation manager in place. Shipping supervisor is always not at work, leaves early and takes credit for other employees hard work. Operational manager is always sick. Facility manager is clueless about running logistics. HR is NEVER present and definitely shows favoritism. Nothing is shipped on time. And the customer is also frustrating. Customer has to micromanage everything because RR Donnelley cannot run the process properly. Expect to work 6-7 days a week because of upper management  mistakes. Assembly department doesn't even run off the same system the entire building runs on, and shipping there work is a joke. They do not properly label and package pallets correctly. They manually keep track of pallets, which cause lots of human errors (always losing customer product)."
bad,I enjoy helping the employees with health benefits and FMLA and working with vendors and contractors.  I enjoy working with the employees.  I enjoy setting up for customers and meeting people's needs.
bad,"not good place to work,  work to much// You dont get to spend time with your family."
bad,"It was good doing something other than what I was normally doing. But new management came in and started micromanaging. I couldn't see myself working here, because I couldn't advance. A lot of favoritism, and alot of discriminating.  They have their picks and chooses on who they want to have a lead job. A lot of people has quit within the last month due to new management.  Coordinators don't have communication skills and always having attitudes.  You'll never know what you're going to walk into.  Prepared to work long hours. 12 or 10 hours days."
bad,"If you like sweat, tears, and dirt this is the place for you.  Everyday you are elbow deep in ink to make the perfect magazine that no one will see.  This is not a very satisfying place to work."
bad,"it was very stressfull and very hot place to work, I was very dipleased"
bad,Must be able and willing to work 12 hour shifts every day of the week.
bad,"The Right Tool for the Right Job?"
bad,$8.00/hr is not worth the standing and monotonous work they require.
bad,This company will say it's number one resource are the people. When push comes to shove the people are no more than a number. Each month when financials were down the reduction of headcount was the first course of action. They are in the business of eliminating jobs and then try and hire individuals back at a much less rate of compensation.  They continue to buy out smaller companies redistribute usable assets and eliminate jobs. The management team is expected to work ridiculous hours and the compensation is less in comparison to other companies. The discussion of compensation is totally frowned upon. Yearly surveys are conducted with repeat issues brought forward regarding upper management with no changes. Spent 20 years working under Standard Register before being purchased by RRD and spending the last 12 years with RRD. Standard Register treats their associated so much better and I would suggest to all to stay as far away from RRD as possible. No matter what they say they care nothing about those that bring in the profits.
bad,they over worked the temporary workers. the supervisors would give the temporary workers the jobs that the full time employees were supposed to do.
bad,"Stay away... you are treated as a number, not a person. It's all about cost control and you will be held accountable for any errors in order to make the bosses look better."
bad,"Shut down and sent our jobs to China and Mexico, leving me in the predicament I am in now!"
bad,"management is a joke, conceded,short sighted, untruthful and color blind. if you have a clue what you are doing, your a threat. watch your back and cover your butt your coworkers will get you. and don't plan a life your on call 24/7.H.R. is there to protect management and not help employees. best just to stay clear of this place. "
bad,"stand on your feet for 8 hrs on floors with mats that are worn out, if your back, feet or legs hurt your not allowed to lean on tables, or walk away and stretch due to you have to keep the line going and very fast pace, needs better management, most co workers are great,most enjoyable part was some of the people i worked with, its kind of a who you know kind of place as far as what you can or cant do unless you are considered a minority"
bad,"Preparing plan year end summary package was my work it was helpful for the internal auditors.i learned many things such as computer skills, knowledge of auditing,finance,accounts.manage was really good for my personal and career development.my coworkers was so good and helpful and most supporting persons.i love my job so i enjoy doing my work.i don't find any hard part in my job because i love doing my job."
bad,"have been in printing 33 years not a good or safe place to work .Plant a mess jury rig everything ,run too failure not safe to work at sorry to say but that is the truth!!!!!"
bad,This was the most stressful and unpleasant work environment in my entire career. In addition their business practices were unethical.
bad,I worked there for 22 years and after all is said and done I wish I hadn't. There is nothing good to say about this company. HR and management were a joke. Unfair to everyone that wasn't in their click. It makes me ill thinking that I was there for that long.
bad,Not a very good place to work.
bad,"I was there in the Willard, Ohio division for 7 years. I have NEVER worked in such a horrible place before! To them, you are only a number. There are very poor raises (if any at all), benifits are horrendous ($650 a mth for insurance!). When asked to be trained at a different job, they laugh in your face. Nobody keeps to themselves and does their job because the supervisors have turned everybody against each other! You are rewarded for that! All they preach about is safety, but, if they can get away with having 3 less on the line... They will and if you hurt yourself trying to keep up while you are 3 people short- you are fired! If you ask for a day off, they act like it is a sin. When you tell them that you are looking for another job, they laugh at you and say where are you gonna get a job at? I have never seen a company so poorly managed before! There aren't 10 people in that whole plant that likes it because of being treated so poorly. Did I mention, they don't offer a pension plan? The One reason why most were staying there, they threw out! There really is nothing good I can say about this place beside- I know WHY I left and I know WHY I will NEVER go back to working for them!"
bad,if you like to stand at one place for 8 hours and do the same thing over and over then this jobs for you.
bad,was a wonderful place to work until takeover by Moore wallace
bad,"Work expectations are unreasonable as each IT programmer is responsible for up to 30 systems with on call responsibility 24/7/365, including holidays and vacations. No rewards other than gaining a better understanding of office politics."
bad,If you expect pay raises for hard work. Yeah no 1%a year is nothing. This isn't the place for you. You get lots of days off by working 12 hour shifts is a plus but yet they will constantly want you to come in your days off but yet when it's time to ask for a raise. Sorry can't do anything for ya. I could go on and on but it's just terrible. In a nutshell management does not care about their employees.
bad,"This review could be a novel but I'' summarize with abusive management team, HR will not help you, the company will not protect you, and if you get injured they will do whatever they can to get you to leave quietly. Do yourself a favor and avoid them at all costs."
bad,It’s a good place to start at if you have zero experience. But definitely not a place you want to work at for the rest of your life. They promise growth but there’s no opportunities given. Sadly management wasn’t the greatest.
bad,"Never in my career in this industry have I seen such poor leadership at every level, but especially at the upper most levels. Communication is NOT king. Employees are not treated well and it’s more like a totalitarian state than an environment where employees can advance, thrive in and desire to do a better job. It’s like no one cares.."
bad,This place offers no advancement opportunities at all. People have worked in their positions for over 17 years and no promotion or anything is offered. There are no woman in management at all only a HR manager. This place needs to be under investigation.
bad,"Horrible morale, all monetary benefits have been taken away (profit share, pension, 401k match, holiday bonus), 12 hour shifts, equipment not well maintained, management seems uncaring."
bad,"Benefits are no good. Maybe starting in a different industry is best. Facts are facts, and over the past 6 years RR Donnelley has taken away profit sharing, taken away company 401k match, and employee appreciation is down from no Christmas gift cards no bonuses and so on."
bad,"Management does not care about you, your thoughts or anything positive you bring to the table.  The controller is does not care about what a real manager should do and how they should handle their subordinates.  There are tons of opportunity to improve department but they don't care.  Process improvement is just something that gets in the way of some one-off duty that becomes so important."
bad,I've never worked for a more dishonest and untrustworthy company I've never known a company to treat it's workers so badly and they're expectations of work are so high for what is effectively minimum wage
bad,"Terrible place to work. You start out as a temp and then cross your fingers hoping they will hire you full time. There are some temps who have been there almost four years and they still have their fingers crossed. If the floor supervisors decide they don't like you, then you might as well go out and slit your wrists because there is no way you will ever get hired and they go out of their way to make life miserable. Job is qualmetrics orientated. If you exceed the goal, you get dished on by the supervisors because they feel you are a threat to their position. If you don't meet the goal, you get dished on by the floor supervisors because they are just want to be as mean as they can be. There is a lot of back-biting to management, and drama. Things no one needs in their life or have to put up with from anyone. (Especially ""professionals."") Don't stop here, keep looking!"
bad,The industry is struggling and so is management. Benefits are all but stripped away year after year and policies change per person. Management rushes you when you're not happy and refuse to help make a better work environment for their employees. With an average 30% employment turn around rate people come and go. I don't blame them. There is NO room for advancement here.
bad,No office culture. Not one team meeting in 2 years. I have no idea what my objectives even were or what the company mission statement is or was. Nightmare!
bad,Most of the workers at this plant are over worked and under paid. Management is very unfair and unprofessional. On a typical day most of the workers work 12 hours and there is no unity what so ever. A lot of the employees have been employed here for 10 years or more with no advancement to managers or anywhere. They remain put throughout their tenure.
bad,"very bad management, do not care about there employees.  there is no advancement. poor work ethics. they do not hire from within. no cost of living raises."
bad,"Accounting management is not run effectively, leaders has a no people skills, The culture is the bully mentality. they have not compassion. at time it can become an hostile environment, with lots of verbal  abuse, and no one around seems to do anything about it. including HR, & VP that are only a few doors down. they make employees feel as though this something you should just get used to ,it normal & that your the problem or at fault. there not training just assume how thing should be done. if you looking to grow with in your career this is not the place to work no advancement."
bad,"Very poor managers.  They are simply put in place without training. Very unethical.  Corporate HR has no idea what happens outside the corporate location.  If you bring an issue up, you manager looks for retaliation.  No respect between co-workers.  It is not unusual to have a co-work screaming profanity inches from your face and yet nothing is done."
bad,"Paid salary and spent more time than desired beyond regular hours working to complete tasks.  Studio manager was intolerant and did not appreciate extra work done and approving overtime."
bad,management is oh alright.  Nice job.  stacking boxes on skids .   scanning boxes and envelopes.  waiting for trucks.   I learned nothing.  Workplaces culture is oh okay.
bad,"Bad management/ HR, 1% cost of living only given out by favoritism, too many forced 12 hour shifts, work is easy, lower paid employees often lazy and cry babies"
bad,"worst run facility I ever been a part of. No advancement opportunities, no 401k match. bad benefits. hire anyone. I think its a dying business. bad business"
bad,"As a 3rd year employee I've never seen a company that makes so much money treat their employees like dirt, from heat exhaustion cases to begging for bathroom breaks or a strict policy on talking to other co workers. If you want to be treated unfairly or talked to in a manner that will provoke you then this is the place to work at!"
bad,"If you want a job that pays well, in an industry with a definite shelf life this is the place for you."
bad,"Machinery falling apart, no maintenance to keep machines running correctly.........All they want is production, even with the machinery falling apart............ Nobody in supervisory positions listening"
bad,this place was a joke to work for.management had no clue.invertory all screwed up.could not get good lift operator last a week hitting rack.the racking was put up new can't tell now
bad,"My ""office"" is an improperly heated/cooled box where I am forced to wear a coat and scarf all day long during the cold weather. Job during the busy season requires overtime hours, but am told not to work overtime - and if I do, I have to take comp time instead of making the extra money. Management style here is ""my way or the highway"" and no room for any advancement. Raises are once a year and everyone, regardless of quality of job performance receives across the board 1%. Had to fight for even a space heater and sufficient lighting out in the yard where we have to be after dark and am scoffed at for complaining."
bad,"A typical day consisted of packing junk mail."
bad,"I'm an account/project manager that manages the production of various magazine titles through the production process in order to maintain schedules and meet deadlines."
bad,Hours were flexible here (for the most part). It was nice to be able to be home before 4pm on a daily basis. More time to spend with the family in the evening and also beat a lot of the rush hour.
bad,"This place cares nothing about it's employees.  Only getting their product out of the door. You don't have a work schedule. They inform you day to day if you have to work  mandatory 8, 10 or 12 hrs. They DO enforce their attendance policy. So, needless to say, they have a huge turnover rate."
bad,"Ever since i worked at rr donelley the company has been taking away from the employees, ( such as pension 401k match). the benifits are horrible, i pay a high premium for it to cover barely anything."
bad,"This job is like a jail you work 12 hours almost everyday all week two weekends a month on top of military *if you are military* you get two whole days off a month and you are always working/sleeping it's turn over ratio is terrible as well. The benefits are being taken away supervisors get a bonus every year while the employees get nothing at all safety is a joke."
bad,"A day at Rr Donnelly would be over working, staying 12-14 hour days 7days a week without notice. Filling out vacation sheets just to get a break from long hours only to be denied. The hardest part of the job is the low pay. The best part of the job is your co -workers."
bad,"Everything about our company fell apart. Our insurance went throw the roof, we were no longer allowed to do fundraisers for people who were ill or injuried and trying to pay their premiums while out, it just became sad. More work, less people, moral at all time low!!!"
bad,"Chybí informace o normách, jejich plnění - asi je to tajné. Neřekli mi to ani když jsem byla na ""koberečku"" u personalistky a vedoucího skladu. Jen mi sdělili kritiku hlavní mistrové, že jsem hrozně pomalá a musím zrychlit. To je jako kdyby řekli na závodech účastníkovi v běhu, že bude utíkat, ale neřekli mu, jak daleko má běžet a jaký čas musí splnit. Zásadní informace o provozu a normách jsem se postupně dozvídala až od spolupracovnic v průběhu pracovní doby! Práce je sice lehká, manuální, ale celou 8h. nebo dokonce 12h. pracovní dobu probíhá ve stoje - po pár hodinách nevíte, jak si máte stoupnout, bolest za krkem, v zádech, ztuhlé celé tělo. Práce neustále ve stresu, který přetrvává i během 10' pauzy dop. a jen 20' pauzy na oběd v místní kantýně, kde je fronta i 8'. Šatny bez lavice, jen pár židlí, úzká ulička mezi skřínkami - ke své se nedostanete, když je tam víc kolegyň!"
bad,"Favoritism"
bad,"Worst company I have ever worked for. No support, no progression and thrown in at the deep end. I do not recommend RRD at all, avoid at all costs! It's a blame culture and throw the 'new one' under the bus. Terrible work culture and no solidarity, management lie constantly and have 'secret meetings,'"
bad,Need to trig better the workers is a lot of raices there and preferences need better aministrations and beter supervisor they are so thesrispelfull ext
bad,"Really like the type of work I do. HOWEVER., there is not enough staff, so I work 9-11 hours a day during the week and 1-6 hours a day on weekends - no overtime pay since I am salaried.  Many of the people I work/speak with at the plant and in estimating are hard to work with because they are so unhappy.  no team spirit, no engagement, no collaboration.  Coworkers want me to take on tasks that are part of their job accountability. And they get mean spirited when everything doesn’t go their way. Looking for another position but there isn’t a lot of opportunity in printing.  WOULD BE GREAT IF RRD DID SOME EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT WORK.  Too many angry people."
bad,"Poor management, toxic culture, terrible morale, poor training are just a few examples of why this company is not a place I would recommend to anyone."
bad,"Can’t be 1 minute late or get an occurance which add up quick and can get you fired. No lunch breaks only 3 ten minute breaks on a 8 hr shift, or 3 15 minute breaks on a 12 hr shift. Management is all brand new as all other management has left for greener pastures.  Very nice people to work with. Everyone that has left has said the only thing they will miss is the coworkers. Best part of your job is who you work with. Other than that it’s like being in jail."
bad,"called on a load, and they sold it right from under my nose, Very Professional , NOT!, they wouldn't even add 50 bucks even thou the load required tarping really goes to show you how these cheapskate company operates."
bad,"Stressful, the corrdinator played favorites and if you weren't one of them, then you got bullied by her. asked her a question and she didn't know the answer herself because she didn't know what the job pertained to in each area. Management is horrible because none of them have any experience.All they do is sit at the desk and talk about people. The most enjoyable part was working with some awesome people and becoming great friends with them."
bad,"They claim to inforce safety regulations for all (ie. Shirts tucked in, earplugs, absolutely no cellphone use). Apparently rules don't apply to everyone. There are many who seem to escape these rules while others are written up for it. Machines are old and rigged to work, not properly fixed. No real work/life balance. It's ok if you want to be a workaholic."
bad,Job is a joke. Typical day at work is long and boring . Especially when ur doing the same thing over and over. No career advancement and favoritism is a number one thing at this place. If they have a job opening that they know u are qualified for they will choose a temp over u..managment is no good. They could care less about u or what u have to do in your personal life doc app school ect . expect nothing out of this job except a paycheck..
bad,"Don’t work here. You are not valued, high turn over, health benefits are so expensive you can’t afford them have to buy cheap mn care. Forget about decent pto  prorated first two years you will be lucky to get 5 days, you are expected to come to work regardless of how sick you are!"
bad,"They prefer no hire no experience temps instead of qualified candidates in order to save money, quality sucks. Management bottom of the barrel, only 1 great manager there. President cares about no one but him self. I would rather be homeless then have to work there ever again."
bad,"A typical day at work: Inventing ways to break down all of the internal RRD barriers in order to meet the client needs."
bad,"If you just need a quick easy job over the summer this place is fine to work at, however there's limited opportunity to advance. They hire more work release employees than anything else and consequently it effects the environment."
bad,Very tense and stressful place to work.  I was a temp in this receiving position. I was lied to in the interview from day one.  I was training to work 2nd shift. I had no idea. Also ppl watching you like a hawk !  Management very unprofessional
bad,"Was a good place to work when hired, but went down hill over the years. Corporate Management did not care about staff in the end. Outsourcing and regular layoffs became the normal mode of operation until we were shut down altogether."
bad,Not a good place to work unless your staying at home with parents or a young person coming out of high school. When i work there i had the weekends off. Thats the only good about working there.
bad,They are only hiring and firing temps so that they can pay workers less then if they were hired on.  You will be blamed for problems the bad machinery creates. Plenty more can be said but I'm not trying to ruin their company.
bad,Benefits keep reducing and pay increases do not keep up with inflation. Long hours are required and work life balance means nothing to them. You are treated like a number not a human being by management.
bad,"The printing company is a dying field.  The company is shutting down plants every year leaving employees wondering who will be next.  Poor benefits, little to no cost of living raises."
bad,Management did not train or give proper input. And were very Unprofessional. Majority of the team could be described as Mean Girls. Some would talk down about you pretty much in your face. They would ignore you and or not talk to you (therefore you wouldn't get trained). Favoritism was very apparent.
bad,that company will hire any idiot to do a job. they treat their intelligent employees like animals while the idiots are treated like so called family...................
bad,"Terrible management and HR. Employees are treated terribly.  Executives had no idea of how to do the work and the time necessary to complete jobs.  As a result, set unrealistic deliverable time lines and lost a lot of clients."
bad,"I worked with a lot of great people. However, the management is horrible. They treat the employees like garbage. If you ever have a problem with a PC or supervisor HR will always side with them not the employee regardless of the proof or documentation. They are very  passive and racist. If you're not white you will be singled out, given the worst jobs. Management will complain to other employees (their friends/favorites) about people they don't like. . Benefits are the worst in Cache Valley. Local fast food and department stores have better insurance.  Mandatory overtime monthly with little regard to family/personal life. Holidays off unless it falls on your scheduled workday. They expect work to come first at all times. This is for all departments. AVOID working here at all cost"
bad,"I worked there for a very short time, the reason being, the work is not only hard, but it is in no way worth the pay. I worked just as hard as everyone else but only received 7.25 an hour while everyone around me was making 10+"
bad,"Stressful workplace no life balance, company is structure is very poor manage, management is bad no opportunity for advancement within. Will never work for a such company like this again."
bad,"Literally the worst experience I've ever had. 12 hour shifts with one 30 minute break. Ridiculous! The most depressing atmosphere, employees look beaten into submission. Its no surprise with the kind of management that's there. The supervisors are unapproachable, they have the attitude of a sweat shop manager. Low pay considering the amount of hours you work. Some employees consistently have to work 20 plus hours of overtime to make ends meet. No real family life. Do not work here!"
bad,"Never sure of exactly what is expected, As for being understanding regarding family, they were great, Benefits were HORRIBLE, It would have been nice to have gotten better training and support from management."
bad,I worked for RRD for 9 years. Six of those years there was a salary freeze. Company bars unions from entering. Pension taken away. Dismal health benefits. Overbearing and over intrusive management. I picked up a paycheck but was miserable there.
bad,"Working for this company is absolutely awful! management is never around to help, talk about coworkers in spanish.Very physical job with very little pay."
bad,"My review is good about the RR Donnelley. "
bad,"I tried to fit in to this company and the extremely long tenured staff, but did not have any support from management so making the needed changes was completely out of the question."
bad,"no other comments,they use a point system for you attendance and "
bad,"This is definitely the worst admin asst job I've ever had!!  There is very rarely any work to do and when you do have something, their systems don't work...constant error messages!!  The atmosphere is extremely depressing.  Your stuck in what used to be a storage room and you can't bring anything into the room, no purse, cell phone, notebooks, magazines, you name it!  You can't even have a wastebasket at your desk.  You are not allowed to have or use a printer or copier, which makes it very difficult to do some of the work required.  No training, extremely small raises. There are SO many restrictions and they don't care at all about their employees!  For instance, on Admin Asst day we didn't even get an acknowledgement of the day...not a word!  If you need supplies, you're pretty much on your own.  They don't want to spend ANY money on their employees.  The turnover is ridiculous for obvious reasons.  We call the new people their 'next victims'! Please heed my warning and stay clear of this place at all costs!!!"
bad,"After working at RR Donnelley for over 10 years the company (at least the plant I work at) has gone down hill rapidly over the last 3 years. We used to have a schedule that allowed us to have a life outside of the job but now with 10 hour shifts and working every weekend makes life outside hard. I no longer have time with my family and hate working at RRD now. In addition, the company is splitting into 3 companies and that could be good or bad or the same. The benefits are expensive right now I pay over $500 every 2 weeks for the highest paying insurance that may change after the split (at least we can hope)."
bad,"Strict work place with an unsupportive management."
bad,"Typical day was just a regular manufacturing job, except you HAD to work 12 days in a row and then get a two day break. You got most major holidays off."
bad,"Worst Managent "
bad,Outsourced and in place with a law firm. Terrible business model for RRD but awesome from the clients point of view. Too few people for too much work with no overlap in staffing. one person per shift.
bad,"Work is easy, plenty of breaks. Pay is decent, although not keeping up with Cost of Living. People teach and mentor others well. Most enjoyable is working with the people. The hardest part of the job is dealing with management. They are biased and prejudice, not race wise just who they want to befriend. What goes for one person is not the same as what goes for everyone."
bad,Prepress manager can not be trusted to tell the truth.
bad,"RR Donnelley's in Mattoon has had one of the worst reputations for a place to work. Lots of overtime. High divorce rates. No retirement now. Management looks at you as a number not a name. Very hot, dirty, long hours. If you have a lot of years in, be careful they will fire you for the smallest infraction to get someone else in cheaper. Most of the entry level help they get are dirt bags. On one line there were 2 people with ankle bracelets on because they are on probation or have been in trouble with the law. You can imagine what kind of help they are on the line. The safety is pathetic. Lots of injury's due to long hours, repetitive motions, and the hard concrete. 25 years ago it was a pretty good place to work with great pay, benefits, double time for overtime, the front office people knew you by your first name. Now it is the total opposite. Do yourself a favor, and DO NOT GO TO WORK HERE!!!!!!!!!!! You WILL be sorry!!!!!!!!!!"
bad,Long stress filled days were bearable because of the support of co- workers.
bad,They work 12 days straight no double time. If you aren't Hispanic they don't care about you. This place has no training I pretty much trained myself and no advancement. Union shop with no union benefits pay sucks
bad,"Worked second shift in prepress.  After leaving a couple shifts with a migraine, I inquired from HR about sick time. I was informed there was none. NONE. "
bad,"It is a revolving door of employees. This company cannot find or keep good help. The employees they do have who are competent, they let go of. Absolutely not loyalty to the workers  who have devoted themselves to the company. There are also too many criminals there."
bad,"RRD does not follow any of its strict guidelines and annual tests that it gives its employees. Manager has no experience in the field of advertising/marketing. You as a designer are never given a chance to voice your opinion even when you are right. Too much drama within the workplace that creates unnecessary & a uncomfortable environment. Project Managers bicker and argue among one another to see who can be better than the other, which creates issues with the job. Your talent is never showcased. They rather favor those they like within the business."
bad,"This job forever turned me off to factory jobs. Out of nowhere they announce a shut down. Since I was not there for a year yet I was of the first to get the boot. No severance pay or anything those that did get severance pay, they got 1 week of pay for every year they were with company (old man gene was only one who walked out on top because he was in his 70s and been there since high school). The problem was inept taking up to management about how much we were scrapping and wasting valuable resources but they refused to hear any of it."
bad,"This place is run by total idiots that have no idea on how to operate the machines but will say they can. "
bad,"Management is terrible, manipulative, and tells lies when it fits them. The work is simple and the co-workers are nice, but having to play the corporate game is exhausting and soul-sucking. Watch your back."
bad,"Management would set unrealistic goals for the work they expected. Would also micromanage. Supervisors played favorites, lazy workers were rewarded while the hard workers w were treated like bad. God forbid you have a medical condition, they would punish you for that on top of telling everyone that you are lying about having a medical condition regardless of all the Doctors notes and diagnoses. Very stressful environment."
bad,Use to be a good place to work for until change of management and buy outs . Moral is very low and employees are stressed and overworked.
bad,"I would be hard presses to work there again. they only garnet 20 hrs a week, but then required mandatory 8 hour Saturdays at straight time. They are always threatening you with your job."
bad,"RRD is one of the worst jobs you can have. There is so much favoritism that you can't advance unless you kiss someones butt. If you mess up at all, that dis qualifies you for a year. Their management is horrible and will lie right to your face. I worked there 6 years with 1 advancement because I wasn't a ""favorite"". There are FAR better jobs out there."
bad,"RR Donnelley was a great place to work until the mergers started in 2004. After that its been constant cuts in benefits, training and no chance for advancement. Print as a whole is shrinking."
bad,"I don't think its their fault, print is a tough business.  Some great people work at RRD, not sure about future prospects there due to obvious reason."
bad,"RR Donnelley bought out the company I worked for, drove our plant straight into the ground, stole our customer base, and shuttered the facility, putting 260 people out of work."
bad,Floor supervisor did not care about his employees and threatened to fire people on an almost daily basis. Overtime was not optional either and you could end up staying 3 hours over and coming in 3 hours early the next day without warning.
bad,"This company can turn a 20 year old person into a 60 year old quick. They have too many job responsibilities per person. I know that sounds like whining but the technicians are getting shorted on people to an extent that they are having to do the material handlers job just to keep the line running as fast as supervisors want. They don't get maintenance time so lines go down a lot more and instead of preventing things it ends up breaking and being down a lot longer. Never was a fan of swing shift especially swinging every 6 weeks. 12 hour days are ridiculous. Especially when you are in there on night shift when time changes and it goes back an hour, that's a 13 hour shift for ya. It is very hard work."
bad,"Worked for RRD for 20 years.  Used to be a great company to work for, but management started bleeding the company dry and started at the bottom of the ladder, of course.  In the bindery you only got off every other weekend and even that was not guaranteed. The pay was very good compared to other manufacturing jobs in the area, but they put a freeze on wages because they had to pinch every penny.  The benefits used to be great with pension and 401k match and nice health options.  That all went away.  The work itself really wasn't that bad, until management started micromanaging everything and breathing down your neck.. treating you like you didn't know how to do your job after 2 decades.  In the end, I can only say that the people were why I stayed so long, because they were like family.  But now they are all gone too due to lay offs, firings and the smart ones that left, so now I really have nothing positive to say."
bad,This place is very descriminatory. If you are not white there is no hope for you. There are two bldgs one majority white it is clean the air works. The one bldg the minaroity work at is like an outhouse. HR overlooks all compliants from the employees unless they are white. they pay you well below demographic pay scale.  The phillapinos are very much misstreated.
bad,"the co-worker there are very hard worker's I really enjoy working with a lot of them,"
bad,"A typical day at work means I would have to check my schedule and ensure I am all geared up for the training session at hand, with the required handouts and exercises. This also entails me to ensure training rooms are booked ahead of my sessions through coordinating with the room booking team. I may have to attend meetings either face-to-face or through a tele-conference call to update my boss about the past and future schedules."
bad,I worked for this company for over ten years. They do not appreciate their employees at all. It's based on the good ole boy system. As long as your part of the in crowd your gold. Management within this division is a joke. I would not recommend this place for employment to anyone. Long hours. Filthy facility.
bad,I am legally obligated to only say that “I was treated fairly by R. R. Donnelley.” and so that is what I’m going to say and nothing else at all. That’s it
bad,"I started as a folder operator and moved my way up to Supervisor, which I enjoyed due to the fact that I enjoy bindery work. The company fired several Supervisors and I was forced to run all the departments (Plant Manager) for the same pay. I did it until I found employment elsewhere. Not a good place to work"
bad,"Poor Management"
bad,Management was a joke. Very unorganized and although politics are not supposed to be talked about in the work place they consistently showed their stances. It is all about who you are friends with there. Favoritism plays a huge role in your growth here. If you are a fast worker they will throw everything at you while others do nothing all day. If you complain to HR they will just tell the supervisors and nothing will be rectified.
bad,The job is very fast paced and super stressful. You’re lucky if you get half of your breaks and the unpaid lunch is very hard to get as well. I do not recommend this job or work place if you want to have any sort of a life!  Only pro about this job is that there is a ton of opportunity for overtime if you need money.
bad,"I tell everyone not to go here if they can help it. It's either feast or famine. You get a ridiculous amount of OT where you only have 1 day off in 2 weeks or get laid off for 2 weeks, but have to call every day to check. The culture of the place is toxic. There are people who get a pass to abuse you because you are lower on the totem pole than them."
bad,The entrance area was trashed when I first got there. There was condiments is what it appeared to be all over the walls there bathrooms were nasty and to me it was unprofessional.
bad,"Health insurance out of pocket cost is insane. It's disaster insurance at best. You are required to wear steel toes on concrete floors so at some point you'll need to have surgery to correct the bad feet, bad back, bad knees, hips, shoulders etc. that are caused by the job after a year or so.  They do not pay for this,  you do.    Want to go to school? They won't work with you.  They have 13 different shifts and all of them are odd hours that make no sense. Shift changes twice a year and the ones who've been there longest get first pick so you don't know if you're going to be able to keep the shift that comes closest to working with your life.  Mandatory OT is commonplace here.  Raises?  What raises? "
bad,"Wonderful people working there but this location was a depressing one.  There was no positive feedback and training and re-enforcement of values, processes where negligible.  The pay was not at a level the position should receive."
bad,"The work culture in this company accounting department  is terrible. Five Turnovers in the same department in lest than a year. Office space is antique, dirty  and depressing.  Manager and supervisor scream and curse from office to office in the presence of the HR and Operation Manager. Management do not live by the example create rules and they never follow it.  No room for grow and poor leadership skills. One way communication.  PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM THIS ACCOUNTING DEPARTMENT."
bad,"A typical day involves no direction but the expectation is that you just automatically know what needs to be done, where to find the forms or what ever you need at that time. "
bad,I have been in this industry for a long time and it is time for me to utilize my strong C-Level relationships to help other organizations accomplish their goals.
bad,It's a corrupt and disputing place. All about favorites and they work I like your not human full time or temp please if you value your marriage your health and your morals do not work there
bad,"Terrible place to work, the 1% raises you get will not keep you ahead of inflation, & the insurance is high. You are expected to work mandatory overtime, so you can't plan anything on your days off because you don't know what days you will have off. They are cutting back so sometimes you are doing the work of two people. You swing shifts every 6 weeks, and there aren't any benefits to make this job worth your while."
bad,"get to work and do my daily duties. "
bad,"Back stabbing, Everyone is for themselves. Poor leadership, unqualified personnel, unsociable and unfriendly environment, no solutions, lazy leadership. Absolutely no support. In my 34 years of being in the printing industry I have never seen such a free for all. This is a dreadful place to work at. RR Donnelley's  is to lower the floor instead of raising the ceiling in order to make non experienced people on the same level as well educated and experienced people. This place is only good for the inexperienced people that wish to be an $9.00 an hour operator with a dime increase a year. The leadership is inexperienced and cannot ever help because the knowledge is not there. Don't even try to learn on your own or they will back stab you or try to set you up as a failure. There is no communication in this plant between the management and supervisors. They can't crew a line. Everyday they have 18 - 45 minutes of down time at the start of a shift because the supervisors let the temp service crew the lines. How hard is it to tell people what line to be at the day before? One would think after about 5 years the supervisors would catch on. They just don't get it because they hire supervisor that previously worked at the burger shop and the can't see what they are inadequate at. This place will dummy down the most intelligent person. No solutions, no ideas. Never changing. The lose around 3,500 to 5,000 books per day per line that doesn't get in the mail. It's a poor operation that doesn't want to improve. The idea of comingling mail for a discount is a great ideal but, they dump money"
bad,its a nice company to work for they for. they give you proper breaks for  working 12 hrs on your feet.
bad,Not a horrible place to work but pay for the amount of work and physical labor that you do. Its also hard to get the management to address problems with co-workers. I wouldnt recommend a job here.
bad,They don't care about the people who work....the ones that show up and do their job.  They reward those who don't know the job and don't want to learn and always find a place to hide when the work needs done.
bad,"they always hated when i had to go away for military duty. they also refused to offer me a job because of that reason, but they wont admit it beause theyd look bad"
bad,"Management is terrible. Mangers tend to get involved personally with employees. I am a firm believer, that doing the job, I was hired for, their is no need to suck up. Managers like taking personal advantage of this. Pay rates for increase was based on suck up."
bad,I loved my job a few months ago but they have a way of taking your joy. they are sexist ands treat women poorly and no advancement opportunities for women
bad,Management is too laid back. Which made workers lazy the entire work schedule. You only get 1% raise every year no matter what. They refused to give you a decent 401k and they dont match your IRA. Bad company and the management is racist.
bad,"Poor benefits, corporate bureaucracy and a leadership team prone to group think keep this company stuck in a strategy that ignores the real business issue holding back corporate performance."
bad,No middle management. Upper management does not handle employee issues on the floor very well. Management wants jobs completed in timely manner but does nothing to combat lazy employees that only want to work at their pace. Very old equipment with no plans to update. Incoming work and work hours diminishing rapidly.
bad,"I worked at the RR Donnelly in Bolingbrook, IL. and I was in the carrier sales department. My immediate manager was a horrible example of a ""boss."" He played the favoritism game. He preferred 2 women in our department over the rest of us. We are supposed to find carriers to cover our loads at the lowest rate possible. He whispered better rates to these 2 women so that they could cover the load before anyone else so that they were paid out more commission. "
bad,I would not suggest this place for an employer due to the lack of benefits and the dwindling of jobs from the lack of business from paper books. The company has recently sold to LSC and gotten worse and is slowly going out of business and ding off.
bad,You went in and went at a dead run all day. I felt like I was working like a dog. You couldn't wait to get a break. They gave you more machines then you could take care of. You had to swing shifts  and sometimes work 12 hours 6 days a week. I always said it was a young persons job but it was to hard for an older person. Management was ok but they had their favorites. I didn't like anything about the job it was picking up 30 lbs bundles and feeding the machines for 12 hours a day.
bad,A day at work i would get there punch in at my machine get it started to run the 8 hours see what we are my operate and i are running for that day lots of time it is it is just a 1 operate and materiel handler 1 and that me. i get my cartons ready to pack the product in it as it come off the end of the line why operate is at the other end running it.
bad,It's a good job just bad training and lazy supervisors. You'll be loading trucks and scanning mail. Stacking pallets and pushing the lines and checking the weight
bad,"Co workers made it fun at times, but also at times made it feel like highschool. The opportunity to learn and move up is good and they are willing to cross train you at that hourly wage"
bad,I had long days. It was the hardest job I ever had. The co-workers were great.
bad,Printing is a dying industry and I do not suggest working here fulltime unless you just got of prison and need a fresh start. Worked long hours and missed a lot of breaks at this job.
bad,You can get a lot of stress the rules and the police is really bad the supervisor treat you like little kids everybody's lying the rule is only for one type of workers
bad,I was a temp for 6 years been working there for 8 years some people were nice if they were having a good day if they weren't it was hard to work with them. Management let other employees yell ad curse at other employees and temps. They treat temps really bad. Overall they people made it a bad place to work.
bad,8 hours not aloud to go outside no formal breaks . and work was so slow never broke a sweat . very long day . was a real challenge to stay busy enough to pass the time . steel toe boots required along with ear plugs  .
bad,Low pay and long shifts with nothing to do but clean if the press is down. The work is also mind numbingly boring. Coworkers are ok just watch your back because they love to talk smack about anyone.
bad,Sem comentários empresa que faliu e deixou vários trabalhadores desempregados .
bad,They hardly know English and then treat you like your the outsider.....Horrible. I don't recommend it .The supervisor talks down to the employees.Just a horrible experience far most the worst place I've ever worked.
bad,"The clients are lied to. The morale is low. There are favorites because of family ties. "
bad,Underpaid poor management.management don’t care about their drivers if your not related or one of the favourites.They will lie to you or just tell you what you what to hear.
bad,Bosses arent up to par on any kind of harassment issues.paid lunch is nice and the insurance is good. Chain of command is a joke and the general policies are just not what they should be.
bad,Would not recommend for anyone to work here. I had medical issues with notes to take medical leave and they still fired me but there are other people that can miss when they want and there were no consequences it was all about who you knew in the plant.
bad,"once your there for a short time, the job is easy. but it is all repetative work. management needs more training and acountability for their  actions."
bad,a doomed industry [ print ] in the final death throes of its life.shareholders and upper management  siphoning all they can at the expense of employees to get  a golden parachute before it all implodes.
bad,Very sloppy work there they do not know how to run a warehouse. They need better leadership and work skills. I just wish they would have a better system.
bad,"being laid off and leaving co workers.  the plant closed.  there were workers that worked there all their life, including whole families.  The plant closed down entirely in 2011."
bad,"No managers able to commit to people but only to profit. People are paid overtimes but they are also expect to work long hours. Poor office conditions (not working air-con, heat during summer)"
bad,Easy job fast paced environment picking and collating orders replenishing stock load and unload truck and general housekeeping in a warehouse setting
bad,"The day at work is fast paced. I learned about their process of saddle stitching booklets is different than what I learned in college. The management is not the greatest. The co-workers are excellent."
bad,A typical day was coming into work in a unwanted work environment. I didn't like that job really and i wouldn't go back if  could.
bad,The management  for this company shows no compassion or respect for their employees.  They see them as just another piece of machinery and show no compassion towards an individual who is having problems or has special needs while at work.
bad,"Keep non-payroll supply budgets logs and balance store checkbook; review seasonal payroll/non-payroll budgets"
bad,"Sorry to see that RR Donnelley closed our plant in Westford."
bad,"The best day I ever had at work was at Jack n the box where they did a Christmas Party.Even though we had too work after that cherishable moment, we still found the spirit too give to each other. When I look back on that day, I could see the those ppl wasnt just my co worker, they were more like a family...so that what we were...because we work together and its no team like a family team"
bad,"Good, decent folk, lots of over time if you go for it. The cafe is nice, but be careful at ""The Wheel of Death"". Staff is good too, I sold books from both ""City Hare"" and ""The Planet"" there on the floor."
bad,"Awful management, poor pay, bad health benefit.  I would not recommend working at this company.  I was not happy there.  Outdated decor.  I would not recommend working there.  It was a printing  company that was losing business."
bad,This company has been struggling and has changed owners multiple times. The benefits have went downhill with the stock.  The equipment is outdated and also their safety procedures such as LOTO are non existent.
bad,"The reality of the matter is, this type of company is not for everyone. If someone needed a job and would be willing to tolerate unsuitable working conditions. RR Donnelly is for you."
bad,I don't like working every Saturday.Some people get wrote up for coming back 1 minute late from break or lunch while others do not which is not fair.you will be told not to take lunch at all some days and work late but the company do not pay for lunch and you still work.
bad,There was so much drama in this workplace that I felt like I was in high school again. I cannot handle people who are lazy and run their mouths. It isn't fair to work for so less but work your tail off.
bad,"The supervisors favor to many of their click."
bad,One word: Horrible. This companies HR could possibly be the worst in NY. They have no support for the workers. I could go on but you dont have enough space in this square.
bad,It was very hard to get promoted. The people and Management made it hard to do the job. They don't pay enough and the benefits were not so great
bad,"Does not meet my expectations of job role, money and career progress."
bad,High stress long hours Be Perfect or do not go!  Several nice employees.  Paper industry is a dying breed.  Maybe okay for a stepping stone for two years.
bad,The only thing that was nice there were the coworkers.  The culture was nonexistent as well.  Management was not the best at listening to the needs of employees.
bad,Lol  nice to start but not at all a company to work for if you are not family to them they are very one sided and will blame anything on anyone but them selves
bad,"Favoritism, management sucks, the supervisor would physically tell you. This company is no good, no good benefits. Pay is not fair for everything that is worked."
bad,"Management let some of the employees run the company.  If you were not in their click you were rarely noticed.  A normal day is generally 12 hours, and you got your breaks and lunch as the press operator saw fit.  Hardest part of my job is trying to get others to see that they should clean as they go.  That no one was there to clean up after them."
bad,"I worked for RR Donnelley for a year in a half, saw a lot of changes and learned a lot of what not to do in a position such as this. This was my first inside sales job and it was a fun,exciting but also stressful experience. Seeing as this was a start up with in the company there were a lot of changes and very hard to know the direction the company was going in. After being there 9 months a lot of people began to quit and management began to leave as well. I overall had a pretty bad experience with sales here because there was no real training program to help coach and develop."
bad,"You are expected to be available for work anytime during shift meaning most days, there are no lunches or breaks allowed."
bad,"not enough care put into the employees creating negative environment throughout facility, not given the supplies necessary to help team succeed so set up for failure, simply budgeting for more tape guns for example would even make a great difference but time after time order request were rejected for something so simple but expected to be used by employees at a warehouse, right? poor understanding of what is needed to make the work flow."
bad,Was a good place in the 80s and early 90s after that it was all downhill.  You went from personnel knowing you name when you walked in to H.R. asking what is your number?
bad,Their  management is not good. The supervisor are not trained very well. Instructions are never clear. They give  you enough information to make a mistake. Then ask why!
bad,I just don't want a temp job. I want a career. The job was fine it's just you will never move up in the company. I was there a year and I can't even get a car.
bad,Organization lacks experienced and competent leaders to manage the company and its employees. This is the same old fashioned BPO style that requires their employees to just work and work.
bad,Management changed so much and not for the good. People were given management roles that had no clue as to what or how to treat and deal with employees. Always being careful and observant of other employees. Lots of backstabbing and he said she said nonsense.
bad,"Management only communicated when something was done incorrectly, no recognition for hard work at all. No work/life balance whatsoever. I would not suggest working for this company."
bad,not a great place at all.  worked for 10 years with nothing to show.  pay was horrible.  management was horrible.  everything was not organized and dirty.
bad,I liked working for this company it was fast paced environment consistent work paper machine never stop running it was a good​ experience to work for them
bad,"Work is what you make it. The job is not difficult and as long as you are self motivated, you will accomplish a lot. I learned most of what I know by seeking out the information. Their training is less that adequate. Management does not have any idea what they are doing. Mostly, they are a bunch of guys walking around talking about how great they are. Then gathering in groups in corners and isles to laugh about some incident they encountered while at work or to talk about their wives, kids, farms, or the ""hot chick"" doing the hearing test. Co workers are a hit and miss. It strongly depends on the crew. One crew is hard working, accomplishing a lot with the young/new workers. Two of the crews are predominately lazy and filled with people who have been there a long time and do not care about anything but getting paid. The last crew has many workers who know what they are doing, and produce when they want to. They are also a bunch of troublemakers who care more about gossip and who their next conquest is than about producing forms. There are good people on all the crews, but, what I described is the overall attitude of each crew. The hardest part of the job is getting through a shift without dealing with drama not related to the job. Also, shift are difficult. They are 12 hours on your feet. Nights are exceptionally horrible. The most enjoyable part for me was my co workers overall. I was on the best crew in my opinion. There were dedicated people who cared about doing their job. Cared about their performance. Good people who felt everyone deserved to be treated fairly! Too bad"
bad,Lots of drama and back stabbing. Doing a good job compensates you the same as the guy not doing his job at all. Management gives no support; sink or swim mentality. No manual to follow so everyone does the same job duty differently. Lack of communication. Everyone on the defense and will complain to anyone but you if they have an issue. You will have no personal life because you work holidays and weekends
bad,"This company started out well upon my presence, then became a ""take away the benefits"" company that were helpful at my hire. I would ""never again"" bring any of my followers, to seek employment with this company. Savage management, lean workers, do more with less, and no growth in ones salary. Poor place for moral!"
bad,"Very poor management and supervisors throughout the company. The employees are just a number and nothing more. They expect you to do the job of 3 people in an 8 hour day. "
bad,They don't care for the employee and there home life.  They are more concerned for there pockets getting bigger and employees get cuts in the paychecks.
bad,"an ok place to work, temporary status, hire-on is rare, a good experience to see all of the shipping and receiving processes"
bad,"Was not informed right up front that I would be a temp for 3 yrs,before I would be able to try for full time. At 10an hour I would have never started ."
bad,This company is good to work for. You will get a lot of experience.
bad,"The company focused on volume vs quality, both aspects of the job are important . The system was a nightmare, the volume expectation was not realistic based on the systems ability to process and accept the information that's required to complete the overall required task."
bad,I loved working with my co-workers
bad,"Wonderful people to work with, the Company does not offer much in compensation, advancement or benefits.  Printing is a mature business and the Clients are decreasing due to electronic communication."
bad,"Working at RRDonnelley is no fun much less rewarding. Those who really work hard may get a yearly pay raise if his or her manager is a good one, otherwise you've got to be from Mumbai to be recognized. People management leaves much to be desired especially since the head of the department is not from the Philippines who hardly knows our laws and people."
bad,"Poor management. Wants you to hand over your book of business, meanwhile all the other reps have a book of business built off of other being fired and leaving their clients behind. Absolutely no synergy in the office. No flatbed experience. Will screw you out of your margin just to keep company revenue and when it comes down to it. Your job will be on the line. Just a terrible atmosphere, lazy carrier reps."
bad,"I liked the people that I worked with.did not care for 3rd shift."
bad,nobody in the managerial positions care. be prepared to work saturdays and sundays and 12 hour days. also some holidays. if they let you off on a holiday that falls on a weekend be prepared to work the next weekend !do not recommend this company!
bad,When I started out there I did enjoy working there. It did teach me digital printing. The problems came in with new management on 2014. Morale went down and people were treated like machines.  Work/ life balance is non existent too. We were on rotating 12 hour days towards the end and we weren’t allowed to have chairs to sit down in our department. It’s gotten worse since I left.
bad,"Almost the last man standing in a dieing industry."
bad,It was a Strange place to work.  Too heavy in managers.  Too many meetings. Just too many layers of people.  The building I worked at was not properly taken care of
bad,Wasn't a very happy place to work.   Hard getting help.  My programming experience was in accounting.  RR Donnelly is a printing facility.  I wasn't given the chance to work with someone to get to know the system
bad,"Constant change involving production workers. management constantly changing priorities and expectations of completed work, unrealistic. Inexperience at entry level management"
bad,The company gives no direction on where it is heading. Stock prices have dropped tremendously and people are getting fired after working over 20 years with the company. The benefits get worse every year and you only get a 1% raise per year. Convoluted computer systems- you have to go into different programs just to get an order placed. It's not a fun place to work any more.
bad,"This is a company that is on it's way out. It runs the best it can to stay afloat but in an age of digital media, I would not recommend this for new workers."
bad,Company had department work long hours without time off; compensation was low; little or no merit increases given for staff employees.  Many assignments were ambiguous in nature.  Management very hands off with staff---senior execs not very approachable.
bad,"Hostile work environment. Same pay scale since 1980 per long term employees. Staff shortages - be prepared to have ""other responsibilities"" due to staff shortage."
bad,"RRD is so big that you are a number, not a real person whose livelihood is ever taken into consideration by upper management.   RRD does not care about their employees nor do they give back to their employees or show any level of appreciation.  "
bad,"typical day is oh ok and other days are fast.   I learned some things.  management is ok.  workplace culture is oh alright.  hardest part of job is delivering truck.  most enjoyable part of Job is talking to girls,"
bad,"Decent company to work for, pay is okay depending on the position.  No benefits.  Seasonal overtime and is sometimes feast or famine.  Not a bad place to get your feet wet."
bad,"This place was the worst job I've ever had, they fire you for no reason with no rehire. I was laid off and I'm not eligible for rehire which makes no sense to me at all."
bad,They have stripped away all forms of benefits beside health insurance and vacation time. In regards to health insurance it covers nothing and for vacation time you pretty much have to beg to take one. There is absolutely NO worklife balance as it is seven days a week. Forget advancing to anything unless you can kiss enough behind and are generally the laziest thing in the plant. Management is beyond a bad joke that keeps getting repeated on a daily basis. The equipment is junk and not  person in corp wants to fix anything.
bad,No employee satisfaction. Bad management. No growth and bad hikes. They do not value employee. Do not appreciate hard work. Do not sanction leaves even for emergencies.
bad,"Poor benefits, every time I turn around there is talk of another benefit going away.  Too many frustrated burned out employees.  People leaving the company in droves.  Will start many people as a temp, advertise the position as temp to perm and then cut them loose as soon as work slows down."
bad,"Management does not hold anyone accountable and is very closed minded.  Management has no regard for outside life, they expect to work overtime but cry when you want or have to leave early."
bad,RR Donnelley is a nice job to work at providing you can keep to yourself and just do your job but like all jobs things happens you just have to work through them and keep your head up. lot of
bad,"SENIOR BUSINESS ANALYST"
bad,"Uma empresa Dinâmica e agradável de trabalhar."
bad,"R. R. Donnelley is an old Chicago company with a checkered history dealing with labor. R. R. Donnelley in Texas, a ""Right to Work"" State is like a kid in a candy store. They see ""Right to Work"" as ""Right to Exploit"" and they do. Just in my 8 years here they have ceased the pension plan, halted the employer contribution to the 401k, halted promotion from within (current employees must apply for a higher postion, just like people who are not employees), started 1% raises across the board, awarded a profit sharing number so low as to be insulting, eliminated the Christmas bonus, and cut hours during slow periods. Middle management are clueless about anything except self-preservation. Upper management are just bean counters. One day they will find themselves in the position of needing some loyal employees, and there won't be any."
bad,"a day starts at 7am and ends at 7pm the runs are short but to be expected in the short run platform. The condtions in the plant are hot if you are not up for the heat this is not the job for you. After 7 years of employment i have seen a steady decline in the engagement with managment. it used to be a careing family of people working together for the common good. Now its a corporate run facility with corporate constructs the careing is gone. The pay has always been the one good point giving people something to hold onto, with advancment opportunity being good the best part og the job has always been the people you work with."
bad,I was through a temp service for 4 years and still didnt get hired or get a raise
bad,This job offers a great variety of  information on various SEC regulatory filings. Continuous learning opportunity.
bad,what you learned
bad,A usual day at work I stand in one spot for a period of time and put parts into a kit. It would be much better if we would have mats that wouldn't hurt our feet while working. Only good about RR Donnelley is the people I work with.
bad,"Scheduled for West Coast time zone, I came in at 11am and was immediately thrust into customer service calls and meetings for East Coast clients with little to no preparation. I learned graphics and how to use Quark Express and In Design. Most co-workers were great, very dedicated. Lots of over-time after late and incomplete specifications from customers. Last minute changes while on the press. Redo work after completion led to printing errors. Writes people up for mistakes caused working excessive overtime on late incomplete orders. Like that fixes it. Always looking for ways to cut the people that verify the instructions on the orders are correct. Poor benefit package. Only a $7000 deductible health plan is paid for by the company, you pay for the rest. Option to pay for better plans at your expense. Unreal amount of overtime and on call pay on weekends provided some big paychecks."
bad,"Reports, staffing, problem resolution, Returns"
bad,"Twelve hour shifts working as hard and fast as you can go, coming home with ink all over you, was a typical day at R. R. D."
bad,I'd rather not say. There was poor morale throughout the entire facility.
bad,"Not only did they start outsourcing work to India and laid off almost all production employees, they also pay the workers in India next to nothing and paid the same wage when they came here to train."
bad,Good job but no overtime pay sometime the  Communication is not their over all great people but the pay is not the best  And they don’t pay overtime which is a bad thing races are not the greatest either you get 1 percent a year... this sucks
bad,"Stuck in its antiquated procedures this company struggles to implement a modern training system. Most users don't utilize the services but a few times a year, in that time they frequently forget how the system works. I offered to create a video on demand section of our help page that captures step by step videos. It was ignored to keep mangers traveling on the company expense to supplement the training. No clear understanding of the product or systems was gained by the client(s) at any point."
bad,"If there is nothing else, if you are a felon, if you just need a entry level job and some quick cash this could be for you. Many many nights where you dont move and you just stand for ten hours with a short half hour break for lunch. Turnover is ungodly high because the job is so boring an repetitive and low paid. Target pays more kwik trip pays more arbys pays about the same. Basically this job is for kids who need to see what a terrible job is like or a criminal with no prospects or ability to gain good employment."
bad,"Lack of leadership skills certain leads. Lots of favoritism. Families working together, when its strictly stated no family member.. you can get fired and rehired if you are family.."
bad,only 1% raise annually that it what a joke.no co. match to 401k medical insurance its getting worst management no people skills.rarely promote within .dont follow SOP at times no job posting.
bad,The pay is very low. You only get a one percent raise a year. For most it's 10 cents a year. Definitely not a cost of living raise. You work alot of hours. Never know what hours you are going to work.
bad,This company treats its employees like dogs. The pay is nice but the benefits are expensive and not that great. Management needs a lot of work. Shift hours were based on seniority so even after nearly 13 years I was still on 3rd shift with zero hope for first shift opportunities.
bad,As to the facility I was at 90% of the people were temp`s and the company also used a great deal of outside contractors. I had little cooperation from the supervisory persons at the shift I was assigned.
bad,management was bad felt like i was being picked on all the time. I was hired to be a forklift driver and became the wrapper which was extremely tedious work for what they pay
bad,"No hay buena paga y beneficios ,ni bonos al año el Break de lunch es de 20 minutos y las troces son viejos para trabajar dan mucho problema los truces"
bad,"The benefits and salary were OK, but they got worse every year as the benefits increased the raised were one percent or none at all for five years in a row."
bad,"This place is not a very good place to work at. People there like to take advantage of minority’s. They like to work people to the bone, but all the managements and Crew lead just stands there and watch"
bad,"Its  printing and manufacturing company, with a very busy and fast working environment with lots of overtime, working on most of the weekends as well."
bad,"Work 12 days in a row and 2 days off all the time. Pay isn't bad, but the insurance is OUTRAGEOUS and the deductible is unreasonably high. For instance a deductible for family is $9,500. However I have made some great friends while I have been there. Breaks are 2 15 min breaks before lunch 30 min (unpaid) lunch and 1 15 min break after lunch. It is swing shift work. Most of your supervisors will work with you if you are a good employee."
bad,almost every machine would break down quite a bit. you were locked in a building anywhere from 8-12 hrs and they would literly call you off over half the month
bad,Very stressful and cut throat. You as a CSR had to follow up will all departments with your jobs. If a department was late is was your fault. Not the manager of the department fault.
bad,"They wear you out with unnecessary training classes. They take forever and way to many interviews to make a decision to hire. They postpone your start date several times. They have so many irrelevant HR training courses etc. that are a total waste of energy and time. Management doesn't stand behind its people. It just blames them. They have the same expectations for revenue and profit generation for every market. Someone in a smaller market is expected to generate the same profit and revenue as someone in NYC, Boston etc. Overall a bad experience. They bait and switch you on so many things."
bad,"The hardest part-time job not use to labor jobs. But  i learn how to sort mails, data input, package and load. And meet some new friends. The night supervisor was cool very helpful."
bad,Basically it's a State-Side Sweatshop that pays low salaries. Even worse it's a call center environment. You are micro managed and don't think about being 5 mins late even if you got stuck in traffic.
bad,"RRD is an average company to work for, I worked 60+ hours per week. The base pay was not good. However we are paid overtime. we were under paid and over worked with no appreciation.."
bad,"I enjoy what I do, the problem is the facility is far & the pay does not out weight the amount of traveling I need to do to get to my office.  My position does not allow me to work from home & I'm not permitted to answer any emails after hours even though I have remote access to my emails."
bad,The company runs way too lean.  Attempts to make financial numbers by work force reduction of employees.  Remaining employees take on many more additional responsibilities with no additional compensation and still expected to meet all deadlines.  No training for additional tasks given to the remaining employees.
bad,"Senior Management spends more time on the golf course and in the bar, than in the office."
bad,"Good starting point for our career .gives a kick start for our job, there is no job security so people jump from this company to their desired company"
bad,"You have to run up and down the isle chasing the mail, putting it in it's correct bin, don't drop it or let it overflow as u collect or the machine will mess up, and lift the heavy bin for the guys to put a sleeve on it."
bad,Poor Leadership with very little incentive/rewards to want to promote or remain with RRD.  1% annual pay increases is very sad considering what leadership roles earn annually
bad,Very easy work and somewhat easy to advance but horrible place to work if you have a family you like to be with and the worst management I've ever experienced.
bad,No Job security. The employees have very low moral. The benefits are not good. the supervisors and managers are very unprofessional. Raises are nearly impossible to receive.
bad,my typical day the workers and supervisors would talk badly about one and another. No one would do their jobs. I only learned to be organized at my workstation. Hardest part of my job was not wanting to go to work because everyone would treat you badly. Their was nothing enjoyable about working here.
bad,"RRD was like walking into a dungeon. They switch shifts every six weeks; six weeks on days, six weeks on evenings, six weeks on nights, and repeat. Some management was difficult to work with."
bad,"You never know if you're gonna work full weeks can not"
bad,Rotations are every 5 weeks. 12 hr shifts every other Sat. and Sun.. Don't look forward to benefits. Plenty of overtime. You will love the overtime if you looking for money. Don't expect help but there will be some who will.
bad,Constant 12 hour days on a concrete floor are terrible and the work is  not enjoyable or related to my chosen career in any way. Which makes the job very boring with poor management.
bad,"No review other than grateful to be employed during my time there. Repetitive, hard work that was mostly unappreciated."
bad,"RRD supplies contract employees for many other companies around the globe. Their benefits are expensive and generally pretty poor. I suppose that might be different for management personnel, but for the mainstream worker, most of the expense for medical benefits are borne by the employee, and raises are basically non-existent."
bad,"Every since the founder of the company passed it was not the same. He cared about his people, we would work to get the job done."
bad,This location is run poorly which stems from upper management. The culture is the bully mentality. The short change any body the can.
bad,"if your looking for a job straight out of high school this is the place. good starter job."
bad,This used to be a good place to work. Now it is not I would tell anybody I know not to go there. They will make you work lots of OT without ever a thank you. The turnover is getting crazy. They can not keep anybody or get anybody new to stay. Then when they get new worker they put them on there own and then the screw up work. It is sad.
bad,"Every day is different, You never know what you might get into. Sometimes you are making parts, sometimes repairing equipment. Sometimes in grease and ink. "
bad,This company is going down hill fast. The Lancaster plants are poorly managed and employees have low morale. Favoritism runs rampant and management treats their employees as if they were slaves. Terrible place to work.
bad,"I enjoy what I do but working at Donnelley isn't the career I want. Poor worklife and poor employee flexibility make for unhappy employees. The hardest part is there seems to be no vision for the future. Although employees try to talk to management, they do not seem to want to talk to us. Old, broken furniture, filthy carpets and a terrible dust problem make the workplace sterile."
bad,"Come in too work with alot of detail work for the day, learned something New EveryDay, Co workers were Helpful, the hardest part dealing with upset truck drivers, but i enjoyed the job because it was a challenge in the day went by so quick."
bad,"I learned how to work in a production line and assembly."
bad,Successfully managing my customers needs! The management is not supportive and the compensation is lowered with no real communication.
bad,"I worked with and for the company for nearly 4 years and it is apparent why people are so unhappy, jaded and disgruntled. The work itself is not difficult by any means. I personally worked in, or assisted, most departments in the building which includes:"
bad,"Since this company has very little supervision on the floor operators on the floor pretty well run what happens on the floor, "
bad,"I hated the job from day one.  I worked in a printing press, which uses dryers, and it was very hot, even in the winter time.  I came home every day with ink all over my clothes and arms, which is not easy to remove.  The pay and the benefits were pretty good, but I had to work myself half to death every day for it.  "
bad,"A very upsetting experience. The culture is just awful. Old boys club with unethical management and a ""virtual' HR department of little use to anyone. Some good co-workers, but everyone worked in an atmosphere of resentment, fear and bullying from upper management. If you don't fit in with the established culture, you are ostracized and worse."
bad,This job is the worse job I ever had. Worst managers and everyone there I can't understand them. The hardest part is understanding what they are saying to me. I learn not to ever worked at a warehouse that is far from where I live and never try to work for a warehouse that doesn't have a good management. The typical day was boring nothing new to learn.
bad,"Good pay, great co workers and supervisors. Two weeks vacation starting off. Don't expect raises or bonuses or even a thank you. You only get a promotion if you know someone in the upper office not based on your skill set. The hr department gives you a number to call with your questions or concerns that is automated and half way across the US and dont try to help get problems solved. They are a company that will do anything to save a dollar and don't care about employees. Not a steady flow of work expect to not be needed at least one or two shifts a week."
bad,"Due to mergers, and many other things, the company changed and was no longer a happy place to work, full of stress and constant fear of cuts."
bad,"A typical day is fast paced, putting out a lot of fires, maintaining the customer's expectations of the company through customer service."
bad,"This company looks great on paper and talks a good game, but seems to have the same old school values and methodologies as it did in the 60's and 70's. Do your research and read about the various restructuring phases, changes in philosophies and related law suits. RR Donnelley has the opportunity to be an industry leader but continuously falls short at the top. If they ever brought in a top CEO from a proven organization to really change the culture and core values; RR Donnelley would be a great place to build a career."
bad,"Management is often in remote locations, so there is not much feedback from management.  Every department is so separated you do not know what is going on in other areas."
bad,it would be a good places to work if they gave you more help and .better benefits. I also think they should do dinners and stuff to make it a more friendly place to work.
bad,Management is poor and too much overtime. No maintenance on equipment.Very stressful at times trying to get work accomplished with a lot of obstacles. Hard to maintain a balance social and family life with work.
bad,"It felt like a warehouse and the department that I worked in was too much drama, backstabbing and too much proofreading and not enough production done.  Hated it!"
bad,Attitude is what have you done for me lately. No respect or recognition. Special privileges for some not for others. Years of service don't matter. Management is very poor. Make uninformed decisions.
bad,always on the feet walking around for 5 to 8 miles a day heavy lifting required at picking material for shipping is the hardest part of the job not a very fun part
bad,"Well i believe this company could be a lot better, they made promises and didnt fulfill them. They also took my raise and i never even had a write up or anything there."
bad,Not a fun place to work. It was a job. It 's hard to become a full time employee once being a temp. They do not respect temps. I could run every machine and still did not get hired full time.
bad,"this is a company in continual change with a strong lack of standard operating procedures, which is definatly needed for an iso 9000 company.  Was a bad induvigual experience."
bad,Retyping quotes and making sure the person had done the math correctly.  All quotes were left till the end of the day then you had to scramble to make sure everything went out by COB. Sale would call in for you to make their arrangements and then change it 2 hours before they were to leave and get mad when they didn't get a window seat.  Look at their quotes from a phone and not understanding whey the page breaks do not match!
bad,"There is not a large enough focus on the client or employee. Management does not know enough about the industry and as a result it reflects in poor daily operations. This results in loss of clients, frequent turnaround, and ultimately, no job stability. Employees are not treated equally. There is a lot of favoritism that occurs. Management does not focus on work ethic and dedication, but rather who they have known and liked the longest. It is very difficult to advance in this field at this company when work goes unrecognized."
bad,"Health insurance is terrible and it increases every year, but we receive a company-wide 1% annual raise across the board.  It doesn't matter if you are a hard, dedicated employee, or a lazy, unproductive employee; you will receive a 1% raise regardless.  Every year I lose money with this company.  No room for advancement either.  Not a place for a young individual looking to move up in life.  Ideal for an older person set in their ways."
bad,The people that run the place all have ties with each other leaving newcomers to fend for themselves. Training is minimum and the quality of work is declining
bad,Poor training. Poor management. Faulty equipment. Not all employees are treated the same way.  All policies are applied depending on the employee and your performance is not valued or appreciated.
bad,"I would not plan on making a career here. At this time they are slow,  and the future doesn't look promising.  The supervisors are very nice but they do not care about your life outside of work.  So there's not a good balance between work and home."
bad,"Would not recommend to work there.  They don't care about people, they work you without paying you what you deserve.  They take advantage of people.  Find another employer"
bad,No work life balance. The expectations are to work 24/7 and bring your computer with you on vacation. Managers are not bad but everyone is so overworked. The clients are very disrespectful to employees.
bad,"It's a good company to work for if you are lucky enough."
bad,No feeling of job security. They are continually restructuring and downsizing. Depends on where you work  to how much balance you can achieve with your work life. You can be expected to work many hours of overtime
bad,"No raise in salary for over the past 4 years, benefits are always being reduced, asked to take on more tasks outside job description with no additional compensation. Downsizing every month, no job security."
bad,"Pay should be more. Management throw you under the bus. They lie to you. Not Bad for a short term job. NOT LONG TERM at all. "
bad,That's the only way I can describe them. Do not treat the staff well and in the six years that I worked there I was constantly at risk of redundancy.
bad,Terrible culture in a company that outsources any function possible to eliminate higher paid employees. Terrible pay.
bad,"i started at RR. Donnelly at 18 "
bad,Job is great. Management is very poor. Better training of management would improve employees morale. Better break system would also benefit employees.
bad,"RR Donnelley in Iowa City, IA is a good place to work if you do not mind the night shift. I would recommend to someone looking for a stable job but not for those who seek career opportunities."
bad,I appreciate the opportunity to work there and most people were nice. I like to move around and do several thing's at a time I enjoy working hard for the pay
bad,"I was hired initially for printing, then sent to logistics division - but that was quickly sold off to APX Logistics - they completely destroyed what RR Donnelley had started with."
bad,"Management has no concept of family life. If you don't volunteer for overtime hours, you will be forced more than you want (or are able to do). Supervisors have no integrity, and most of them aren't able to do the job of the ones whom they supervise. Human Resources does nothing for the employee."
bad,"If you take a sales job, remember that you'll be the lowest of the low at RRD.  Management and the manufacturing facilities work off of arrogance.  Unless you have a large title and have been there for many years, you are literally scum to upper management."
bad,"i would arrive at work then walk to my machine.(book binder) Check the rotation and see if i were to pack books or feed the paper into pockets. On average this summer its well over 105% in the plant. my co workers have mostly been there for a year or longer just basically stand around, while the new guys and gals work work work and work hard.Its a very hard place for an average person to work. thats why ive decided to continue my education and move into a field I LOVE. Working with snd helping any and all animals."
bad,"A typical day on this job would be, sign in, get to work.  Produce mass hourly production.  I learned team work at its highest form, management were not caring of employees, the best part of this job was signing out at the end of the day."
bad,"Extremely high turnover rate and bad management makes the translations department a depressing place to work. There is little incentive and not much opportunity for growth. There is little regard for work/life balance. Coworkers are generally very interesting and kind people, but bad management and a very stressful work environment with little to no appreciation makes it an unsociable and closed-off office setting."
bad,A typical BPO company that cater financial assets and liabilities of company.
bad,"I start my day doing yard checks then enter the information into an Excel Spreadsheet and send report to all appropriate people. Out Bound Carrier Report and enter all information into a spreadsheet. Recycle, Inbound and Outbound material, pick and store all material."
bad,People are great but the company benefits and salary are jot adequate for the position. Your asked to work many hours.
bad,"I didn't care to work for 4 straight hours without a break, though I didn't complain.  I learned a few things about the mail service.  Before RRDonnely took over,and it was Perry Printing, or Perry Judd, it was much easier to be hired on.  The people are generally nice, however, I felt like a minority being discriminated against.  The language barrier was somewhat challenging, however it didn't bother me.  Laughter is universal, and body language is multilingual."
bad,"very unorganized, who you know, not what you know. management is not what it needs to be. Need to work with peaple, not numbers"
bad,"I work through a temp service but really in the end you are treated the same, except for pay and benefits of course. A typical day could be busy or down right boring. I have been there for nearly 6 years but I could learn something new every day. Management used to be pretty laid back but after the hiring of a new HR manager things have gotten to be a little on edge. My coworkers are great, most of them anyways. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people."
bad,"This used to be a good place to work. The management is new at the Houston plant and they are making changes that don't allow production/csr staff to comply and get their job done. I have never worked anywhere that the management made my job so difficult to complete. I'm good at what I do and move work quickly, but my hands are tied so often that job become rushes while I wait for every approval to move forward. I am financially maxed out in my work category and have not been moved up to the next level. They say I'm great, but show me little respect in this area. There are definite issues, but they are not really doing anything about it. They are letting good employees leave and nobody is ""getting it"". I do love my sales people and most of the production staff - they are good people to work with."
bad,"A typical work day as a pricing analyst/biller is working behind a computer and making sure the numbers and information are correctly entered in the LINK system, however, most work days are very similar in the fact that there is one common goal, trying to get every job in for the month before closing. I work very closely with my manager, to make sure all of my jobs and invoices are completed and billed on a timely manner. I had great co-workers, we work hard and we help each other out when in need. The hardest part of the job was trying to get all the jobs in for the month and when one of my co-workers was too over-whelmed, I would try and do my best to help him/her out and try to get most of the jobs in for the month. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with my co-workers and helping each other out when needed."
bad,"I've worked here for over a year. Let me just say that I have never worked at a place as unorganized as this place. Employees are not being trained properly so mistakes are constantly, causing extra work to always be done. "
bad,Enjoyed the people I worked with. The managment staff in hebron is very knowledgable yet he have a very hard time with communication.
bad,"I am a former pressman at RRD Danbury, CT. plant that just closed. I have been in the printing industry for 30 years and agree that the industry is in decline, but I Disagree that RRD is ""sinking"". The company is very profitable and they are because thier business model is to buy companies for thier customer base, use up all the resources, and close up and move on."
bad,"begin day by checking turning on forklift and then make a round on the main floor of business, pickup skids of mailings to be sent out."
bad,•a typical day at work
bad,"It was a better company when it was Banta Book Group. The atmosphere was more family oriented and there were better benefits. Ever since, Donnelley took over it has become unbearable to work.Management seems to favor certain people over those with longer tenure. There a few people who you can rely on to make your work day go smoothly but that being said there are way more people who spend a significant amount time socializing instead of working. Pocketfeeding 85 or more pounds on certain jobs and piling down can really wear you out during overtime, I find it particularly interesting most people in the Press room do not have to lift as much weight as those in the Bindery. The Press room people either have a robot or a vauum lift to make their work easier. Working in the fall and winter is good because it is not as hot and when my crew get to work with lighter material."
bad,Ethics and Integrity is well below average. Management was in it for the money.
bad,Working for RR Donnelly was an ok experience. The management was ok. The company is a contractor.  Management held monthly Conference calls to check in with the employees on the teams and made sure everyone had the support they needed.
bad,I would not recommend working here. It is a common opinion in the office that it's a negative place to work. Many people are looking for jobs elsewhere.
bad,"This company seems to care only about filling seats with bodies.  Managers, in my experience, do not follow the strict compliance guidelines with regard to employee interaction."
bad,The company is well established and offers lifetime careers but you cannot expect to WOW them. They do not move at a fast pace. The department I worked in did not adhere to the job description I accepted and would change your functions daily.
bad,"Do the work, stay to yourself and you'll do fine. No advancement. People working there 30 years just waiting to retire. Local managers seem to try their best for you, but company wide rules just keep them locked down."
bad,The print and mail industry is in decline and the impacts are seen at RRD.  We are seeing eroding margins and the need to drive organic growth makes for a very challenging environment.
bad,RRD doesn't really know what type of mission to adopt and how to recruit the best talent. It is a manufacturing company. Business outsourcing company. Professional services company.
bad,"Was there for short time.  Did not enjoy my time there.  Not a lot of interaction between team.  Boss was nice, but he did not have a lot to say.  No annual review was given.  Pretty sad."
bad,"Dying Industry, poor morale, bully environment.  everyone was miserable working there.  employees complained all day.  rotating 30 minute breaks despite management threats.  leaving the press short handed at all times"
bad,Top Management is driving company into the ground. All decisions made at the top....and they only care about cost...miss numbers with bad M & A decisions....split will be final death blow.
bad,"Large corporate environment with various divisions and departments, to work with.  Intergrate and cooperate with different employees of varying skill sets with the same goal of providing quality output. Always meeting the needs of the client by providing unique and sound solutions to execute most efficiently."
bad,"come In get machine ready check water and ink look at the docket to see whats first and then get plates made and start printing the machine, some of the employees re great people."
bad,"Lack of communication"
bad,"Dont work here unless its your last choice. "
bad,"Poor Management, lack of communication. Disrespectful, favoritism with employees. Atmosphere was nice, only management was not. Leaders wasn't leading ever."
bad,"With so many locations the Management Team has difficulty working one on one with plant leaders."
bad,Workers 12 rotating shifts. Putting magazines together and driving a forklift to move product around. Pay was 12.50 an hour. Worked one week on first then one week on third
bad,"when i go to work, it doesn't mean i wanted to , it means i had to. So i still had to get up and go, even though i didn't want to. i honestly didn't like working at donnelleys."
bad,"Inconsistent communication and expectations. Departments do not work well with one another, competing for time and space making a smooth flowing process almost impossible."
bad,"I work 12 hours a day, supposed to be 3-4 days a week, but have to work at least 1-2 days of overtime per week to make ends meet. The management is horrible, and if just feels like they are running it into the ground and are eventually going to close the doors."
bad,everyone is always on everyone else business. Management only cares about the money and production made without even caring if someone is hurt or annoyed at something.
bad,They are a dying business squeezing profits off the back of their workers. Do not work here unless absolutely unable to find employment anywhere else.
bad,"RRD Chanhassen has a a very divisive culture.  The majority of the  people in the Client Services department only converse and socialize with others that they feel look and act like them.  The conversations are often bigoted, and discriminatory. These conversations take place in their cubicles, during work hours, in a loud tone for all to hear.  If called out on their behavior, there are few apologies from the perpetrators.  Management apologizes, but does nothing to change the culture."
bad,"Worked here for 20 years, from the time it was one of the better places in town to after most of the older folks had been transitioned out (laid off). Currently has poor management, frequent lay-offs, lots of shady characters hired on because that's all they can get. Very little opportunity to advance. Still have family working there, I never looked back."
bad,"You would do some stuff, but I did not work there enough to know the real deal. I am just not impressed with what I had seen when I was there........."
bad,"Unorganized, lack of planning, inexperienced management."
bad,RRD is a large company with declining revenue opportunities.  Management is struggling to keep the business relevant in the competitive marketplace.  Have had multiple rounds of restructuring to cut cost.
bad,Everyone to work with was really nice and helpful. All the managers were constantly walking around asking anybody if they need anything. The plant manager was very strict.
bad,work was very inconsistent. no communication from management. days were very long. hardest part of the job was the lack of knowledge I received on how to do my job
bad,"The moral is very low, benefits cost to much, they don't even match any amount for 401K....the atmosphere is dull. The people within are nice, but no one is happy. Short staffed."
bad,"Not give fulltime work, not have firstaid when hurt,and they have no any experiance to put people in work,and not hired people those work lile more then 2 years."
bad,Fast paced and disciplined environment. The most enjoyable part of the job is the family relationship between teammates. At this location I learned to work with and manage contract employees and perform technical trainings.
bad,"Didn't enjoy working here, was far from home and very tedious work. The pay was not great either.  I wasn't trained very well either.  Overall I didn't like the job."
bad,"I was the Supervisor over 2nd shift. I was in charge of 20 employees and enjoyed my job there, It was fulfilling and satisfying to get the product out to the consumer"
bad,"RRD is a typical manufacturing company with mostly great staff but unfortunately with too much politics running in the company."
bad,"This is the cheapest company I've ever worked for. They have almost NO benefits. They couldn't even provide a Christmas lunch, it was a potluck. They made a 16 year employee quit, rather than let her go and give her severance pay."
bad,"Company is not loyal to employees. People that had worked 40+ yrs. getting discharged to save a buck. No room for advancement, unless you ""know someone."""
bad,"Stodgy, stuffy, stuck in their ways company who refuses to adapt to the changing tides. Everyone is grumpy and frustrated because they have to bury their true personalities in lieu the corporate puppets they ask you to become."
bad,"Great people, basic health insurance benefits, many long-term employees work in this facility - can make learning hard."
bad,i would go in every morning from 9 am- 5:30 pm. my coworkers were helpful and nice people to be around.The hardest part of the job was picking up a pallet of magazines when they were dropped. The most enjoyable part of the job was driving a forklift that drove 12 miles per hour. my experience from that job made me realize that sometimes you don't get what you always want. i wanted a Monday though Friday job and i was forced to work weekends.
bad,"The pay is good, the people on the floor are great to work with. Management needs a definant overhaul. watch your pay closely they like to not pay you overtime."
bad,"This place runs 24 hours a day 365 days a year. I worked a 3 shift schedule. In the cylinder technician room your able to be bumped off your shift every 8 weeks being 1st shift is the favorable shift. Very hard to adjust to. Especially if you have family. Most of the time you will work 6-7 days a week. I worked 45 days straight with 3 days off. The work it's self isn't bad, the work schedule stinks, being 3rd shift is 12am-8am. Pay is decent, but the benefits are horrible. No 401k match, the pension plan has been gone since 2012, management looks at things as ""we've always done it this way"" and don't want to attempt to adjust to a new procedure. The equipment runs to fail, and is really old. Very disappointed I left a job to come to this place and it turned out to be way worse. This place could be doing very well, if they understood what lean manufacturing was."
bad,"Work 8hrs with maybe one ten minute break if you are lucky. You are encouraged to ""eat on the fly"", no scheduled breaks so you have to wait until someone comes to offer to take your spot for five minutes, you can't even use the restroom unless someone can take your place or your partner is willing to cover you. You are not allowed to go out to your car at all during your shift. The pay is the least I've seen in any manufacturing. Most places start at about $2 more. Extremely high turnover. Very physically demanding."
bad,Okie to work here as a Document Specialist. But salary hike is very worst. Many partialities. They need hard workers but they never understand their problems. but okayed to live and do job in this environment.
bad,good place to work but no to many hours.not to many good co-mail operators.this is big company and we have decent amount of red tape &politic.
bad,don't feel like this place will be here in a few years. low moral. don't feel management/supervisors care about us. only positive anymore is it pays the bills. don't look forward to going to work everyday.
bad,"Discontinued pension, discontinued 401(k) match, more and more work being handled by their Chennai, India and Chinese offices...what's to like?"
bad,"P&L responsibility for $31M retail marketing communications business including revenue and expense management in a matrix organization, integrated with client, strategic partners, sales, operations (local, domestic, offshore) and technology teams."
bad,"Always understaffed and if you do a good job they give you the work of the others that just show up. You don,t get anymore compensation than the ones that don,t do a good job either. They expect you to come in on the weekend and work but don,t give you any notice during the week that they will need coverage. Management for the most part just wants you to figure problems out on your own so if something goes wrong they can blame you and they don,t get in trouble."
bad,"A company slowly spinning out of control. Continues to take more and more away from employees. Poor training all around the manufacturing level. No one seems to be held accountable for their job responsibilities, be prepared to do several employees jobs on a daily basis with no support from management."
bad,"Large company in a shrinking market. Focuced on cost cutting."
bad,"A typical day at RR Donnelley was working in a fast pace environment on a daily basis with short breaks in between. I learned how to properly machine sweep and sort through the mail and match them up in the correct order. I didn't really like how the managers ran things at the Aurora, IL location because they were unorganized and rarely answered the phone during the day when ever i had questions or concerns. My coworkers were a big help and they were always willing to lend a helping hand when completing task i've never done before. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the fast pace and working under supervision because i am more of a independent worker and i like to work at my own pace. The most enjoyable part of the job was working on different projects every now and then when we would switch it up when things got too reptitive."
bad,Management cared more about what others thought then the work being done. They allowed workers to bully others and no follow through when private documents where taken.
bad,It's a print company. Not much print going on these days as we have resorted to the internet.
bad,I did a lot of heavy lifting and I didn't care to much for the job
bad,"(Glen Mills / Concordville PA Office) This is a terrible company to work full. Never have I been at a company thats so corporate 101 and follows each and every rule!"
bad,"You never knew from a day to day basis whether or not you were working overtime, and it was very difficult to contact supervisors or receive proper training. Everyone out there had very poor attitudes."
bad,Day to day we get a different experience in RRD
bad,"This printing company was a great place to be proud of. Very talented people working for the same goal. Success for our product, employees, and the company. Our goals remain the same, and alot of our talented employees are still here, but are slowly being driven out by our clueless management team. A nearly hostile management takeover took place here in recent years and since that time, an environment of favoritism, backstabbing, and all over uncertainty of job security has set hold. Its sad that the current management team can not see past thier office desks. The morale on the shop floor has never been worse. Office people are overworked and ready to walk. The supervisors have been whittled down to a few management favorite brownnosers that dont have the knowlege to help us. Management does not know who the valued employees are. They lay off who we need on our team and replace them with thier freinds even though they are useless. In the past few years we have lost dozens of seasoned printing professionals by either forced or voluntary departures. All replaced by lukewarm, wannabe yesmen for the metro management team. I am here looking for a new place of employment because my faith in the future of this management team is gone. After a couple decades in these walls I have to find a way out before the doors close in my face. Corporate RRD needs to replace this team of decision makers before its too late."
bad,No chance to grow with the company.
bad,"I have heard from people who were here since its was OfficeTiger and employees had a very good time, Good Bonus & Increment, Level 1 workers were safe. But after it was taken over by RR Donnelley everything was opposite. Yearly increments were in the range of Rs.300.00 to Rs.800.00 for a Grade 1 employee with a salary of Rs.12,000.00 and the Bonus ranges from Rs.5,000 - Rs.8,000.00."
bad,"Technology and database systems are outdated and limited to work in making workflow difficult and overly complicated. "
bad,Would not recommend to anyone if the person is not into management roles. A biased approach towards the employees and too many unnecessary restrictions. For the work pressure involved only a few teams gets know what incentives mean.
bad,"Do your job efficiently, work hard continue to learn and you will do well."
bad,A decent job if you seek abundance of overtime but does get slow two times out the year.  Coworkers usually dont have the best attitudes. Easy enough to pick up very quick.
bad,Pay is not consistent t with cost of living.  Raises are every year but insurance usually goes up more that raise.  Been there three years and bring home less now than when I started.
bad,"The people I worked with at RRD were fantastic. That does make a big difference. However RR Donnelley is consistently and will always consistently be extremely cheap...1% raises every year (not just me....but practically all on my team), no profit sharing and long 12+ hour days.  The working conditions were adequate, and they did have free coffee there... LOL. If you're looking to learn GMC Inspire and use this job as a stepping stone, work here then get your raise by quitting and working somewhere else. Otherwise good luck by staying here. You'll need it."
bad,Wasn't too bad hours were unpredictable and so were the temperary employeesas well as the temperatures not a bad job if More stable fit the bill when I needed it
bad,The work was simple but wasn’t able to get but 1 promotion in my 30 years of work. Manager only took word of operator so if operator didn’t like you then no promotion.
bad,"Hi all,"
bad,Management was horrible and the entire department was being outsourced to India. Coming to work everyday knowing that it could be your last day was a very ominous and stressful environment.
bad,"12 hour long days, Poor management. Old equipment in need of repair and update. The most enjoyable part of the job were the people. Poor wages and terrible raises."
bad,"I loved my job, had great customers and sales people, most people were great to work with and worked well together. Poor management, Production equipment was old and in poor condition, plant space is too small for the amount of work going through it,  dirty.   Cutbacks caused a lot of stress and frustration on employees."
bad,"The most enjoyable part of the job is the people.  The most difficult part is feeling upper management does not value it's employees.  They don't give decent raises (not even a cost of living raise), if any at all and they continue to put the majority of cost of benefits on employees.  Morale is very low and they don't seem to notice or care."
bad,Poor decision making from the Top.  Worried more about stock holders than doing the right thing.  Very short sighted company.  Look elsewhere you will no regret!
bad,"Stressful... don't know when it is your last day."
bad,"RRD acquired my large format printing company but never really seemed to listen to me when it came to sales strategy for the type of customer list that I had built. Consequently sales were not what they were expecting or hoping for."
bad,"Since the sell off and split in October 2016 the workload has increased, job benefits were poor. No bonus structure or reward for strong performers. A constant change in management. RRD strives to produce and worked hard for their customers but constantly pushed for saving without any solutions or tools. They did not invest in up to date technology. Many of the processes are manual and technology was very out dated in operations. They sell them selves as a communication company but use very antiquated software, customers would be shocked."
bad,"Difficult situation... had a lot of problems with equipment breakdowns... schedule was all over the map from week to week... break time was ludicrous, only 10 minutes for lunch..."
bad,"This is one of those jobs that if you do your job well and accurately, then you will be expected to carry those who don't and won't learn their jobs or are just lazy and expect the others to do their work for them so that they can float by. It is high paced at some times and is completely dead at others. No lunch breaks permitted. You get to have one 15-minute break during an eight-hour shift."
bad,the printing industry is dying. it would be foolish to accept a position here with any room for advancement. Not to mention they do not promote on merit. They promote strictly on tenure
bad,"A typical day at Iridio is always on a time schedule; for the whole day.  The photographer and team normally produces and edits one shot per hour.  The photographer is normally is the head of the creative team.  I learned that when management changes this structure, the result is not the best for the client and the workplace culture is changed for the worst.  The most enjoyable part of the job was producing work that set the client ahead of the competitors.  The hardest part of the job was not being able to chose your own team member to produce the best results for the client."
bad,I worked in a hybrid position. I was required to know  accounting and technology concepts. This was definitely an interesting position. Navigating a changing industry and balancing customer demands.
bad,This is a place for workaholic. With Saturdays and Sundays working 12 hours work during peak period will make your life more miserable. The only advantage is that office is well within the heart of the city.
bad,It is just a paycheck benefits are no good. No 401k match. Lots of favoritism goes on between management. Corporate keeps taking things away from the people
bad,Company was awesome to work for many years ago. It is still a good place to make money.   Our plant is closing so not much left to say.  Insurance has gotten way out of control verses pay increases.  My co-workers will be missed.
bad,starting for RR Donnelley was very hard. One of the hard job's I've ever worked. I was not showed how to do anything had to ask co-works if they speek English. I pick up on systems and know how thing work and operate very quickly. but I had to show myself. I trained a lot of co-workers on how to do things the right way because they was not properly trained. there was no good encouragements. management showed favoritism twored women first.
bad,The company overall is good but the supervisors and management are discriminating us and based us on our race not our hard work The work was do-able. God Bless
bad,Day to day activities are really fun & thought provoking. RRD as a company is really good except the PMO team lead who is a psycho & not good in people management. Entire IT SW Dev. team kows the fact.
bad,"Worked third shift and wanted to transfer to 1st or 2nd, but had to wait for an entire year before doing so. I learned a lot from being crossed trained. However, I was crossed trained because they could not find others to do the job at that time. Co-workers were great, because we all had something in common, our dis-like for the job. And it really wasn't the job, it was the people who was running the plant. Management was not that involved with helping, they were more concerned about their own positions and keeping them, then what was going on around them. The most enjoyable part was going home."
bad,"normal working place with no future...just work work work"
bad,"Time with RR Donnelley was filled with constant job security concerns, with no room for advancement especially since a recent company merger at a local level."
bad,"Typical day at work would be coming in, setting up the press or to continue running the press, and finish the job. I learned how to run many different presses. Co-workers are easy to talk to. Theres not really anything difficult about this job."
bad,"turnover is rampant, most employees have experience from 25+ years or less than 5 years, going in you will never make the salaries of the 25+ year group even though the younger generation is more efficient with use of technology and the older group are too set in their ways to change"
bad,"NO saftey air quality bad. "
bad,Learned a lot in my almost 9 years I have been here. Made lifelong friends as well.
bad,Worked there for almost 18 years. Worked my way up from material handler position to Inserter Operator/ Trimmer Technician. Work schedule is biggest draw back to job. Went from a 3 crew to a 4 crew  work schedule. 13 days on/ 1  day off. 12 hour work day which amounted to 2 days off a month. Allows for no personal life. Left there in 2008. Hope it has changed since then.
bad,"A typical day is I work 7-3:30 P.M. Monday through Friday. I get in and I go through the night receipts and enter everything in by hand. Then I sit at the computer waiting for emails to come through and quickly get them out of the way. My supervisor really does not know what I actually do because his office is on the other side of the plant. "
bad,12 hour days in no ac in the summer and no heat in the winter. Fast grueling work. Hard on the body and takes away from any life outside of work.
bad,Struggling company trying to stay relevent in today's market.
bad,Frustrating most days
bad,"- Contractors hired then layed off in bulk - at random intervals, depending on how poorly management has guestimated the current project needs."
bad,"Very underpaid for the work I perform. I am performing a large amount of work that my predecessor could not do yet I am being paid considerably less than what he was receiving.I have been months behind on my P.M.'s since my start date and can not keep up with my assigned work load, yet I am constantly receiving added job duties and responsibilities. Management prefers to apply band-aid fixes to equipment problems than correct the problems properly.I have been and am currently seeking employment elsewhere to alleviate the frustration I am going thru. I love the work, but need to work for someone who respects and appreciates my abilities and compensates me fairly for the work I perform."
bad,job is good but one week I'm working and then the next week I'm not
bad,It a Nice company to work in flexible time nice people who work there but poor management in Birmingham area unfair treatment plus less pay it was a nice experience
bad,"A child could do this job, the hardest part is staying awake. The management is poor and they harassed me constantly to apply for poorly paid jobs within the company so they could get a bonus off of me. The communication is poor and the job is for anyone that has no experience or cant get a decent job."
bad,"The worst experience I've had working. The leader of the project insulted me all the time, when I complained to the boss, I won her as  enemy. I contributed a lot professionally and I received very little in return."
bad,L'entreprise ou le travail en général est calme et l'ambiance avec les équipes de travail mais la direction c'est pas des bonnes personnes qui occupent leur poste c'est pour ça sont pas professionnel
bad,"Slow paced work environment coupled with a 12 hour shift results in a fatigue/possible error prone environment, especially in night shift."
bad,"It's great to work with so many talented and easy to get along with people, but there's little to no opportunity for growth/advancement and the situation on the ground in the office is exactly what you'd expect when looking at a graph of RRD's stock prices over the last 2-10 years."
bad,"The work place was clean. But they operate 24 hour a day 7 days a week.  Which means we work rotating shifts, 2 weeks on 3rd,  2 weeks on 2nd and 2 weeks on 1st. It hard to balance work and home life"
bad,"I don’t really have anything detrimental to say about the company, it just wasn’t for me. It didn’t pay enough by far & there was nowhere for you to advance to. The office was setup like it was ready to be dismantled at any point. Got a 2 great friends out of working there so it wasn’t a complete loss."
bad,Nothing changes and nothing improves because printing is a dying industry and the company has a top down corporate structure that does not lend itself well to change and innovation.
bad,"The day of work at R.R Donnelly is starting at 6 am or 3 pm with the choice of working Monday-Wednsday or Thursday-Saturday.First, you would clock in and have your supervisor place a station where you would be there until you finished with all the mail that runs through. Your breaks would consist of 1(30 min.) lunch and 2(15 min) breaks, and then back to your station sorting mail for the rest of your 12 hour shift."
bad,Decent place to work for younger people. Fast paced environment and easy. Overtime is forced and also available weekdays and weekends due to understaff
bad,Hardest part is too many black-out days where pto is restriced. Management is good. Learned advanced skills for Word and Excel. Set hours allow me to plan my day.
bad,Tough time to be in printing. Focus changed to more digital & social media. When someone left they were not replaced. Long hours and heavy workload. All projects were time sensitive.
bad,Overworked underpaid don’t appreciate there staffs hard work stopped giving out bonuses out warehouse staff never appreciated & always over worked staff always moaning about certain management
bad,"a good leaning to this company, how to make clients calls, working Multiple roles performed with the challenging tasks."
bad,"Falta de departamento de Ingenieria."
bad,"No advancement or certain future with this company, low wages must work shift swings every 6 weeks no guarantee of moving to next scheduled shift. Atmosphere has very low morale."
bad,"no benefits, RRD has taken all incentive to work for them, the leadership is more concerned about boosting stock shares and filling their own pockets than helping the employees feel like they are part of something special. Its a job nothing more."
bad,I felt like a slave and did not enjoy working with the other employees. They over work you and do not pay enough at all. not very friendly and expects you to be like a machine and not speak to others.
bad,"one thing i cannot complain about is the pay. but if you are trying to get a job a donnelley to start a career and/or get promoted quickly, id have you know that the following things dont mean a  thing to anyone with any kind of authority: education, versatility, willingness to learn, work ethic, and reliability. from the first day of your new hire orientation, donnelley will try to make you think that they are one of the most anti union companies there is, and that they treat their employees with enough respect for their not to be a demand for a union to begin with. what they wont tell you is when it comes to how the company conducts their promotions, they are no different from a union company, meaning that the company has race/minority status and seniority based promotions. the work characteristics of employees that should matter simply dont mean anything."
bad,"12 hour shifts (2 days/2 nights alternate) are very hard to get a decent work/life balance as a consequence."
bad,"Worked third shift with a few employee's. I was the supervisor. Also produced jobs for print. Would come into work, review incoming work and decide what order jobs had to be done. Assigned jobs to employee's by experience. Assisted other divisions on how to prepare purchase order for print, etc. Again client does not come first. If it's late it's late. No feedback, good or bad."
bad,A typical day at RR Donnelley is usually slow starting off. I begin by checking all the mail sorting machines to see what type of mail they are running and if they need tickets. Once enough mail has been sorting the Supervisor then analyses the mail and creates groups to sort. I then print and pass out tickets for those groups. For the rest of the shift i make sure every bin of mail has tickets. I have learned how to operate a mail sorting system. The RR Donnelley management isn't the best but they get the job done. The co-workers are a bit slow and don't take orders very well. The hardest part of the job would be keeping up with all the mail on the sorting machines. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to learn something everyday.
bad,"Good Management"
bad,"Fun at work session is good"
bad,i will do my level best
bad,Productivity only there are no any free time in the office. some time we havent 1hour brake all the day.
bad,Don't expect a lot from a career at RRD.  The business was suffering during my time at RR Donnelley.  The pressure of declining revenue impacted benefits and pay raises negatively.
bad,The job is simply as follows: You sort parcels of mail and scan them onto their appropriate countries; You must make the quota with your team at your station.
bad,Management  is  good does  good benefit to employees but shift timings are more and  salary perks are low ;shift timings should be reduced to 8 hrs per day
bad,"Good place to work"
bad,"normally always productive."
bad,not willing to help you succeed. I learned a lot but my supervisor was more worried about my personal life than work life. if you don't pick up quickly they will berate you before they try to help you be successful. the good pay is the ONLY thing I miss.
bad,"Great people to work with. However, no defined career progression, no benefits, increased amount of work moving offshore, staff ideals not valued. Remaining staff becoming increasingly disenchanted and demotivated."
bad,"A lot of the ""State of the Art""  equipment is cobbled together, sometimes unable to run the jobs we take. The hours are ridiculous, though plenty of overtime for those who want it (and those who do not.)"
bad,You do have the possibility to choose your “normal” working hours (within reason) but you’re pretty much expected to work overtime no matter what. The work is task based so if you don’t get your tasks done within your normal 8 hours you’ll have to leave work unfinished or work overtime.
bad,"The pay for the job is better than average.  They typically hire people with some experience and don't do much training."
bad,A typical day working for R.R.Donnelley was for the most part fun to work for depending how busy it was. It could be stressful if it was busy and real laid back when you were not busy.
bad,"I worked at RRD for 2 years and gained a lot of responsibility over those years, went from not managing a team to managing a team of 8 people. I would work a lot of overtime and on top of managing the team would also manage the most complex projects that would come in. I asked for a raise on a weekly basis and never got one over an 8 month period. I decided to move on to a company where when change happens they can catch up and make sure their employees are receiving the incentives to continue to put in 50+ hour weeks."
bad,"It can be frustrating sometimes stress does get into you, but I learned a lot there, the harderst part on it is every now and then theres a new workflow coming new operating procedure needs to take place, but from it we learned how to be flexible and to adapt in this fast paced environment."
bad,"Company is technologically challenged. Way behind in current WMS systems, utilizing out dated programs that don't define clear metrics for associates to meet. High seasonal turnover, lacking competitive pay for skill positions. Friendly employees and leadership team."
bad,"Great salary benefits, however immediate manager (senior executive) was uneducated about basic management and leadership techniques.  Company offered no meaningful opportunity for professional development."
bad,"Seasonal Position that require 7 days a week 10-12 hours days. Was a Material Handler, stack product onto pallet and deliver it to shipping department."
bad,The company culture is not one that appreciates employees. They need to enter the 21st Century. Benefits get worse every year.
bad,"Working on an assembly line magazines would come down a line and we would have to palletize them, Wrap, And send out. The work was non stop and there was no weight limit to what was coming next down the line. Some were very heavy and some didn't weight to almost nothing."
bad,"not much to say.  lots of policies, and then policies to policy the policies.  rules galore.  never sure which they will enforce.  money is good.  they do what they can to cut your overtime out. if your done learning or advancing and just want to settle into a routine....this is the place for you."
bad,"The company itself is ok, but I am employed through a temporary agency thats contracted by RR Donnelly. Unfortunately the hours are way too up and down but as far as the job goes it's not a bad place to work."
bad,Very stressful environment with poor management and even worse pay raises.  The company culture went rapidly down hill over the years. The worst people given advancements while others carried the work load.
bad,"A vary relaxed place to work. Yet, there is no opportunity for advancement at this location. It's basically a dead end job. If you're complacent with a job with no future then this is for you."
bad,"people are great to work with. great when  it comes to working a day shift."
bad,Not a good place to work if you want to be challenged or try to advance in your career. Management acts unprofessionally at times and entices you to partake in procedures that are poor use of time. I would not recommend working here.
bad,"There was a lot of comradeship between staff members."
bad,"It is a factory environment with lots of mandatory overtime.  The management wells good, but not highly motivated.   I enjoyed the crew I worked with, because everyone pitched in and got things done."
bad,"When I first got the job it was very busy each day, lots of manual work that needed to be done by the end of each day. The work was fast paced and the day went quickly. There was even a time where I was getting Overtime nearly every night of the week which was awesome. As time went on though some of the software we used became more automated which cut down on all that manual work. There was a merger of two facilities that gave us far too many people and layoffs followed. I managed to stick it out for as long as possible until I ended up being the one without a job. My direct manager was probably the best person I could ever work for, through thick and thin he was great to me and the other employees. I give him the 5 stars not necessarily the other managers in the building. The hardest part of the job was learning some of the processes needed to perform jobs. The enjoyable parts were some of the co-workers I got to know. What I learned was that there was no room for advancement here, you got your annual 1% raise which was given to everyone regardless of their work ethic. I also learned that the more automation you implement into your work day the less of a need you will become because now a computer will do you job for you. By the end the typical day was very mind numbing and boring."
bad,"You have to stand all day and walk a lot. Some people find it as hard work, you get a 15 min paid beak and a 30 min lunch not-paid. Co-workers and management are really nice. But it's temp work so it very unsteady you never know if the day you walk in may be your last day of work. It's not that they fire people but if there is no work they send you home and you have not idea when more work will come in."
bad,RR Donnelly (Fulfillment Specialists) is a warehouse job in which demands hard work with little recognition.
bad,"Average place to work occasionally slow "
bad,I was told I would be able to move from night shift to day shift within 1 year 2 at the most after 2 years when a day shift spot opened up I inquired about going to days and was told I have no chance that there’s a waiting list of ten people ahead of me.
bad,"I enjoyed most of my coworkers, and felt that I was needed."
bad,The company overall is a very respectable organization because of their longevity in their field. But their rating is specifically based off the location on which you're offering service. I would not recommend them as a great place to gain employment if the objective is to work in an enjoyable environment. Co-workers and management are cut throat and will take credit for your delivered skills.
bad,"Annual raises are 1% annually."
bad,Still quite new to the job so cant say much but the staff is friendly. Will be honest about a lot of polish people working there which makes it hard to understand them if you dont speak polish.
bad,"laid back for the most part, until your operater decides that they are going to continue running knowing the book is bad. really bad when the superviser tells them its ok, run it. then when the account holder rejects the book everyone wants to blame the little guy and not take accountability for what they did"
bad,Simply put you'll make a bunch of money work a load of over time and spent zero time with your friends family and loved ones. You start as a material handler and if you make it with a poor training philosophy you've earned a job where you'll lift reams of paper over and over for twelve hours a day for six weeks then nights
bad,"you have to work a lot of hours and do not get many off days but the pay is good and you can make a lot of money, the managers are very nice and helpful"
bad,My position was sent to India. It was good to work for at first but new management was hired and things changed. Other departments were sending their work to India as well.
bad,"My work is done in computer programs. Fellow employees are good people. Toughest part is that the work load is very inconsistent, there are times of the year that you feel like you will never get caught up with work and then you hit times when there is nothing to do."
bad,"Awesome job shadowing skills. Very skilled at showing and letting  you preform hands on. Also, I like to learn there way so I know I can continue the job well."
bad,It's okay pay and 12 hour mandatory shifts. People who have worked there 10+ years make a tiny bit more than new employees. Benefits are similar to comparable positions.
bad,Working at Donnelley's was a new experience for me. I believe working 2nd shift is more suitable for younger people without children. As a single mother of 2 teenage girls it was difficult to work the long hours and shift.
bad,"I choose not to Rate the company who has kept my family going for 3 generations.   I Love what RR Donnelley stood for once upon a time.   It has taught me to have strong work ethics, to be loyal and dedicated to my job and the requirements of it.   I have learned to conform to change in systems and work environment.  To be open minded yet stand firm in what is necessary to keep cost low and business that I am involved with profitable. "
bad,Slow repetitive work. Too many temps without experience used to man machines. Operators suffer from lack of skilled employees.
bad,A typical day at work is long but usually interesting. I learned how to take initiative and be a leader to my coworkers. The hardest part of the job is working a 12 hour rotating shift. The most enjoyable part of the job is the coworkers and freedom to work with minimal supervision.
bad,This company is okay to work for. It would be even better if your management would treat you like employees instead of an employee number and thank you for a job a well done when needed.
bad,RR Donnelly was a very interesting place because each day brought on new and challenging things.  Because there were so many deadlines to meet it made the atmosphere serious all the time.
bad,"Basic office procedures plus data entry, order processing, acquiring estimates, pricing."
bad,"Its a factory if you need money it will do. If you don't try to work somewhere else. Long hours, heavy work, no thank yous. You will not be appreciated."
bad,"The Pay sucks., the people dont work together., there is no form of communication., its every man for theirself., no breaks., i just dont feel welcome there"
bad,it was a decent job. made good money but the people there are nosey. favoritism is bad there. it was a sweat house and alot of moving and constant work but it was good pay.
bad,"In order to make a substantial amount of money, you have to sign up for overtime and work everyday you have off in order to make a decent paycheck.   The labor is hard, and very rigorous. Twelve hour shifts and working a rotating graveyard, and daylight schedule every two weeks."
bad,I loved working for this company before it was taken over by RR Donnelley & Sons. They didn't seem to carry over the feel of employee satisfaction that Comunicolor had.
bad,"the job was ok steady work for those that actually worked others stood around and made more money if not the same, workers werent the kinds of people you want to be friends with due to back stabbing and rumors"
bad,"La situación de la empresa es de público conocimiento."
bad,"No scope in promotion."
bad,I worked the 3rd shift. It was not the best situation for me. The company is okay.
bad,company continues to consolidate locations and close locations
bad,"Work hard"
bad,"RRD is not a bad company but as print continues to lose its place in communications the largest print organization in the world is struggling to change its identity. They have a lot of overhead, plants have been closing and pricing in the industry is very sensitive. Management has been investing in new technologies but RRD is not known for being nimble and that is a problem. In July 2016 the stock was selling at $32 and now it’s below $9 per share."
bad,I Enjoyed my journey here at RR Donnelly I learned a lot of things I never knew before but I’m ready to move on and see what else I can do. RR Donnelly does under pay there forklift operators maybe for the reason being where we’re located but I would like a little more recognition for my work performance. Management doesn’t do there job either eventually all the good co workers left and now it’s headed towards the ground.
bad,"Photo copying of important documents for the Sec. Quality-control proofing of production materials. Shiping and receiving. Maintain production log notes from shift-to shift while also"
good,not a happy place to work very unorganized supervisors not very aware of what is going on with employees actions was hard to voice your opinion on things that you felt could help with production would not want to work at this location again
good,"work was okay, management could be a little better. overall work environment was good, and work ethic was good as well. CO-workers were good and enjoyed working at times. I learned many things such as driving a forklift and pallet jack which is going to help in the near future."
good,"A typical day,"
good,"typical day at work consists of working on help desk tickets assigned to you, telephony, light network administration, and imaging of machines."
good,We had to break mail and put it in a boxes and strap it and but it on pallets and take to floor and I had to help the PA and check Q's and it was fun and everything
good,"Started job with no experience  working in a warehouse and finished working with RR Donnelley with alot of knowledge TEAM WORK MAKES THE DREAM WORK ,ONE TEAM ONE DREAM that was my motto to get me thru the day"
good,"It was a wonderful place to work until benefits and hours decreased, then moral completely went out the window. You WILL NOT feel valued at this company. If you work harder, you just receive more work to do with no added pay. I worked there for almost 8 years and was let go soon after a minor work injury while pulling a pallet (mind you I was also pregnant at the time)- that I repeatedly told them was too heavy for me but was forced to do it anyways. I am not leaving this a disgruntled ex-employee, I loved my job and would have probably stayed another 8 years. However, what I am telling you is to not make the mistake of thinking you're valued by any means, because you're not at RR Donnelly."
good,Very stressful. Hardest part of job was handling too many responsibilities. The workplace culture is difficult to deal with. Too many cliques where only friends of management could advance.
good,"a typical day at work >> they talk the talk ,,, then stab you -"
good,"Gestion de dossier, achat d'impression, relation client, gestion litiges, bon de commande, facturation, suivi de commandes."
good,New environment for me.  Personnel were okay.  Had to learn many different apps.  Training was inadequate.  The most comfortable part were my immediate coworkers.
good,"This used to be a great place to work, I loved my job for many years. They have slowly taken everything away and many people that have been there for 20+ years have left. We are all wondering how long they will be in business, very poor management skills."
good,"Yup, there once was a ping pong table, then there wasn't. Once there were Christmas Parties, then there weren't.  Once there were performance reviews, then not."
good,"Working for this company is stressful. You are indeed over worked and under paid. Management is not professional and shows favoritism. I have learned that it doesn't matter how hard you work to supervisors or management but if they like you will determine things for you. Raises and benefits are not good at all. No bonuses, so don't look for one. the most enjoyable part of the job is when its time to go home."
good,Working at luciano's used to be fun but was always a place where I knew I was not going to be for the rest of my life. the hours are long and it was ok for me for the experienced but that is about it.
good,It is a Good place to work if you are single or have no young childen. They like to work you 12 hours a day and up to 6 days a week. I learned how magazine are made. The best part of working there was the co-workers. The hardest part of this job was work alot of hours with a five year old son and going to school.
good,The hardest part of the job was working 12 hour shifts with little time to sleep being it was an hour to one in a half to get to and from
good,"As a project manager the environment was extremely fast paced and stressful, but also enjoyable. I would recommend the company to anyone. Pay was reasonable and the benefits were good. Time off benefits were reasonable. I was also able to work from home as needed. The group in Antioch worked together as a team and achieved success in several areas, safety being the top area of success. The company had a reasonable training environment and help set employees up to achieve their goals."
good,"I loved my job printing there the managers are not good there, they treat you unfairly. I have worked as many as 70 days in a row. The higher up management are all related to one another. That is not a good way to run a company."
good,"Hourly pay is decent but the raises never come, and they take away additional benefits every year. Cost of living raises yearly but they are only .07 of a percent."
good,"Stressful environment I work in 3 different departments no raise been here 19 years only make 36,000 a year benefits no good. Hardest part is when you do 3 different department of work they don'y appreciate an employee. Enjoyable part is when I am on vacation & not working."
good,"Do not wish to comment at this time.  It's a job if you really need one. Typical job, you punch in do your job and punch out.  eight hour shifts, can be trying at times"
good,Ok place to work. They offer insurance although it's on the expensive side. You get paid weekly but the pay isnt adequate enough for the job you do. I work 12 hours with only two 5 mins. and one 15 min. break.
good,"Expected to work long hours, and do not receive many benefits.  No 401K match, and annual raises do not keep up with the cost of living.  Good initial pay rate."
good,"Depending on where you work will greatly determine how good of an experience you do or don't have. Many locations are run completely different than others, so choose wisely."
good,"filling and skid packing mail or filling tray.   Stressful at times,  fast paced,   hardest part is company is losing to many people,  lack of home time with family.   work place enviroment has cheanged for the worse.   Too many people who dont care to preform there job duties."
good,"A typical workday consists of multiple deadlines that need to be accomplished daily. I learned the benefits as well as some of the pitfalls of the logistics industry - including calculated risks and unseen pitfalls. The workplace culture was one of inclusion."
good,This was a temporary job the reason I left was because I would show up to work only to be turned around due to them not having any work available. Which caused me to leave.
good,"In all honesty, the time I was working there was great because of the people, but the hours were insane. "
good,a lot of work vary busy large amount of lifting and moving all day on your feet and loads of overtime and hours at work 12 day work weeks .
good,"This was an account-temp job doing payroll. I had control of payroll and benefits, some AP and AR. Company was closing it's Wisconsin office and manufacturing facility."
good,working every other weekend started getting old no body wants to work together and you get punished if you punch in 1 second late. they promote from with in but the ones that is been in the position doing the job but promote the one that doesn't have a clue on what is really going on
good,"A typical day is fast paced with multiple people continuously asking how soon the project you just started on will be done. The environment reflects the type of leadership, unfriendly. There is very little conversation between employees even during breaks, which are very short and few. Management seems to have a disregard for employees and doesn't seem to care that they have an extremely high turn over rate."
good,"One day last May 2015 I made the mistake of telling the supervisor I was planning on giving a 2 week notice and for him to please make time to bring someone over for training. This is our busy season and I am dedicated to my job and did not want to put the company in any delays on shipments. I also stressed for him to please not say anything to anyone because the job I was interviewed for has a very extensive hiring time frame and I could be still working at RRD for the next couple of months and, I didn't want to be harassed by co-workers coming over asking, who, what, when, where and, why. 20 minutes later I had a supervisor do exactly that. 2 weeks later I had HR tell me I no longer have a work email because I took a job elsewhere. 3 days after that I began receiving phone calls from co-workers asking those harassing questions. It's been over a month now and everyone keeps asking. Management is so untrustworthy and I'm counting the days when everything comes back from the Federal Government job in NOVA. So, I keep checking my Candidate Dashboard."
good,"12 hour shifts one break only lunch, if you can do this than you can work there. Pay is low. co workers are ok but everyone looks exhausted. There is no hard part of the job repetitive sometimes boring."
good,Dead in job with no room for advancement. They do not give out a raise at all. So what you start at is what you are stuck at.
good,Good place to make fast money. Bad management. Machines broke a lot. Employees were rude.
good,"Donnelley seemed like a great place to work until I began noticing unprofessional flaws. Supervisors change the schedule without notice to workers causing employees to have dnrs- did not report/no call no show or tardies then your pointed. An average day consists of fairly easy work packing books onto skids but some of the machinery is outdated constantly breaking or having paper jams. Stress is inevitable you always have to be on your toes. the management  is point blank for the company not the employee, as an example our latest snow storm a third of the employees couldnt make it into work and got pointed even with a travel advisory in affect. The most enjoyable part of my job is the concentration level I have to maintain."
good,"13 to 14 hour days with very little time off, Insurance is expensive and the Bonus plan is a joke."
good,The company started a new program/department without really being fully ready for the tasks it would complete. There were several changes in management and standards which led to confusion and a drop in production and quality products each time a management change was made. The best/most enjoyable part of the job was probably my coworkers. Everyone (except management) was so easy and laid back to deal with and we all worked together well. The hardest part was keeping up with the changes in procedures that seemed to be happening daily. There was no consistent training so not everyone was doing it the same way and it caused a lot of havoc.
good,"They hired me off the internet, moved me to greenfield ohio, I had two paychecks of 80 hrs for two weeks then I never got over 60 hours for 2 weeks after that...Feel like I got the ole bait n switch! oh well"
good,The workplace lacked culture but provided employees with opportunities to succeed. Many employees had spent a long amount of time there which demonstrates job security.
good,Started off great to work there. But they do play favorites there and were not tough on the ones that would not work and left more work for the other employees
good,"stressful work environment. people are rude and disrespectful. no matter what you do its  always wrong. always behind with current work schedule. Over worked and under paid,"
good,Ótimo para se aprender a trabalhar e desenvolver dsa
good,Poor management and direction. No advancement. Poor wages. No raises.  No paid sick leave. Revolving door. Uses temps for labor. Did have great hours.
good,Worked there for 12 years. First 2 were with agency. Printed and mailed paper bills for phone companies. Got made redundant when Gateshead plant closed down. Not enough work as more people get their bills online these days.
good,The hard workers are expected to work harder and the lazy workers are promoted or allowed to work less. The hardest part of the job is accepting the poor management mentality. I enjoyed several of the other employees.
good,"knowledgeable and very polite staff, lots of infrastructure issues, scattered, obsolete and very hard to maintain code-base, no work/life balance, lacking proper architecture"
good,"It is not great it isn't awful."
good,The hardest part of the job was that there were not enough hours in the day to complete everything that was needed. The position should have had 2 Project managers for 23 Account Managers.
good,"While the environment was clean, safe, and well organized, the assembly staff was poorly managed from an HR perspective. We were never treated as people but as our respective ID number and given minimal incentive to continue work."
good,"very long hours for a jogger helping the first and secound pressmen with there work plus your work,swig shifts not really worth losing family time.but good luck"
good,"I worked in this company for almost 4 years. Though the work environment is not that professional, but people are very cooperative and helping. Even management addresses the issues very quickly."
good,The orders are sometimes undone and customers complain. Co workers partially worked and joked around. Break time was 15 minutes. Other than that it was okay.
good,Customer Service at R.R. Donnelley is an exhausting and poorly rewarded position. Expectations increased consistently with little in the way of promotion or rewards.
good,"Physically demanding job, on your feet all day. Very friendly coworkers. Job becomes easier as you get used to it. Even on slow days there are lots of things to do to keep busy."
good,A fresher must start his or her career at this place. A bachelor or bachelorette would for sure enjoy their tenure. A good platform for freshers' growth.
good,"I like to change company because RR donnelley not give fulltime work and also not have good behavour to worker,and they are not helpfull people like manager.etc"
good,"The management was very poor.  The company had NO respect for employees."
good,"I worked for RR Donnelley for 29.4 years.  "
good,Employees expressed the safety concern during operating equipment to manager but company normally disregarded their opinion. I felt sorry for all employees who ever worked in production line under heat temperature at 110 F
good,Most day could only work 4-6 hours instead of 7.5 hours a day. When it is busy the day doe go fast. Management are good people. The prople are great to work with.
good,work is very slow hard to live but decent paying job. the work comes and goes not a good place to build for yearr. good paycheck but who knows how long that last
good,"Trabajo  rutinario"
good,Management doesn't seem to be interested in the daily operations of the press. They are hiring people with a could care less attitude. Long term employees are generally very good.
good,be at work on time some days did no get a break made the same money I did 5yrs ago no advancement if and when you needed help you were lucky to get it no future
good,"Uma empresa que, não se presa muito aos funcionários mais novos ou por contrato"
good,The vast majority of people are easy to work with  but there is a growing lack of accountability which is allowing some to not meet there daily responsibilities.
good,Hard work with no support from the managemant site. Super co-workers and really interessting job. Long working hours. Bonuses schema not very clear.
good,"Assist Management and employees, contractors, and visitors."
good,"Aprendi ajudar e a ensinar colegas de trabalho,tenho que cuidar da partes interna da máquina evitando deixa-la parada e auxiliando outras funcionárias.Aprendo a trabalhar em equipe pois são muitas pessoas que pensam diferentes e as vezes dificultam a entrar em acordo.Meus colegas de trabalho são na maioria homens e que me respeitam,me escutam,e me ajudam no que eu precisar,são pessoas muitos boas de convivência.A parte mais difícil do meu trabalho é trabalhar finais de semana e a parte mais agradável é saber que eu poço contar com pessoas maravilhosas e profissionais."
good,"Co workers were awesome"
good,"The people i worked with were very easy to get along with and very helpful. "
good,"Set, operate side sew machine perform maintenance on all equipment. Perform quality checks on soft and hard cover books as well as machinery."
good,Rendered research and analytics services for US/European clients
good,R.R Donnelley was a great place to work untill the internet started taking over the written word. since everything has started to go electronic things have changed pretty drastically.
good,My day begins by getting a pass down of what has gone on during the shift before me. Finish up what is left from previous shift and do preventative maintenance. Let management know of needed down time to fix large problems and they let me know when the down time is to start. Good relationship with other maintenance workers and with the other employees in the production area all of us are willing to work together. The hardest part is when pressed for time to get a major job done in a limited amount of time with limited resources. I enjoy my job most of the time except when we are shut down because of lack if work.
good,"Go in see what  happen on the shift before. Go around the line and check the equipment. check the crew knows there assigned job .check books for quality. when something goes wrong that you never had to fix, just figuring out how to get it fixed write away. Is working with co-workers as a team."
good,This job was long ago but i was young and it was a job at the time. I worked hard at keeping the store clean. I was fast at register.
good,Was hired on and given extremely poor training on the daily functions I was to carry out. Employees that are there now are jaded and working the system for freebies and not training new hires properly. Was hired through a  L10 months even though I had an accident report...staffing firm they use churns and burns new employees in order to reach goals they set. Bad experience although some of my co-workers were very nice people.
good,"Plating, some mac work"
good,"I would not recommend this job to anyone, Because they are an unsafe place to work for. Also they show alot of discrimination to the new people. If I would have had the chance to leave sooner I would have."
good,"I worked mid-nights therefore work would begin at 12 am. I would do a safety inspection on my forklift fill out paper work and have a safety meeting."
good,Good place to work.  Had to have major back surgery so lost my job do to it.
good,on a normal day any email requests sent after 2pm from the previous day would be dealt with as soon as i start then there will be a range of different type requests to be looked at during specific time allocations and have to be completed. i learnt that i can complete all the work given to me and finish it within the time frame set and work at a evenly pace to make sure it was done correctly and if there was anything i was stuck on i can ask certain work colleagues as to what i should do if i was in doubt. the hardest part of the job was to look at deceased accounts as per reasons i found it difficult to deal with.
good,"financiele werkzaamheden waren veel voor een persoon. Je bent manusje van alles. PZ, facility en boekhouding doe je alles zelf."
good,The work is ok depending on the department. The co-workers are alright. The hardest part of the job is working in the heat.
good,"When I first started with this company, it appeared to be a pretty decent place to work. But they are always taking things away from us, and are not looking out for the employees any more."
good,"A day at work is very fast paced, demanding, dangerous and need to be well-focused. I have learned how to drive different machinery. I have learned to deal with many people. I have learned many new things and learned to deal with pressure. Management has no positives. Management is one reason I am interested in leaving. Co-workers, there are good and bad. I go to work and do my job, I am not there to make best buddies. Hardest part of the job is working in the heat and exhaust from the trucks. Also dealing with Management. Most enjoyable part is leaving at the end of the day. Honestly it would be working with certain coworkers."
good,timekeeping for all shifts and all departments on a daily basis
good,"working at RR Donnelly was great.Love the management and the environment. A typical day at RR Donnelly I would be working a 12hours only con, our shift never had a consistent starts time"
good,"n/a Not much to say, you can experience the facility to your own likings. I don't have much to say other than if you feel like work labor is for you then by all means go for it."
good,"After working there for 7 years, I was able to gain experience on both sides of the Warehouse & Logistics spectrum. Unfortunately, the raises were not based off of performances, but based off of overall work merits (meaning 1% yearly). They always wanted to push more work on to you, but if you asked for a raise of any sort, they would say that they are on a ""Hiring Freeze"" and is unable to provide any raises of any sort. The overall team was great! Every member of the team helped one another, and was able to provide advise and assistance on multiple accounts due to everyone being cross trained on the multiple lanes/accounts RRD had. The other luxury they offered was working from home in the case of any family emergencies and/or weather issues causing employees to be unable to make it in to work. I believe that was my favorite thing about working there, besides my team members."
good,"Por se tratar de uma empresa multinacional, com operação em diversos países, faturamento superior a 15 bi de dólares, tinha a ideia de que minha passagem seria diferente e as oportunidades existiriam."
good,empresa abriu falencia deixando os funcionario na mao
good,"typical factory job, high turn over rate. forced overtime, either feast or famine when it comes to hours. i havent worked there in almost six years so things have probably changed"
good,From around Thanksgiving through about the first couple of weeks in January you worked 12 hours a day 7 days a week.  Sometimes you had to work on Christmas day.
good,working the swing shift and not knowing when u were off or was made to work overtime sucked was placed in different jobs all the time and moved around alot
good,"No tienen buena paga al empleado... y no todos trabajan al mismo tiempo, eso quiere decir que el trabajo no es por producción."
good,It is a dead end job. Not for people who want to move up in a company. Too much work stress on the team leaders. They would not hire enough help for everyday production
good,es una empresa que da un buen sueldo pero el trabajo es muy pesado y con poco descanso
good,"The Work is easy. Most of the time you are busy if you know more works."
good,"As an overnight supervisor, Hours were tough. 12hr shifts, 7pm - 7am. 3 on 2 off. Team I led were awesome, however upper management was a joke. "
good,I worked with a machine that has a robot arm. I learned how to change parts over. The hardest part of the job was training others unfamiliar with the machine. The most enjoyable part was being able to talk to other co-workers freely.
good,"Always sweating to meet deadlines, print quality always had to be double checked and just too much work for too few printers.  Reprints were common.  Did a lot of extra work on the back end to ship an acceptable product."
good,"Working for RRD is has been an enjoyable experience, it was a good company to begin my career with to harness and sharped my knowledge and skills. I enjoyed my job, at the end of the day, I felt the satisfaction of an honest days work.   Every task or responsibility assigned was completed with full effort and attention to detail.  "
good,Time  Limits on some jobs are short/ to many hours or not enough hours not family friendly enjoyed most of the people  standards higher for some people
good,"I have loved the people I worked with but the culture has become too negative, losing people and not replacing them has caused undue stress on the rest of the teams. Irrational expectations and time limits placed on duties have created a very stressful atmosphere."
good,The people there make the job worth going in everyday.Mangement is horrible and they don’t follow the company rules in place they often make up there own rules as needed for certain people and situations.
good,"The one good thing about the place is we get a lot of time to work and progress on our actuarial exams."
good,All I can remember from this job was working 13 days straight on 12hr shifts.  We only had every other Sunday off and it was VERY difficult to maintain a work/life balance ESSPECIALY with young kids.
good,"Great place to work except for not enough Staff. You can’t get 2nd shift filled and Management does not Help. "
good,"It’s a nice place to work .a quiet place to work,in neat .The people their are real nice in friendly... always willing to help you. A good in safe place to work."
good,"Management cares very little for their employees.  Hours are demanding and accomplishments are not rewarded.  Insurance is poor, and job security is unsure."
good,The company wasn't employee friendly. Most of the time i felt like a number and my opinion didn't matter  Long work days  made you feel that you could always be relaced at any time
good,Great pay! But benefits are garbage. No pention or 401K match. They can change your hours daily. You leave just about every day with ink on you. Some managers are idiots
good,"RR Donnelley is basic employment for someone that just wants a paycheck.  If a person is highly motivated and wants to be able to advance, this is probably not the place to be, if you are content with simply getting paid a guaranteed hourly rate with benefits, this is a good job.  There was plenty of overtime."
good,"Lots of work for the money they paid. "
good,Fast paced work environment. Load paper into machines and box books. It's not a bad job overall but it is very repetitive. Just so you pay attention to what your doing and keep up with the machines your fine.
good,"When you are in an industry that uses paper for their main product to send statements, bills, notices, etc., in today's world that is dying out quickly. Lots of companies have gone paperless or offer incentives to go paperless and that cuts into the printing industries workload greatly each year. While it is a good paying job, the job security down the road is shrinking each and every year."
good,"work with pressman to print signatures for magazines, Set up stacker, changing plates, and whatever if needed to ber done. "
good,Like all companies RRD has its good and bad.  I have been able to have a successful career for 24 years and enjoyed a majority of my time at this company.
good,"Good management and friendly team... improve to develop skills and make life balance and keep reponse to finish our work in time, and have good dinner for free."
good,trying to reinvent itself in a mature declining industry. Split into three seperate companies with the future yet to be seen. Core business in decline from electronic media.
good,Overall the pay was good and is what really kept me there. Through the years benefits cost got higher. Management was very poor there. But very easy place to work for.
good,"High volume of projects and a large variety of customers/products; great working with all types of vendors and print platforms. "
good,"The account has 3 lines of businesses - Australian, Singaporean and  Filipino. All cater to insurance. I was assigned to the Australian one and the salary was low but the job was easy."
good,"The management needs to value each of its employees. Not much scope for upward movement. Low compensation compared to the reputation of the company. Management needs to look after the interest of all employees, not just the top level."
good,"the company culture is very corporate, though it does not offer the benefits of a big corporation. The Translations dept doesn't have any funds for decent technologies,and there is lots of micromanaging."
good,"12 hour shifts with only a 1/2 hr break. good co workers, and good pay. entry level is backbreaking work. be prepared to go home sweaty every day"
good,"Typical day at work involves meetings, planning, quotes, management projects/production, and selling. There is very little room for growth as far as management. In sales you are stuck. Depending upon the office, its all work, very quite, and a very small work environment. We used to meet and get to know the other regional sales reps and have performance reviews and awards as a region, but no longer have that. Budget and spend is limited, so it is hard to get approval to travel and be with the customer when production requires. The job does allow you to plan and manage your own work day, which is a plus when there are so many moving parts and people to manage."
good,Worked 55-65 hour week on site with client. Management was slow to respond to the needs of the on site staff. Did not respect the work and additional hours put in by employees across the platform.
good,"its a job but if you don't suck up to supervisors you will go nowhere, & if you get hurt or you don't hold up to certain supervisors expectations even though you follow Donnelley proticals they get rid of you. first they will try to make you quit but if that doesn't work they will make up a way to fire you."
good,"Hours 9-5 M-F Good co-workers. Nice building in a good location."
good,work hours flux to much one week ur getting hrs next ur working one day . the hardest thing about the job is not getting enough hours all the time  . the most enjoyable part is the people there .
good,Een bedrijf waar je jezelf kan ontwikkelen op allerlei gebieden. Alleen er is geen sprake van doorgroeimogelijkheden.
good,"packer and helped on the machine"
good,Productive workplace with less opportunities for advancement due to favoritism.
good,Difficulty in range of shifts constantly switching to and from. Difficulty with management to implement even the smallest change. Enjoyed the creation of training manuals and testing software.
good,"Enjoyed my tenure at RRD, dealing with different managers was very challenging."
good,I started with no knowledge in printing as a material handler handling finished product. I have a willingness to learn so i have worked my way up on offset printing. Now a rolltender i load paper into a running press and in charge of daily job change.
good,Good people to work with. Worked nights and weekends. lots of O.T.
good,RRD has shut down other plants and transferred their business to Pontiac. At some point it will be their turn as well.
good,"Was pretty easy to adapt to the schedule, but some of the jobs were very heavy & fast pace "
good,What happened to my job?? It became a go go go job all day long trying to do a good job without the right tools or personal. Just get as much done as quick as possible (good or bad) so management had good numbers to show corporate! Everyone work so hard and very little appreciation!  
good,nice place to work very slow not alot of job security. leaned alot as far as relame delame as weel as color match and cold stamp 
good,I got to design and put to gether comercial printing presses along with other senior engineers. I learn Allen Bradely and TI PLC control systems.
good,The work was labor based and fast pase which is nice for people with high energy the management and supervisors were lacking in communication skills and the schedual doesnt allow for a personal life
good,My typical day at work is packing u.s. mail on 3rd shift. What i learned was patience. The management there was ok. The co-workers there were very friendly. The hardest part of the job was staying awake. The most enjoyable part of the job.
good,"A empresa não tinha a cultura de recrutar pessoas de dentro ""de casa"" e sempre fazia recrutamentos externos, o que desmotivava muito os trabalhadores que tinham capacidade para crescer. Aprendi muito na área de Qualidade, principalmente com a Norma ISO que me norteou um monte de princípios que levo até hoje. A minha gerência era muito taxativa e cobrava muito, mas ao mesmo tempo era muito flexível e disponível. Os colegas eram muito disponíveis, sempre prontos para audar. A parte mais difícil era bater de frente com a presidência em alguns aspectos importantes e necessários. A parte mais agradável era resolver problemas."
good,A fast paced environment with large work load. Various systems.
good,Hard working and honest and friendly employees also need a better pay job a lot of overtime position I Enjoyed thus company but they moved to another location
good,"I was with RRD during the time the company was undergoing plant closures across the country. At the time, they had just divided into 3 parts so was and perhaps still is in transition. The plant I worked for was affected eventually with layoffs from the top down and I was part of the group of folks who were let go. I enjoyed my brief time there, made some good connections and friendships. Great benefits, decent pay, good work environment."
good,No company paid benefits no bonus program no 401k match the few things we had they took away  over the few years I've been there we use to have a company party they stopped that
good,Just a temp job through SDS services they only pay 7.25 on hour. Didn't like the 6 weeks days then 6 weeks night. Didn't know if u was going to get to work after driving there.
good,"Typical 9-5 M-F cubical job. How stressful or relaxed your life here is varied on what account you are on. The Healthcare accounts are very stressful. Navigators (the go between of you and the client) can be rude and unprofessional and often are doing the exact job you are, but getting paid more. I see my manager maybe once a day, but very approachable if I need to talk to them. The work environment is very mean girl and catty. Some employees will talk down to you and be so mean you will break down and cry. Quick to gossip and throw you under the bus for anything. Be prepared to handle 3 or more account all the while getting paid the same. If you work here long enough and ""prove"" your worth, you can get a small raise and a company lap top to take home. This is a catch 22. You can be at home on your off time relaxing, and the boss will call you to hop on your lap top to fix something or address a problem. Even on the weekends. But if your sick or the weather is bad, you can stay home and ""work"","
good,I truly enjoyed my job and the people I work with ! I just couldn’t keep being switched around and not being paid the difference in pay. I felt like I was under paid and over work
good,I enjoyed working with them. Respectful. Easy to get along . Very busy but easy to work with management.  I learnt to work with many different processes. The culture is quite warm and welcoming. The hardest part of the job is not hard to accomplish task. I enjoyed working with my co-workers.
good,"Fata de visão e planejamento a médio longo prazo. Os responsáveis precisam dar ouvidos aos que estão no chão da fabrica envolvidos diariamente em todo o processo produtivo,  tanto que a empresa veio a decretar falência no  Brasil."
good,"A great job for a long time. Eventually jobs were sent overseas to increase RRD profits. Corporate greed won out over employees. Overall, I enjoyed my time working there."
good,"A typical day would included printing customer information on a Xerox digital printer, I often rotated to different departments such as kit building and shipping. Often used powered industrial vehicles to move product around and order pulling."
good,"decent place to work, lots of overtime, usually forced. good foreman and people to work with. older equipment and not alot of training involved in their plant."
good,Can't say I remember much about working here but I know it was very boring work and was being paid enough as a temp. Wasn't worth working there at all
good,"Management doesn't look out for the employees or the facilities."
good,Do your job and don't make friends. If you work harder than others its alright because you are doing your job and not mingle with others.. Stocking everyone's area with material. Assistant when need to be in another area of the assembly line. Clean your area up before you leave and stock up for the next shift or day.
good,"Great people who try hard.  Although the culture is well intentioned, the company values long term employees who have knowledge of operations but disregards newer technology and automation.  In other words, old ways are being held onto and changes in technology are being implemented too slowly.  This is driven by fear of losing employment. The company is in a dying industry and is not meeting their customers needs quick enough.  Management is well intentioned but lacks the courage to make the needed changes. Also management lacks the day to day understanding of the issues that surround the lower level employee (internal customers).  The hardest part of the job is the month end close process.  The most enjoyable part of the job is times when the company goes out of its way to recognize the hard work that the employees do and express their appreciation when an employee goes above and beyond."
good,"Not alot of opportunity for advancement, the culture is slowly changin. Advancement movement is sideways, over worked if you prove to be capable and underappreciated as well.   Hopefully company moves forward as time progresses. Better oppertunity in digital print department and pay as well."
good,It wasn’t the greatest place I’ve ever worked. The managers are nice but there was a lot of disorganization there. The pay was horrible. It’s a small place so there aren’t a lot of employees.
good,"It was typical factory style work, I was in the offline department. We were only temporary employees because the company was going under, and the location is now closed."
good,The work was very challenging.  Specialists must keep their skills up to date in order to successfully produce documents that will always be proofread and analyzed by your superiors.
good,Company has experienced significant internal changes due to splitting into three companies. It is also affected by continuous technology changes and ways in which its customers conduct their business.
good,I like the people here.  There is very little opportunity for advancement without relocation.  No bonuses for several years due to management decisions far away from our plant and team.
good,"Fast paced and a lot of heavy lifting with some negative ppl in charge,  but if you do your work  their shouldn't be a problem,  and a lot o friendly ppl"
good,The benefits are terrible but if you're willing to work and learn somethings the pay is good!  What benefits are important to you?Its easy to move up and generally doesn't take long at all.
good,"Production schedule built daily with customer priorities needed to build order and ship. As a Supervisor we have to get the orders material picked by a material handler, checked in and verified by a Team Lead and Quality Inspector before staging on a Production line for assemblers to build. Orders have to be closed out in .Net application and stowed in warehouse rack locations. Shipping picks quantity for customer shipment scheduled and confirms order has left the dock via Carrier."
good,We were bought buy RRD and thought that i had the chance of moving up and growing with the company. I just feel that with the experience that i have doesn't go with my pay.
good,"No room for advancement, low pay, very low pay increases if any at all, zero merit raises, high benefit premiums with even higher deductibles. Work environment can be hostel and management does nothing about it."
good,"I can only speak on my particular sales office.  The majority of the people there are very nice, but the work environment/culture needs help.  Healthcare is provided, but it's so expensive it felt like I was just working to afford it.  They are a bit behind the times (computers, chairs, PTO documentation)."
good,"Many thing have changed since I left, so I can not make a fair assessment.I did not like the work environment and the work that was being produced was being phased out."
good,"The printing industry has been contracting for years, and the mergers and spins have spawned layoffs every 12-18 months to try to control costs. Getting a promotion to another team leaves you more vulnerable to layoffs in a last-in-first-out WFR scenario. Couple that with falling stock prices, no 401K match and annual insurance premium costs with scaled-back benefits and it's hard to justify remaining loyal to the company."
good,"Managing customer accounts and setting up logistic shipments by email request."
good,They show favoritism on 3rd shift I don't agree with that. I believe in a fair opportunity and they do not work like that the super visor is a good dude and helps out when it's needed the lead is horrible
good,"Fine place to work, easy to work independently. Unfortunately, many things would go wrong in the warehouse that would force us to be unproductive for several hours at a time. On days that everything was working well, the day went by quickly."
good,"Maintain the financial forecast for a cluster of customers.  "
good,"I am a people person, so my favorite part of the job was getting to see so many different people though out the day. You can form some great friendships with your coworkers."
good,A good place to work but work load was up and down. The company hired a new sales team to increase Sales but had to downsize due to lack of work for employees.
good,riding around on pick forks picking orders as quickly as you can and taking products to right destination for shipment. Helping others and keeping a productive count on picking items
good,"Good work for seasonal people, but not for people who have families looking for stable work. I had been working with the company for 7 months and got laid off just recently."
good,"Some repairs are challenging due to age of some of the equipment."
good,"A typical day at work would involve supporting applications and users in the day to day use of the application services that the company has provided, both user facing and customer facing."
good,"Employee benefits have been reduced to bare minimum however responsibilities continue to increase."
good,It was a fun to work with a good knowledgeable team with interesting conversations related to work and otherwise. The interactions proved helpful in gaining knowledge.
good,I spent a lot of my work life there. I worked with a lot of great people and saw a lot of changes. The people are the best part.
good,This job requires you to stand in one place for 9 hours packing junk mail. THATS IT. you cant move or do anything until your told to. The ppl are friendly but the way things go there suck.
good,"We work 12 hour shifts making a long day but does provide for days off. "
good,"shift rotation every 4 or 5 weeks, 10 cent raise every year. ok starting pay. 6 hr shifts might not be enough. some press operators do think they can talk to you how ever they want if they feel u won't talk back."
good,RRD was a hostile environment. Many people were hard on other employees. It was sometimes hard to keep my head up because I'm naturally a happy person.
good,"The employees are great to work with. Very friendly. The company only cares about quantity, not quality. Supervisors play favorites. The quality of work is bad because supervisors don't care. They have their favorites who they allow to get away with anything."
good,Working at RRD is quite an experience while working with fellow team mates is a rewarding and is a family type of environment.
good,"Enjoy my job, but management is lacking."
good,"All colleague have a positive mind. "
good,it is just a job they do not treat the employees there worth. The vacations not good and the snack machines are over priced
good,Physically demanding @ times.  Work-life balance is great.  Some mandatory OT.  Slow periods = mandatory layoffs for lower seniority people.  Pay is good but the benefits are expensive.
good,I worked 3rd shift so the hours were from 11 p. m. to 7 a. m. but often had to work until 11 a. m. on short notice. I learn to how to nrun a new hiedleburg touch screen folder that was interesting. The management left a lot to be desired. Some coworkers were good to be with while some others were not. The hardest part was no supervision on the floor at night. The most enjoyable part was leaving on time in the mornings.
good,"My most enjoyable part of the job was being able to constantly learn about FASB, internal, and external best practices. There were times in which downtime allowed for additional training to continuously gain more knowledge about the position. The most difficult part of the job was the work hours during peak times. Working an average of 60 hours for 6 to 7 months out of the year, became very difficult. Working with a wide range of people with different knowledge base, I was able to learn a lot from my co-workers as it pertained to accounting."
good,"Ok place to work. Management is ok, good coworkers, all employees have good attitudes, the hardest part of the job is 14 day shift change. I like trouble shooting all the problems that occur."
good,the job is very simple. all you do is pick books off the racks which is all is the area that you work. then put them in a box and send it back onto the conveyor belt to the next aisle.
good,"- Review orders with my supervisor, "
good,Retouching and color correcting numerous projects for many catalog and magazine customers.  Work directly with customer via phone calls and color shows.  I very much enjoy working in photoshop.
good,"Little to no advancement opportunities.  Large company easy to hide but don't expect much. 1% raises, family time is not valued."
good,Learning new skills and colleagues are good. Need more attention to details
good,"Nice co members"
good,I have learned a lot about Procurement and ERP through this company.
good,I work within a group of 5 co-workers under 1 manager. I make sure that the freight that is produced in the plant is shipped on the right truck and at the right time. I have learned a lot about the logistics industry as I had no experience when I was hired. The management is good. I love my coworkers - they are great and easy to get along with.
good,"acquiring paper for jobs and setting up splices"
good,"Conditions désastreuses de reprise par un imprimeur local novice dans la fabrication du mailing personnalisé en ligne"
good,"We delivers the products ontime to Customer."
good,"It's very inky, dusty and repetitive, but all in all not that bad. Great people to work with. You can get bumped to a different shift every three months and I needed something steady as I have young children at home."
good,"Going to work every morning was good. I've learned a lot as a assembler. The work wise is quite relaxing but sometime it has it up and down. Most of my employee are very fun to work with and working with them makes the work environment fun. The hardest part about this job is the communications. When something goes wrong, everyone seem to point finger at one another because of bad communication. It always the blame game. Stressful! But the most enjoyable part of the job is probably going to work knowing you get pay every week and the employees."
good,"My first long term employment. Pay was decent. Advancement was difficult if management did not like you. Work day was stressful as well as long, 12 hours long and there were times when you might work 5 or 6 12 hour days in a weeks time."
good,"typical work day is driving around on a forklift putting loads of stock paper away or taking them to the binding lines, taking loads of finished books and wrapping them and staging them to be shipped out."
good,"Managed 2 large photo studios in Charlotte, NC and New York, NY. Traveled often between the two sites. Managed a team of more than 50 producers, photographers, retouchers, photo operations specialists, merch coordinators, stylists, assistant stylists and digital technician. "
good,"I really enjoyed my co-workers and the environment. It was difficult to balance life with work due to the unknown hours from week to week. However, I became accustomed to the hours."
good,"One week before Thanksgiving we were all told that the Nacogdoches CSC was being made into a ""Micro-Hub"" and they would only keep 5-7 people out of 33. RRD is a big company with their eye only on the bottom line - only. They outsource to India and they tout this One RR Donnelley mantra but in all reality it only means that it's each location for itself and each location will only do what they want to do when it benefits them. Local management is ho-hum. If you aren't in your supervisors good graces then you will not get promoted or a decent raise. I did have one really great supervisor, he that made sure that I got promoted within a few months on the job. Even though he wasn't always my supervisor, I trusted him enough to go back to him when I needed something."
good,"Working at RR Donnelley provided me with a lot of good opportunities to learn and develop professionally and personally. It is currently focused on transitioning it primary revenue from printed materials to more of a data management, distribution and communications concentric company. Due to this change and the overall economy it is a challenging environment to work."
good,"Estou satisfeita,pois estou recebendo direitinho e sendo bem tratada,está me ajudando muito a pagar minhas contas.Estou aprendendo muito á trabalhar em máquinas diferentes,tenho ótimos colegas de trabalho.Tenho um bom lider."
good,Unloaded LTL trucks containing materials to be used within plant operation using PIV’s.
good,"The printing industry is barely able to survive, and RRD is no exception. The ship is sinking abd they are throwing neccessities overboard in oder to stay afloat."
good,"Trabalho leve ,não cansativo."
good,"I worked for the company for 11 years, the last 6 I was a forklift driver. I used a scanning system to track and control materials stored. The company did not give good raises or provide good benefits. They did not work with employees who were in need of time off for family/personal needs. We specialized in telephone book printing and manufacturing which the demand for has steadily decreased in recent years."
good,"Don't plan on a life outside of work. The usual is 12 days straight on, mostly 12 hour shifts, and then 2 days off, if you're lucky. They can require you to work 19 days before they HAVE to give you a day off. It will pay the bills, and if you're a decent worker, you will have no problem with job security."
good,productive and fast paced but great for building character.
good,Very large printing company tring to stay ahead of declining industry. Management top heavily and non-stable employment.
good,"The only thing that i liked was the pay check, and my position. Management needed more training. And they always said they were family oriented that was not true."
good,"It was fun and safe working enviroment. Gained alot of experience. Data entry, creating manifest, building mail pallets, tracking international mail.."
good,It's an ok job some of the coworkers are good people but you also have a couple of bad apples. You have the opportunity to learn different machines and labels that you run. It's a good experience an a good paying job.
good,"Really nice work environment"
good,"It was good working with RR Donelley they have a good work culture , Salary is something they have to keep an eye on and Employee benefits as well & management is okay overall my rating would be  5/10."
good,Overall it was a frustrating experience working at RR Donnelley.  I was the only hoist operator on third shift responsible for all presses whereas all other shifts had multiple people.
good,Estuvo bien pero no es un salario justo y aun cuando dicen que tienen plazas abiertas no contratan a personas nuevas ...
good,i got alone with the people i worked with .my most enjoyable part was that i get to help people out if they need it. the place was a very clean.i worked in the blue room with baby formula and the supervisors was very nice and help full
good,"Lots of 12s and they really try to work around the 6 day law rule. The company may soon be out of business due to the fact they print phone books, ads, crosswords, etc."
good,"Providing a print and mail service as cost effectively as possible to meet customers service level agreements."
good,Competitive work environment. if they like you they like you if they don't it can be a problem. Training is poor there. The work is hard but interesting.
good,"No raises, pay is not competitive, large workload, no career path or opportunity for advancement:"
good,I really enjoyed my job and my co-workers. My only complaint is there's no room for growth. On multiple occasions I was prevented from transferring to a new department to advance my career because I was needed in the department I was in.
good,There's nothing here that will blow your mind. I can say I have security in my job but at this point there's nothing more I can learn. I feel stuck almost.
good,Was told it has gotten a lot better over the past two years after I left. It's not too difficult to move up if you an interest to learn. The work involves some physical activity but it is not that bad. Plus the people are great.
good,Working at RRD wasn't that bad in terms of the job itself. Work started early and a typical day was never too stressful although some days could be very hectic. Management was my biggest issue. They were completely disconnected from warehouse work and had no idea how people did anything and would make unreasonable demands based on misinformation. Also there was a culture of seniority that made many aspects of the job very unfair. A few of the long time workers received a huge advantage and had opportunities that were denied to newer employees. They often fired people based on one of the senior people simply not liking them and didn't even consider their work habits or ethic.
good,Work is reward.  Insignificant raises and less than described bonuses mentioned in hiring process. When people leave they are not replaced and workloads get distributed amongst remaining employees.
good,"Internal operations of company in certain sites can use work."
good,"I enjoyed the work and learned many facets about Grand Format production; however, management was poor, stressful and you never knew where you stood with this person.  Was much more comfortable giving out harsh criticism than praise.  Could not motivate in a positive way.  Only gave negative feedback."
good,"I spent 5 months working at RR Donnelley, I found the work very easy, it is very repetitive at times though. Enjoyed my time there but there are so many staff on temporary contracts (including me) and you can be let go at any time so no job security whatsoever and it is frustrating because some people there do little to no work but they let people go who work really hard."
good,"Niewielkie możliwości rozwoju"
good,"The work was pretty relaxed, I enjoyed my time working there. It was a very well managed place to work and I had good training before I started. I only left due to relocation."
good,"I was almost never on the same line or in my area. This was mostly do to me being a level 1, which meant if there were ""too many"" people in my home area a level 2 could bump me out."
good,Muy buena experiencia... mucho trabajo en equipo.. buen ambiente laboral... buena disposicion para enseñar!!
good,"However,  in the many attempts I've made to get my job back, I have yet to be acknowledged.  Violence was threatened towards me and I I'm being punished because I removed myself from what was clearly a heated situation."
good,They are only concerned with the bottom line. Equipment is in poor condition and they refuse to fix anything unless it's completely down and even then they wait until the machine is needed to fix it. I liked working there for the first 10 years but it had become so bad I am retiring early.
good,I see RRD as a 19th-century company in the shrinking printing business.  It is trying to upgrade but the culture is fiercely resistant to change.  Agile works on the team level in the IT department but often managers are forced to make commitments for teams without consulting them.  I learned to be a scrum master here.
good,"was really hot and fast paced job, many job options, stacker, pocket filler, inkjet operator, card filler, once you got used to it, was pretty easy. could use better pay"
good,It was really hard to move ahead or even talk to your manager. There was a lot of he said she said and no actual help. When working there you are required to be perfect and no employee is. No help with emergencies or sick without a doc.
good,Work at the facility for almost 9 years.  Casual work environment.  Can be stressful at times.  The only reason that I left is due to lack of career advancement.
good,"No opportunities of improvement, very greedy and inexperienced  management, very old equipment to work with and upper management doesn't like to invest in new equipment ant train people."
good,"Work hard but company did not appreciated, management are not take care of the daily work flow, some customer service representative have to go do theirs sort out the item and provides job ticket for the prepress department to work on."
good,I started my career at RR Donnelley  on Sep 2014 as a Customer Support Associate. Training period was good and it was fun. Trainer was very friendly and she cleared my doubts every time. RR Donnelley work atmosphere is good you can feel like home. I was in call center operations Team and I enjoyed working over there.
good,You get a lot of promise but a difficult way to earn your keep. Try and get the best start you can because there is little chance for improvement. There is a lot of favoritism and others judge you before they know you.
good,I gained valuable experience. My background is based on sales an that is where I want to be. I would go back to work to RR Donnelly in customer service.
good,"I wasn't with them for long, but all I can really say was that it was fine. When I was hired they didn't really ask me what I'd be good with, they just put me in manufacturing pamphlets/spiral bound books. Days were boring and dragged on, but the conditions were good and the people generally friendly."
good,"You start off as a temp to hire but takes 6 months to 3 yrs to get hired on. low pay $10-12 an hour. 36 hours 1 week, then 48 hours next week. Management is good and same with the employees."
good,Confused management - objectives and directives continually changed. Typical was contradictory information/directives. Told by higher management that we were to do X and then later told to do Y by local management.
good,"We had company break policies as do all companies. We took break every hour, at quartly meeting it was brought up that need to stick to break policy, but u who are running over 100%. And we can a consistent 136% that made you feel good"
good,"The job was fast paced but most people could keep up "
good,"Enjoyed my time at this company, left for a chance to improve my skill set.  I had a great team while I was there and led a group that was committed to inventory reduction."
good,Some things they offer are great like phone discounts. There is a huge lack in organizational skills. All the people that run it are engineers and not business savvy. They do not take care of their employees enough and in turn the quality of work is horrible. Raises have been 1% for the last 8 years. They need to become more competitive and provide incentives or as minimum wages rise they will struggle to find quality employees.
good,"They need to be more competitive with their pay, especially since manufacturing is expected to work a lot of OT hours, sometimes at the last minute. Management team could be a little more professional."
good,"Buen ambiente laboral,compañerismo,medico de empresa y soda.conforme con la empresa"
good,"trabalhei por duas oportunidades temporárias, nessa empresa, através da agencia global que também é uma ótima agência."
good,Jobs were placed on senior operators and junior operators did not carry the same amount of responsibility.  Healthcare was very expensive and not very good.
good,"As a manufacturing supervisor I would deal with many people on all shifts which I found enjoyable but because of the short staff, it made for some very long hours."
good,"Operate 5 and 6 color sheet fed printing presses with a helper or by yourself.  Review job schedule for specifics and gather stock, plates, ink and color proofs.  Set up press do make ready and run.  Return unused inventory to warehouse and ink room."
good,Fun place to work in the beginning but then my manager was fired and then things were not fun anymore. I reported to someone who had a death wish for me.
good,"Before the merger with Moore Wallace in 2004 it was a much better company. After the merger things went downhill fast. Each year it seemed more benefits were cut, with the pension being froze at the end of 2011."
good,"I was very close with my co-workers, but the overall corporate culture was not good. Management team was aloof and didn't seem interested in the team's issues. I loved my clients, but ultimately the lack of advancement opportunities caused me to leave after nearly 11 years."
good,"I currently work as part of the Pittsburgh RSC Team located at the Pittsburgh print location."
good,All what they care it there production numbers! Poor maintenance performance and older equipment makes machine operators day full of stress and challenges. Running older equipment to the ground.
good,"My typical work day consisted of keeping upkeep of my work day and continuously loading rolls of paper into my machine. I would keep my machine running through my eight hour shift. I learned the basics of the style of factory, and that it's not all to hard. The management wasn't all that bad but the communication could have been better."
good,"nice place to work, really good people on both shifts, learned a lot about troubleshooting from my supervisor and the maintenance tech, also the I.T. guy."
good,"For the most part I enjoyed what I did, but it was a stressful environment. The communication was better than most other places and co-workers got along well."
good,There was no opportunity for me to advance in a career with this company.  My career options were limited and I was not afforded the schedule flexibility that I needed.
good,"This is a good company to work for, however it is very slow paced work environment with lots of bureaucracy.  The daily work can be boring if there is not project going on,"
good,It is a five day work week and no scope for learning anything new. The management is very lackadaisical and does not care about the employee. Not Good.
good,"My regular open procedures would be open up the Mailroom, due security checks, prep the facilities team, verify all jobs are done help out duplicating if necessary.  In the mid afternoon I would turn over mailroom, and then go to facilities and help prep the day.   I would then go to duplicating to see if they need my assistance, and last then I would go over to the office services side and verify everything is working properly.  After all that I would be able to go to my desk and work on reports.  Around 2 pm I would get up and make sure everything is running properly and relieve a couple people for lunch.   I have a daily meeting at 3 pm and then help out the facilities team.   After all that I would go downstairs to get ready to go. "
good,"I'm writing this review because Indeed requires a user to do so. If you have an opportunity to land a job at RRD take the job, learn the industry, and move on if you want to."
good,The location was grossly understaffed and overworked. Management was disjointed. Pay for low level workers was minimal. Benefits were almost nonexistent.
good,"Depending on seasons, you can have a lot of work or very little."
good,"They are almost non-existent at this location. They have laid-off most of the employees and what are left, are barely hanging on."
good,Its a corporate place bottom line is they wanna make money for stock holders very demanding wanting you to work alot of hours and not very appreciative of what you do
good,"The work load is not constant and you always have to find work. I like to be busy and productive. The work is the same daily. There are no surprises. Receive orders, bill orders, and fax in for payment."
good,"As far as the people who work here they are very cooperative and friendly. But as a company it seemed benefits were slowly being taken away every year, no match on 401k or HSA . Yearly 2% wage increase doesn't keep up with inflation."
good,"If you are interested in money, but not free time, this place is perfect. The pay is decent and the opportunity for overtime is impressive, but it is difficult to have a separate life away from the company."
good,"Strong focus on the numbers, often at the expense of the individual work/life balance.  Lean and mean is the best description.  Great environment if you can dedicate 12-18 hours per day."
good,Doesn't understand If u have family issues/ deaths I missed one day because my aunt died and they let me go without any questions and when I told them they said they can't do nothing about it
good,Opportunity to work at many levels and with multiple customer and products as well as cutting edge file management. Raised my skill levels in many areas and improved my people skills. Able to take responsibility for several projects and work directly with customers.
good,RRD has a relaxed working environment but offers little opportunity for growth. The leadership seems to be very political wherein promotions are primarily based on relationships and not on merits of the performance.
good,Ok place to work it has put food on the table but they have cut benefits to almost nothing. I started at the bottom and through hard work and self study I progressed up through the ranks fairly rapidly
good,"Great place to learn if you're willing to put yourself out there.  Minimal management support or backup.  If you thrive in a CYA environment, this is the company for you."
good,"My typical day at work is checking email, and voicemail to see if any missed pick-ups. Check my load board to see what my freight look like."
good,"Feeding 28 conveyors at a decent rate of speed to make the work shift go fast. also in the process jumping over the line and running up and down the line to get stops, clear jams, and help out,clean up any way possible."
good,Company required working a lot  of mandatory overtime.  Job and work/life balance was poor and it also had poor management.  It did provide good benefits.
good,"Not a bad place to work, but not a great one either. Prototypical ""big"" company with too much hierarchy, bureaucracy and politics."
good,"RR  Donnelley Global BPO, formerly known as Office Tiger is among the leading outsourcing companies offering judgment based industry focused solutions and executes complex onsite offshore outsourcing services on a global scale. Founded in 1995, our client include large investment and commercial banks, leading diversified financial service companies, insurance companies, law firms, publishing houses, utilities, pharmaceuticals and global retailers."
good,"Empresa boa, aprendi a ser mais atento e ter mais atenção e organização."
good,I really enjoyable to work there but I have facing the same client and job in this things for the past 4 years I got bored. I want to be learn new things that is main reason for looking a job a outside.
good,"too much politics     if management likes you personally you do as you please  not one of the buddies  you are watched   expected to make up for the others          door is always open but dont use it !!!!"
good,"when it is busy you can make a lot of money, but the down side or that is all the mandatory overtime and lack of free time your because of it. Then it gets really slow and people can get laid off and everyone loses hours so its not a very stable job."
good,"RR Donnelley provides excellent working atmosphere.I have learned a lot of things from RR Donnelley that should impact my life."
good,The hardest part of the job was the 12 hour rotating shifts on a 4 star schedule.  This is not a con but did not work for me and my family.  Otherwise it was a good place to work.
good,"My job is to adjust the inventory of the warehouse to keep it accurate and fix any boxes with problems before they are shipped. Training I received was largely memorizing item locations and system codes for warehouse information. It isn't difficult, but most problems that I run into daily can be avoided all together if certain aspects are monitored more extensively or altered slightly to be done a bit differently.  Ex: The replenishment crew often cuts into boxes in such a way that it hits products and damages them, or they put the wrong products in the wrong locations if they even put the product away at all (I would often find pallets of product I needed waiting to be put away hours after they had left).  Some pickers also had a bad habit of picking damaged products, picking from the complete wrong shelf, and/or never packing boxes properly before sending them along.  These are problems that I've seen lower and rise as the management on my shift changed multiple times since I've worked for this company. This has obviously causes many problems in different specific areas with each change which have been known to throw off the flow of work causing sudden very heavy overtime hours, most recently being working  mandatory 12-hour shifts all week and weekend shift (last winter we even had to work 3 weeks of 10-hour shifts with no weekends off at all).  However, with everyone whose come and gone, they have always looked to me and the rest of the QC crew as the go-to people when anything goes wrong and rely on us to fix any problems that arise. Personally, I feel we don't get much"
good,"I like to work here, coworkers are very nosey and worry about thing that they shouldn't.  room for advancement its slow slow slow. you work long hours too many days in a row.  there was nothing hard about my job at all. I enjoyed the responsibility."
good,I loved the people that worked there. They made the experience of working here a good one.
good,"The job itself was not hard at all,but that certain location had issues with certain management,I have not one time recommened this company to anyone,Iseen and heard things that were disrespectful towards many people"
good,"you rotate job skills each day."
good,Working with some great and skilled people on a greta variety of jobs.
good,Big company to work for. I enjoyed the people and the job. I have learned a lot of information working here as far as what happens in a production facility. I was a part of an ISO team.
good,"It was fun loving working there, except the shift timing , since i was in a rotational shift on a weekly basics. I have learnt many things like managing a team of 20 members.My team was working hard to achieve all their goals to achieve their SLA. The hardest part of the Job was my shift timing which was a completely rotational on a weekly basics on different timing. The most enjoyable part of the job was  every friday. I allocate time to my Co-workers to have a fun time for more than an hour. Depend on the Workflow of the Job."
good,Typical day was standing up waiting for them to find work to do. Didnt learn anything. Didnt see management much. Co-workers were cool people. Hardest part of the job was being on your feet all day. Nothing was enjoyable about the job
good,"Work is good. Cooperative co workers. work by hearing music"
good,"Lo que màs me gusto en la interacción que tenia con todo el personal, clientes internos y externos. El coordinar gente y estar inmersa en todos los procesos a través de la supervisión y seguimiento a cada proyecto. La solución a problemas y la parte de la negociación."
good,"•	Managing the Team."
good,"Co-workers were great to work with, travel to different sites was most fulfilling. "
good,"Attendance login, client interaction, query resolving."
good,"Good job with good people other than management."
good,Complete multiple task that involve assisting coworkers in completing their task and verifying quality of products before shipping to customers. Often a teamwork based enviroment but also occasionally individual task. Sometimes obtaining the standard of quality desired by the customer would prove difficult to achieve.
good,"Used to be a family oriented facility. Your just a body to get their product out, nothing more. "
good,"If a person is getting hired on at this company, make sure to ALWAYS get EVERYTHING promised in writing. Be sure it is clear and concise."
good,"Strict hours, but paychecks are good. but you do learn alot there such as job procedures."
good,"Worked in production control, worked on machinery when down, and inspected printed magazine pages for errors"
good,It was an good place to work. They needed a new head manager. He was terrible! I feel that's why the plant shut down.
good,RR Donnelley is a good company that is always trying to stay at the for front of of the printing business. There are always bills to be printed and mail to be sent so on a typical day you are always busy. You learn how to run large printing machines both A4 paper fed and also reel paper fed. The personnel are friendly and always willing to help. The hardest part of the job is making sure you have enough prduct to complete the job. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing you have completed and send your job on time and correctly.
good,"I had fun working at RR Donnelley. Every start of our shift we do have a meeting before starting our work. I have learned a lot from editing, proofreading legal documents. I have received individual and team award because of hard work and dedication to our job. My co workers are very friendly and they are like my second family. The hardest part of the job is we only have 1 day off. The most enjoyable is the camaraderie we have in the office."
good,Well my coworkers were great to get along with they taught me the ropes and it was okay until the 3rdnshift temps were let go for insuf hrs
good,"Variety of tasks to perform each day that keep the day moving...review inventory report, communicate critical shipments that must be shipped to ensure on time performance for customer satisfaction, review supplies status and place orders for replenishment as needed."
good,Work by myself. Little communication with co-workers. I learned measurement scales.
good,"Flexibility, Easily mingle with top management, Working hours is less"
good,"Friendly co-workers , management always there to help, quality problems was the toughest part of the job and fixing the quality was the best part of the job."
good,Very helpful and knowledgeable employees. Unfortunately the company is going through a work force reduction and cut many benefits.
good,life/work balance only one benefit. Poor salary low working ethic. Main problem at the company is poor management and lack of communication between production floor and management who firstly agree with everything what client demand then try to implement that to production process.
good,I worked at RRD for 4 years and learned a great deal of knowledge during my time there. Usually it isn't very busy until Q4 of the year or holidays season.
good,"You either like it at Donnelly or hate it. I was high on the ladder as a lead bindery operator, so fo me it was a good job. Not so much for other positions."
good,Have not given a raise in 15 yrs and they do not put money in your 401k no pention. Work alot of overtime because they dont hire enough people to do the work that needs to be done so u have to cross train to do more than one job.
good,For the past 2 years work schedule has been around 24 to 40 hours due to customers not having enough work for RRD. Management not truthful to employees about possible layoffs but they did give a package to employees they did layoff.
good,"Pay was the most I ever had. But depending on the client, it can be easy to almost impossible to please them. Got laid off, then was rehired to work in a separate department servicing the impossible client."
good,"Era una imprenta tan grande, que las cantidades de trabajo eran sofocantes, además del calor y la bulla dentro de la planta, era para trabajar con tapones en los oídos, 3 turnos rotativos, y turnos extras, la verdad. Traumante, pero aprendí a operar una máquina trilateral para libros."
good,"A definite job experience as well as a life experience but not something I see myself making a career out of. Management was poor, as none of them seemed to really care about the job at hand. More focused on pushing product out the door and not so much on quality."
good,working at Donnelley was not bad at first. then I was put with a line lead that thought he should run the machine as fast as it would go and sit back while the rest of us struggled to keep the line running. bad pages and bleeds spots was ok cause he was getting jobs done faster then others.
good,They should see more on their employees perspective..and learn to listen to their complaints. It is a good company with wonderful colleagues. But lesser opportunities to move up when it comes to career moves.
good,Great People and job culture. Flexible working environment. The pay is competitive. There's opportunity for advancement but relocation is most likely required.
good,"This was a plant and technical role. Good team environment. Solid company when I was there."
good,"Work environment is in a Pods setting- groups of 2 to 8 people.  Very talkative, very clicky.  If you need quiet to work hard environment to perform.  Management and promotions are hard to get."
good,Working at RR Donnelley had its ups and downs. The company pays well but the amount of work that is expected in a typical day can be challenging. Most of management is easy to work with.
good,"Decent job, poor benefit packages and high priced insurance . Overall clean work environment and room for advancement, but is somewhat stressful due to high turnover rate of general laborers"
good,"I worked here in Torrance, CA for 27 years. Made 3 promotions and topped out as a Press Manager ending in 2009. This was a great place to work and the people were some of the best I ever met. I loved printing and found it very challenging work. My number one complaint would be web breaks. (Anyone who's ever worked in printing will understand) My years here were rewarding and fun, but the reason I would not recommend it now is because, ""Printing is not going to last much longer"". But I sincerely wish my former colleagues the best in all that they do."
good,"No rate"
good,"I have been working here for 8 years. Free food (once a day based on shift timing), free beverages (coupons), free transport are the main best facilities offered by the company. Salary is much lower than market standards. The company gives more than required importance to fun at work, sometimes to level of distracting employees from work. Even though English is the official language, most of the associate level employees speak local language. Rules are not followed or enforced effectively. Company management encourage open communication up to a certain limit. Casual dress code."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was my co-workers.  The job itself was slow.  Work environment needs an upgrade.  They try to make up for the compensation by always providing food
good,The company is changing and it's culture is changing. It is a difficult time for companies in the print industry and this one is no different in that it is struggling to find a new direction.
good,Easy work for descent pay hardest part of the job is the third shift hours for me it was hard to keep on at first takes time getting used to. And management was good but some days they didn’t know exactly what to do with their employees
good,"Great company when I started, but the culture slowly turned sour. Many rounds of layoffs became the norm. Only a few accounts are keeping them afloat after the company split up. Not sure how much longer they'll keep the doors open."
good,"a very past pace unloading and loading truck, build wall of boxes and stock boxes as high as possible, winter time is the worse and also the summer the trucks feel just like what ever the weather is outside."
good,"It’s the kind of job you stay for a year or few but it’s not a career. Management was not knowledgeable, the operators ran the place more than the big guys which was frustrating. Lost customers a lot and had periods of being very slow."
good,"The work experience was very helpful ,the people could of been more organized.. I showed a big impact  with my leadership skills ..Always finished my work on time.. I'm a very quick learner and eager to learn new things .I also have great leadership skills."
good,rrd is currently closing many facilities throughout the country. The company split has not been good for the company or stock. Print is in decline and the company is scrambling to recover
good,"used to be great. benefits have been cut back every year ive worked here. as of writing this review most full time employees have been working mandatory Saturdays almost every weekend for the last year, so lots of overtime, but not great for work/life balance"
good,Upper management has lost the confidence of the people who make the money.  Too much focus on cutting costs and not enough focus on innovation or servicing the customer.
good,"Limited resources for lots of work, hence long days. Offers flexible work environemnt, management is great, paid time off days are generous, healthcare benefits are prohibitive, not comparable to industry."
good,Great positing and place to work. Management was exceptional. I enjoyed my time working as a pricing analyst. Was encouraged to think outside the box and provide timely quotes.
good,A company struggling to stay relevant as the print industry disappears. Most of the people are nice. Very little of what you learn can be applied to any other industry. There is very little management oversight of the tools used. Some people refuse to use anything not written in the 60s. Other use what ever they want and god help the person who takes over their work when they get bored and leave the company.
good,I really don't have anything to say about this company. Was there 8 1/2 yrs and worked my butt off. The money paid my bills but didn't have much of a life because we worked so much
good,I enjoyed my job. It was challenging and fast paced. Sometimes very stressful. Would have stayed til I retired. People were all dedicated to their roles and all had long term employment til our plant was closed.
good,"selling to large clients is great for networking"
good,Learned alot while employed here climate is not temp controlled and people are hard to manage supervisor does ok but the people are not a main concern.advancement is easy just need to show a willingness to learn and show up when scheduled....
good,"not a bad place to work, long hours, hot dusty people are friendly, paid days off good pay if you have to work a holiday can be hectic at times. management could use some work"
good,The days were pretty typical of an office job. Not overly stressful except at the end of the month or year. Coworkers were great. No room for career advancement.
good,"It used to be a fun place to work. Friendly folks and lots of creative challenges. Since the split, multiple layoffs and too much work for one person.  It's too bad tho.  It used to be a great place to work even tho the pay was below par."
good,Days here are just crazy they have alot going on. Now the working part is ok as long as everyone is working or doing what they suppose to be doing. What i like is that you not working alone this is a team job. What i dislike is everybody don't always work as a team. They Management really does suck especially if you are an temp.
good,great place to work for the money but the insurance cost increase(s) and removal of annual bonus making it hard to not look elsewhere for employment....another decent company being lost to the big corporate america movement.
good,"Good place to work with as a fresher"
good,"great people, over worked, poor benefits, expect to perform in lots of areas and hours. poor reward system. lots of exposure to programs."
good,"RR Donnelley was a hard and stressful job. With the swing shifts, it made it difficult to get used to the work hours. The older employees are difficult to work with most days but all in all, nice people that work there."
good,Good place to work for beginners and also a friendly environment. Can survive for long term in the company. I have learned about Quality Assurance techniques from this company.
good,Salary is ok more work load but same salary. Canteen is not ok. But there are many options outside. Guards and staffs are kind. Managers are easy to approach
good,A close knit group of people who expected everyone to have each others back. Had to work a lot of overtime. Old dirty building with wooden block floors. It was a place where you learned work ethic or you were gone.
good,"RRD (NYSE:RRD) ​is a global, integrated communications provider enabling organizations to create, manage, deliver and optimize their multichannel marketing and business communications."
good,"coworkers are nice , management not so good, company seems to be going down so looking for another job"
good,"very good place to work, good wages, climate controlled, on the decline lately due to new online applications, hopefully things turn around for this company"
good,"good company to work for as long as you are employed directly from the Company, well train staff, company provide good benefit package for full time employees."
good,the place was very fun and excitible to work at the managment was very organzied and always told the employess what was going on within the work place. i am glad i worked there
good,RR Donnelley is being broken into three separate companies.  These companies will have to compete with smaller more nimble competitors for a diminishing market.  Not a great time to get into printing.
good,"Nothing negative to say. I'm just looking for more of a career opportunity..... not just a job. I enjoyed my five years at RR Donnelley, but it's time for me to focus on my future."
good,Fast Pace and always alot of changes. Need to have the ability to adapt. Hardworking employees who are always willing to help.
good,good job great overtime good work environment great co workers good pay fast paced but steady work flow pace but most of all the good overtime
good,This place is full of drama where everyone talks about one another like high school. The work is easy though with good pay.
good,"I wish I could say that this was a great place to work, and for the most part, it was. Most of my co-workers were good to work with, but with anywhere, you're not going to get on with everyone. The pay is descent, depending on the department you are in. A typical day is usually very busy, three shifts are ran. There is mandatory over-time, every weekend, for almost every department. Depending on the department you work in, you may or may not get a lunch break, but instead 20 minutes. Some members of management are a bit duplicitous. The overall moral is pretty low, unfortunately. Benefits are nearly nonexistent; there is no pension, they offer a 401K, but do not match or add to it, and the medical is wretched."
good,this is time sensitive printing very high speeds in printing and binding the people are very helpful in the production process management sometimes looses what life is on the floor
good,"Yes. You heard that right. In order to get paid for a holiday, you must be employed for six months. The same holds true for promotion or transfer. The decisions are not made from the facility, rather the decisions are made from corporate headquarters. RR Donnelley has air conditioning. There is no mandatory overtime, just sign up and show up. Rules are enforced, don't push the boundaries."
good,"trabajaba horarios rotativos de 8 horas, en diferentes imprentas rotativas, he aprendido mucho sobre el manejo y mantenimiento de las maquinas."
good,I've been working here for almost three years and the management isn't that great. They lack communication and I don't see it improving  anytime soon.
good,Work each day presented a standard set of required tasks that did vary in intensity and expedience depending on the requirements of the customers. Knowing how to optimize your time and apply the relevant skills to meet those requirements was a critical component of the job. I enjoyed organizing and coordinating the orders efficiently to clients' continued satisfaction.
good,"Its a good place to work however, being a contractor its not same considering everything surrounded benefits sometimes working environment as regular employee. Otherwise it is good to work with that team ."
good,It's a good job according to the client deadline we have to finish that in time frame.we learn many new thing on each and every job it's a nice job we learn many thing in each and every day
good,"My years with RR Donnelley have been both enjoyable and stressful. I have had many different positions and was able to work at our 4 different locations.  With that experience, I have learned to work in many different environments and many different personalities."
good,"OK place to work overall. The bread and butter part of this company was commercial printing,and I worked in a telephone directory plant. Most of the employees were good people. Management was ok,but definitely had their favorites. The scheduling was horrible at times,and it was common to be laid off for a week in early summer. During busy times it was common to work 12 hours a day 5 to 6 days a week. during slower times you would get 37.5 hours a week,or possibly less,and/or be laid off. As a forklift driver,we had problems with our truck mounted computers the last 2.5 years I worked there,and they were never fixed. Profit sharing was good when I started,and terrible every year after. Raises were a joke! 2% was the best I ever got. Job security was not good. Overall,I still liked my job. I did learn more computer skills at this job,and became an excellent forklift operator."
good,My typical day started processing the necessary daily reports. I then would review the workload in the 3 areas I managed. Contact my workers and have daily meetings with both Management and staff. I enjoyed my job and position and really have no hard elements.
good,"I have worked at RR Donnelley for 23 years. I work in the bindery. My position is fast paced and has helped me learn how to pay close attention to detail, as it is very important to keep the pockets full of the right signatures and the machine running. My position has given me experience in warehouse machinery and manual dexterity. In addition, it has given me experience in working in a team environment. Every machine has an Opperator that oversees the proper running function and any problems that may interfere with production. My Opperator was always willing to jump in and help when needed, as we all helped each other when time permitted. I most enjoyed working side by side with my friends. The hardest part of my job was changing shifts every two weeks. However, after some time I have gotten use to it. Overall, I enjoy working at RR Donnelley."
good,"Hours that are required are typically on an off shift for example second or third shift. The pay compensation is very good and the benefits are minimal at best. Printing environment with busy hours and a lot of overtime with a lot of required overtime. Blue collar job dealing with people who sometimes have and abrasive or undesirable  attitude. Business sector that is being outfaced and makes constant cut backs do to the challenging market place, for example the cutting back of training programs and benefits."
good,"Cold calling and generating leads any way possible."
good,12 day in a row work weeks. 5 week shift rotations. Every other weekend are 12 hour days. On your feet most of the shift. Not managed well not putting any money back into the equipment. Co-workers are great people.
good,"Over the past few years RRD have seen a drop in throughput and and revenue however the company has continued to maintain it's profitability due to lean initiatives. It is a tough, fast moving environment which demands commitment and experience. I have learnt a huge amount during my time as a Lean Champion which has enabled me to apply lean thinking to the Supply Chain Role."
good,Steady employment in a dying niche of manufacturing. Overtime available if desired. Somewhat reactive culture while trying to be proactive.
good,"Es un empresa papelera que tienen todos los recursos solo el problema es que no hay  crecimiento laboral,el trabajo es por temporadas y pocos son aceptados cuando se acaba el trabajo"
good,"I have had the opportunity to work with one of the nation's leading single-source suppliers of gases, welding and safety products.  I served this customer in a pure account management role which afforded me the experience to learn many of the company's in-depth reporting tools and gain an even better understanding of inventory controls, best practices related to just-in-time printing and fulfillment and distribution."
good,"Facility closed and printing industry decline, caused me to leave.  But it was a good first job experience.  Nice place to work at that time"
good,They offer good basic pay but provides minimal benefits for employees. The company also offers very limited career growth to employees
good,I worked this job for 6 weeks. It was good pay but there were times that I didn't want to continue with that job. Worked with some machinery. I kept my area clean of trash.
good,"A typical day consists of arriving at 5:45 am to unlock the door, deactivate the alarm, and run the cyce count sheets and reports.  After the cycle counts are completed, I will proceed to print all the orders that need to ship and give to warehouse.  All throughout the day,I will monitor emails and respond accordingly.  Any inventory moves, receipts, and shipments run through my desk first and last to make sure that they been processed correctly."
good,"I am looking for work because my department is being shut down in March."
good,"Training will be held where you lack and continuous assessment will be done in order to bring you up."
good,"A typical day at work is fast paced environment that requires a lot of multitasking. Learning to change processes and procedures for the better are a daily goal. Always improving and always changing things for the good of all is our overall objective. Management is a well educated team of employees who work to improve time management, quality and quantity of our companies products and services. My co-workers are a diverse pool of employees with a wide variety of culture, ethnicity and race. The hardest part of my job would shift work and the most enjoyable part of my job would be getting the opportunity to meet new people everyday."
good,a good place to work.Management and colleagues are good.long hours some times bother us.
good,"Very fast work, Long shifts, Worked 31 days in a row most of them 12 hours."
good,"This is a decent place to work, The hours are there if you enjoy overtime.  Compensation is fair, decent pay for the work you do."
good,"In short, mostly chaotic. Things change so often, and there is such a lack of communication that it is usually left to the employees to pick up the pieces."
good,Learning and improving skills related to different work type. Also got involved in many social and charity events.
good,"Work required focus and allowed no room for errors. Learned to be detail oriented."
good,"This was actually a good place to work, there was one or two bad apples, a few tough job orders but thats everywhere."
good,"Governing CRM & Database Marketing programs and resources; the CRM Program Management team main focus was building Client Acquisition, targeting potential Cross-Sell prospects, and maintaining customer Retention. Encompassed with a team that included List Processing, Database (SQL) IT, Analytics, and Creative; RRD’s goal was to stay on target with programs, from concept to print, advise and direct best practices.  Oversee and Analyze client data to provide teachings and strategies that would provide solutions, cost effective strategies and build measurable results in regards to the Clients DM and Multi-Channel efforts. "
good,The global capital markets is somewhat of a productive group but the culture and salesforce is awful.
good,"I was an material handler and ran machinery.I have learnt working as a team increases harmony, increases production. The hardest part is shift work and raising children was a challenge at that time,thanks for my family!!!. I enjoyed working as a team and my supervisor"
good,"Os gerentes são bons tive ótimos colegas de "
good,I was a cycle counter at this job. Drove forklifts and picked product from warehouse racks. Learned how to drive sit down and stand up forklifts. Management was good. Co-workers were good. Not too many hard parts of the job. Most enjoyable part was the hours.
good,"Daily interaction with different departments to effectively complete tasks. I've learned to maintain a professional attitude with all circumstances. Management is great at trusting employees to be able to work with minimal supervision. There is no hard part of the day because I don't take work personal. The most enjoyable part of the day is, ending they day knowing I've efficiently completed duties."
good,I feel that this is  a company that does not reward employees for accomplishments or offer chances to grow within the company.
good,My ambition is to work soldier in my country in my current work experience is like a document specialist i like to work that field at the same time i interest to work any of the field i really like to work army in any department that's my only one ambition 
good,"heavy lifting , running machines, interesting work. To many temps who didn't care about the work."
good,"The whole business is based on mail sorting, scanning documents and data entry."
good,"I really enjoyed working for R.R. Donnelley. Management, and the staff were very patient, and welcoming! I learned that a material handler consists of more than just stacking store ads....you have to stack the ads in multiple patterns but consistent; to balance them. Also stack neatly, quality keeps a customer keep coming back. Majority of my co-workers were full of personality....which helped the day go by. I would have to say the hardest part of the job, was when the printing machine would have to be shut down for major paper jams, It causes the company to get behind on their quota, and schedule."
good,The people I work with are the best. The work is tough but there is a support system
good,"Long hours and last minute over time schedule, and couldnt tell a supervisor from a regular employee,and most of the employees you work with were unhappy being there"
good,"I would come in, check my voice mails, then my emails, and that would start off my workload for the day. After Customer Service got out of their daily meeting, I would touch base with them as to what print jobs I was quoting, and what print jobs were going to become live jobs. I had a lot of good co-workers that I was lucky to have on the same teams as I. I was on more than one team, which means I was doing the work of 2 or more people. They were slowly downsizing the company, making lots of extra work for several of us. Then they came through and laid off the ones of us that had been loyal, long term employees. The best part of my job was talking to the customers. I really got along with them and felt so good they felt they could talk to me instead of the sales person, who was out on the road selling. Management didn't work with me. She worked in another New England state which made it difficult to connect with her, and talk to her when I needed to. I didn't know her well at all."
good,Really not that bad of a place to work if the supervisors could get it together. People are pretty easy to get along with for the most part.
good,Global organization in printing and BPO outsourcing banking and legal accounts.
good,"Good start as a bpo fresher, but no point in staying for long. A few oppurtunities to move in to IT or other through internal transfer. Salary & benefits are very good compared to that of other companies in same domain. Managers are worst!"
good,RR Donnelly is your typical high production company.  They go all day and all night.  Good benefits and pay.  Must be top notch with your experience and position knowledge.
good,"Every day that I was at work, I packed paper and helped get the paper machine unjammed as needed. It wasn't a super difficult job, but the pay was more than fair for the work involved. I liked how I was trusted to work by myself for most of my shift"
good,"It depends on actual skill set that a person carry, those have proper designing experience can excel here and be treated special. Those who have customer service industry experience will have less scope to be better"
good,"É uma boa empresa, apesar de ser afastada. Tem um bom refeitório."
good,Was an experience work environment. I've Learned a lot. managed digital printers and work on rip fiery. Produce high quality production prints utilizing the onsite Xerox digital print equipment's to meet the needs of the client
good,"Work ambiance is good. Management also. But the only problem is Salary. salary is very less, comparatively other companies. Workplace culture is very good. They will conduct cultural and sports programs. Company wise competitions also they are conducting."
good,"It was an entry level position with no room for advancement and a temporary position. Minimum pay, average at best. The work was easy but there were just no room for advancement."
good,"Temporary product support specialist position, supporting XML Production Publisher and XSLT, producing Financial Documents for Mutual Fund Organizations and Investment Firms."
good,I loved working there. 25 years of service   I feel that should speak volumes. Great place to work. I felt like the company tried to keep up with the ever changing times and the print world.
good,"It’s a  job low pay no advancement  good for a while but need to move on to better things to far from home benifit not great, more company’s willing to pay more"
good,"The printing industry is a tough environment for most. It is difficult to compete if you are not re-investing into the most modern, efficient technologies."
good,Good place to work. Usually busy but have some slow times. I enjoyed the people but HR was the worst. Benefits was not the greatest. Would be better if the pay would raise as cost of living did
good,"Worked for RR Donnelley 26 years. Machine operator the entire time running Muller Martini and Harris type bindery machines. Daily responsibilities included setup,maintenance and troubleshooting problems on production line. Also managed crews consisting of feeders and packers."
good,"Creates a new environment for people to work with, always supportive."
good,Good company with reasonable employee benefits but poor salary package. No work from home options. Management should be little liberal and good thinking regards to salary package for their employees.
good,"Relaxed work atmosphere,  professional.  Easy going. Management practiced an open door policy. My manager was very knowledgeable and was available for training.  Beyond our office, which was small, there was no opportunity to advance."
good,The hardest part of the job was control the inventory because employees would put product in the wrong locations versus what the WMS staged. It was a hunt to find missing or mislocated product
good,I solved several large problems for them way outside of the duties for my position. I was not rewarded at all. Now Indeed is making me write a minimum of 150 characters so I wrote this
good,Easy work for you guys to come out and see if you can get a good night's sleep and I love you more than anything in the morning and I will be there at all good
good,"Can Learn and work more in a faster paced environment. "
good,"Minha avaliação é  sobre muitas mudanças principalmente diretoria, salário mediano, falta d promoções apenas uma empresa multinacional no nome mas à  realidade era outra. Pra mim uma empresa boa apenas ..."
good,I worked here for 20 years overall it a very good place to work. Management at the location I was at was sub par in my last few years. I would definitely consider going back in the future
good,When arriving to Donnelley you look on the board to see where you are to work that day. Then you go to your station and you work at that spot for most/all of your shift. I learned the importance of working as a team. if someone messed up the whole machine would stop and a red light would appear at the station where the mistake happened. The workplace culture was very loud and fast-paced. people moving and doing different things all around you. The hardest part of the job would be after lunch. Going back into the warehouse and getting back to work after a relaxing 30 minute break. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting paid. After working all those mandatory long hours it was worth it when the paycheck came.
good,"Wasn't bad job but corporate policies became increasingly more important than the people."
good,There was alot of experience coworkers ro learn from in a safe environment. Safety was a priority next to finishing our products on schedule. I always had plenty of hours
good,The loss of experienced operators and also the changing business enviroment has made this job very difficult. In addition to that the managment team is spread very thin.
good,Working for RR Donnelley is ok.  They use to be Wallace Computer Services.  Wallace was a great place to work for.  But management changes and requirements have drastically changed the atmosphere and mind set of most of the employees there. The job itself is actually fun.  You get to be creative in what you do to make the best looking and best in use of the  particular label you are designing or better said putting together. It requires a lot of focusing on what you are doing because you can waste thousands of feet of material in producing a bad or unusable labels.  You must have good dedication to coming to work and a fast learner with good reading with understanding and mechanical skills.
good,If you don't mind standing on your feet and being in a warehouse this place would be the place for you. The management team is always helpful with any issue whether it is personal or job related. Very diverse work enviroment.
good,"Was OK to work for , most people were good to work with, environment was good , supervisors work well with employees. Benifits were fair for the most part."
good,Good job a lot of good workers Learned a lot of different equipment Got along with all the employees and staff learned how to work on different equipment overall a good place to work
good,Pays the bills. Some aspects of the company are beneficial. Its not a difficult place to work for or at least the facility i was located at.Just some of the upper management were complicated people to work with
good,"Since it was my first work in USA, for the first quarter it was really difficult to coup up with others but eventually I was comfortable. All in all, it was great experience working at RR Donnelley."
good,"RR Donnelley provides a very robust working environment. They represent some of the biggest clients on the market and as such customer satisfaction and quality must be top priority. "
good,Our company was bought out by RR Donnelley. They shut-down operations shortly after acquiring our facility. The employees were not given very much notice.
good,"RR Donnelley is suffering the decline of the print world. They have found other avenues as a communications company, but little is invested in company culture or employee well-being. They overload the employees with job tasks after a certain amount of time. I was always in a constant scramble. They had to hire two people to cover my tasks after I left."
good,The people were great but the management sucked they treated us like work horses. They stopped giving pt. Overtime stopped matching are 401k just worked us to death
good,Set up the machine lines and pockets for each page of the magazine to run down the line to form a solid magazine. Make sure pockets were all filled at all times.
good,Hours are all over the place. You can go a week without having to go anything and the next week you could be working 70 hours. Pay is decent. On site Management is terrible but no problem with overall company management.
good,"Great pay, very dirty job unless your working in the office. They expect you to work a lot of overtime. So having a family is difficult to manage working there."
good,"they worked you like you have no life outside of work"
good,"It was a bad experience and I only recommend it only if you have nothing else, people leave all the time because poor benefits.  I worked here for 1.5 months and that was more than enough"
good,i like the company just not the people they have in charge and need better cleaning and lockers for workers and teach people how to work the machines and make things better with out getting paper cuts
good,Always needed to give 100% but would likely not be rewarded for your efforts to go above and beyond. Working 12 hours a day is tough on some people but the extra days off are nice
good,"Seemed a little chaotic and not a lot of team work going on. My boss was great !! But, my peers did not get along or agree and made the job much more difficult . Each one of them thought they knew everything and didn't take every ones thoughts into consideration."
good,Forced overtime is last minute most of the time. Scheduled overtime is pushed to its limits all the time. If you don't like all the it or are exhausted from working so much you can't get out of it. Shifts rotation is also a problem. You do not have an outside life.
good,"it was a great place to work, the continual changing of hands which intern brought less benefits each time is awful, no consideration for personal time meaning constant last minute schedule changes"
good,I enjoyed what I did while I was employed there. They provided opportunity for advancement. They provided a steady job for me and my family. Would of stayed longer if did not close.
good,Great place to work but it had to many hours a week to work plus some bad teams didn’t print good had great benefits plus if you had to mov they would help you move
good,"1. most enjoyable part of the job is break time. "
good,The men who trained me were very rude because I was the only female on the floor. They were condescending and did not want to train me much less work with me on the press.
good,"Productive ,work at a reasonable pace.Able to get questions answered  and worked through.Diversity and welling to learn and teach.Wish could help all the customers all the time. Some times just cannot. Enjoyable part of the job is working with people."
good,It used to be a great company to work for. Sadly Management went downhill over the years. Employees weren't treated fairly. Pay was fair. Working enviroment was ok. Some employees were treated differently than others. Jobs were few & far between. Long hours
good,Good job with lots of advancement opportunities through the years.  RRD split and I went with LSC.  LSC is now in process of being bought out by Quad.
good,"work always starts with the phone ringing and I learned to handle clients effectively, management trusted you to get on with your job and the culture was very much a can do attitude. most challenging part of job was keeping clients happy and exceeding their expectations"
good,"Not welcoming, staff in the company for a long time, not ready to welcome newcomers, management aggressive, seasonal job, need to work either overtime for a period of time and then nothing to do during shifts, having to pretend to do something."
good,A typical day at work is working with many clients at the same time to help deliver custom solutions accurately and in a timely fashion.  Always look forward to finding the most cost effective solution to meet needs of the client.  Smalls wins daily add up to great success over time
good,Swinging shifts of 10-12 hrs a day. limited job advancement due to lack of available advancement openings. Fast paced production schedule with employee shortage at times.
good,"Great opportunity to learn about different departments. The culture can be very stressful at times, but it helps build character. The people can be great to work with."
good,basic assembly work in a factory. was placed on different machines daily of weekly with various stations you and coworkers rotate around after breaks.
good,I was bindery helper and a city reader. We loaded paper in machines and made sure it went out to where it was suppose go. A lot of long hours. If I did have a son I go back but I had to have day shift
good,"Learned team building and leadership skills.  Daily contact with managers made it feel like they cared."
good,"The company has the potential to be a great one except, for the fact that in terms to become permanent, you really have to overwork your for just a decent salary."
good,RR Donnelly was respectful of the employees from Banta Catalog Group. We were able to still operate as we had in the past for the fist year after acquisition.
good,There have been a lot of changes to the company in the last couple of years leaving the future of some divisions in a fragile state.  Hopefully new opportunities will soon be introduced
good,"My direct managers are great people with a focus on my development and caring about my personal well being. Very understanding managers."
good,I enjoyed my job at RR Donnelly. I was able to advance in my position and strive for success. I was disappointed when I resigned due to job security in the future.
good,"Coordinated client projects from start to finish executing client expectations for creation and delivery of product. Learned diplomacy when dealing with client, required collaboration and time management  of  numerous internal and external departments to meet customer demands."
good,not the best place to work.it was a great starter job right out of high school. place is a dying industry so u wont be looking to retire here.pay is not the best for around here.
good,"People aren't so friendly to starters (new faces), complains about new people who just started and older people. Breaks are short and small area for everyone. No way to build yourself up."
good,I like what we at fist till they fired or our manager quit and everything change around from wearing uniform and paying they company when call off for sick or family probablys.
good,"worked there for 24 years. Seldom called off. Got a lot of computer experience. Familiar with all areas of the warehouse. Worked all shifts, mostly first."
good,"Traditional office environment. Small cubicles. Dress code strictly enforced. Work/life balance leaning heavily to the work side. Encouraged to work overtime. Prefer bringing on new hires on a contractual basis, not full time."
good,"Repetitive manual labor, do the same thing every day and don't get paid well. Friendly co-workers but all around just boring work including packing boxes, making boxes, moving palots, etc"
good,Clear job expectations and management. Always know where you stand. I liked working there. I left for career advancement.  Most people who work there stay so I was at the highest point I was going to go at the time.  I am always looking to better myself and thought that by going to this other job it would be a wonderful learning experience.
good,Working fir RR Donnelley was a very Interesting Some days were easy and some were hard and stressful. I loved this because you never knew what kind of day you were going to have
good,It wasnt hard work boring but not hard. I was putting inserts into books. Its a fairly simply job if you dont mind slow paced work but Im sure other areas there are more exciting.
good,"It was easy for the money .  Great coworkers, located right outside of town. The pay was good. The job is easy and a lot of breaks through out the night."
good,"As per most places, there is a lack of people who know the work, people who think they know, and few who want to know.  Lack of responsibility from most people."
good,"Great experience working there.Able to learn something new every day.manager very friendly. Working 3day per week 12 hours shift very Convenient"
good,The work place not to bad to work other then the pay and the benefits and not get enough hours to pay the bills and breaks are good and people are always nice to you
good,Buen ambiente de trabajo y buenas relaciones pero salarios bajos
good,Printing Industry Giant with steadily declining volumes. If looking for long term careers I would not recommend at this time. Local management at the facilities is very good.
good,Just an average warehouse that sells books. 15 min break twice a day and an unpaid lunch. The job was really easy and simple but the manager had a funny way of talking to people
good,"My 6 months  of working in office  department i have learned to work as a both individual and also as a team."
good,A great place to start a career in transportation.  Very relaxed environment and fun events to be shared among employees. You will do well if you follow instructions and have respect for the management team.
good,"Great company to work, good experience and challenging. only downside moved out of City of Chicago. excellent people to work with. excellent communication with all staff."
good,"I have not worked here in twenty-one years, therefore I am not able to give any kind of review for this application.  What I remember is hot, hard, dirty work with lots of twelve hour days."
good,"Work place where we can learn many things.Productive and fun at work place."
good,Not applicable as I have no comment good or bad concerning the company due to my non-compete clause signed to date. Again no comment and no review t make
good,"It was a great job. I would recommend to anyone ."
good,Was hired on from being a temp after 90 days and started getting benefits 60 after. Had a wonderful supervisor. Its like getting paid to work out. Not much flexibility for family life though.
good,Great place to work as a stepping stone to further pursue career. Departments try to work together to ensure smooth flow of work. Regular pressure is put on staff to focus on process improvements with allows for better business.
good,"Great company to work for,  if you've been there for a while already.  Coming into this company new and trying to establish yourself isn't easy at all.  Very hard to advance and move up in company because of the people that have been there for 20+ years."
good,"Project management in translation involves identifying requirements, organizing a project plan and managing a linguistic team, budget and tight deadlines."
good,Not a permanent job security. No breaks and only a 20 minute lunch. Very low communication skills between Donnely and employees and employment agency that sends employees to Donnely.
good,"Osage plant is overall not a bad place to work. New management is much better. The equipment is horribly outdated and maintained, yet they want you running wide open."
good,Alright job. Wouldn't stay here too long though. Work was fairly easy so it can get pretty boring.The management us cool but sometime they play favorites which can get annoying and also sometimes it seems like they don't know what they're doing. But I just keep to myself and do my work and get by fine.
good,It was a temp job with 12 hours work days with low compensation for the required work. The work environment is welcoming but it is a lot of work for the pay.
good,"every day was busy with clients coming on site sometimes up to 60 clients a day. Management tried to gave the Techs the right tools to get the job accomplished. the workplace culture was team work. the hardest part of the job was keeping the clients happy and to make sure the client had a great experience. working with positive people"
good,Come in  set up for the sorting of destinations of the mail and start staging pallets to load onto trucks later in the shift.. Almost at the end of shift start loading trucks as they arrived.
good,RR Donnelley was a decent place to work especially if you are on equipment then the pay was good for what you are doing. Besides that the other work they pay you for isnt enough.
good,armar libros simce para 8 basico paletizar revistas solo fue por un periodo contratista
good,"O ambiente maravilhoso para trabalhar, mas com desvio de função sobre selos do Imetro grande venda da gráfica."
good,I go in to work help get the press started up.  Which consists of webbing up the press chaniging printing plates. making sure the lines were started.  Making sure they have all the supplies needed for the shift.
good,Loved my customers. Everyone is super nice very professional work isn't crazy until its crazy ..lol . good crew to work with fun environment and really cool place to work
good,"After doing your homework, you will quickly determine the RR Donnelley of the past 150 years was split into 3 companies in October of 2016.  This presented an opportunity for me to pivot my career to focus on growth for me personally and professionally.  It provided a change in management, new challenges, fresh new business opportunities and a new team to lead, grow and learn from."
good,"Great place to work good vibe people are great wish I was there again "
good,but it was hard to manage life with such a low wage and less benefits provided by the company. salary scale is the biggest problem while with time we live expense only increase and the company reluctant to pay reasonable to the workers
good,"Job is not that bad, but benefits is severely lacking.  Pay is very good.  Coworkers are very friendly.  Very fast and quick turn around work environment."
good,"A competitive work environment within extremely competitive local and national markets. I learned management and utilization of multiple data bases for cost estimating and vendor sourcing for various production facilities nationwide.  The management and workplace culture was flexible yet consistent and very professional.  The workload was typically heavy with critical emphasis on time management, accuracy, quality of work, and the ability to provide cost and time-saving production options for sales and customer service."
good,It was good got to work at own pace and more u get out the more money you make.They worked around a family matter if it just so happen an the clocking in an out is s good thing when u got s badge.
good,"Job security is more than what you expect, poor management and Rrd is now performing worst. They are working to reduce cost at this moment which will not help in increasing the salary."
good,both the manufacturing side and maintenance departments are fast paced and pay well. lots of room for advancement if wanted. people are enjoyable to work with for the most part.
good,They sent my job to a different country and had us train them. I did get free collage classes and that was fun. I would never go back and work for that company
good,"Good workplace culture. But rotational shifts. Good work life balance."
good,"Good work life balance, good culture, progressive, good management teams, benefit programs could be more cost effective but it is a great place to work."
good,"The management team that was overseeing the benefits team was great, but was WFR this year.  Also, due to the relocation of the benefits team I am looking for a new job opportunity."
good,Culture of department seemed to change from encouraging to not very encouraging. Change of managers did not prove to be moral-boosting. Many good proofreaders found greener pasture. Volume decreased.
good,"Not a great company to work for.  After many years, some people in the management team put targets on your back and find ways to push you out the door.  Now they struggle to find employees."
good,"it's a good place to start in,i learned a lot in few months,but am willing to go into a new experience that is IT related because that's what my degree is for."
good,"RRD offers good experiences to grow & build  ground customer service skills, problem solving, analytical skills.  There's great opportunity to work with a variety of teams.  The days are rarely the same but still consist of repetitive work to maximize skills.  The main downfall is it doesn't offer competitive pay or benefits to make this a long term career & there is not as much room to grow as some places offer."
good,Job can be pretty monotonous but it is a job I enjoyed. Relaxed atmosphere while working continuously through shift. Management is considerate of opinions and input.
good,"As far as warehouse work goes, it is fairly good work.  Simple work but very long 12-hour days.  Sorting mail is not the most exciting thing to do, but for the kind of work that it is, it is a consistent living."
good,Nice company and can learn many things newly in that company and also good encouragement is there. I have learned many things newly in that company for past 6 years.
good,Good place to work.  Very safe environment.  Lots of good people in the building.  It is 12 hour shift work.  Hard on family life.  Pay in good for the area.
good,Empresa boa não tenho o reclamar fiquei pouco tempo nela
good,"Relaxed, friendly environment. Sometimes not as busy. Month-end closing is the busiest part of the month. Mostly accounting jobs and billing the customer."
good,Muchos beneficios experiencia aun más elevada un hambiente bonito
good,"At first, it was a family owned business, and they treated their employees well. As the years went by they began to abuse the employees.  Treated like a number."
good,"About Work environment :Its good"
good,"RRD is company which provides the best security to its employees and they always focus on the best working atmosphere with maxim enjoyment.As ours is a fortune 500 company, it always maintained the core values."
good,Classic example of a successful older company struggling to remain relevant and sustain itself in the a rapidly changing marketplace in which its traditional products and services are becoming obsolete.
good,"No Comments. Keep less expectations but you can explore more number of friends over there. It all depends upon your mindset."
good,needs to diversify. equipment needed to be updated. customer service needed technical training. more options at new job replacement would have helped.
good,I gained more knowledge and been encouraged by supervisors to work hard and smart to achieve higher level. I was been encouraged to get award and been very productive till I survived in my old company. The workplace culture was good enough.
good,Working in Power point and excel. i am achieved my target. i give 100% job quality to client. I am support to all colleague. i am satisfactions full job
good,I had an opportunity to work with fortune 100 clients and it was rewarding work experience which helped my career aspirations synergized with my skill sets.
good,Nice place to start out working if you don't have young kids. Not many benefit to part time employees. Laid back but productive and easy going. Nice staff!
good,It was good money at the time. Hard but easy to understand work. Shifts were okay. supervisors were fine. management was okay. The other workers were like a family especially if you had a new baby or got married etc. everyone pitched in to help.
good,it's a good place to work learned alot from co-workers just need to get past the union and get years of working there so you don't keep getting laid-off.
good,A typical day is running around with your head chopped off. Sometimes you got work that goes out the same day so you have to rush to get it out. I really dont learn anything but sometimes communcations if that place has it. The management sucks because most of them are their for a paycheck nothing else. Some of the management has favorites in that place. A lot of staff gets away with a lot of stuff. some employers gets fired for unnessary reasons or for no reason at all. i have more to say but right now is good enough.
good,"A respectful, comfortable atmosphere.   Challenging and at times stressful but always interesting.  The hardest part of the job was meeting clients' demands for increasingly faster turn-around times and lower costs."
good,Couldnt complain shift were different some 12 hour shifts some 8 hour shift everything was really up to your seniority. No paid lunch and the management on night shift was horrible and didnt know to value their workers.
good,Good place to work overall but management could care less about their employees and I didnt feel as appreciated as I shouldve been.  Very strict policies that I do not agree with but hey rules are rules I guess
good,RR Donnelley is a good employer.  They have provided me with opportunities that have enhanced my skills.  I truly appreciate these opportunities and enjoy being a mentor to employees.
good,"packaging books, gathering books, and stacking boxes is what my day consisted of. Wasn't too much to learn. Management was very nice. Good workplace culture. Hardest part of the job was that it was boring. Most enjoyable was that the people were good people."
good,Worked here 23 years left for 5 years and came back.  Stressful job as the printing industry is taking a hit.  I enjoy working with the people here as they are like family but not sure how much longer company will be around.
good,"i have been working with RRD for about 1 years now,The work/life balance and benefits are great.The only Issue i had was that, can't expect any personal development or growth opportunities."
good,Good company and platform to enrich our career  and enhance our skill set. Work balanced culture and innovative work place. Support from management at it best.
good,"Worked with great people but since the company split into three, it is very disorganized and everyone is frustrated.  I found management to be great in my department, but their hands were tied financially by corporate."
good,What I learned working at Donnellys is when your working as a team and doing you part things go so much smoother for everyone and to keep the product coming.
good,"My job was odd in that it was all off-site. Some of the RRD people were fantastic and really dynamic fun people. But the corporate structure was, well, very corporate. Still, the salary was quite good and we had a lot of autonomy while the job lasted."
good,"The company itself is ok, just the department I was in was not run in a professional manner.  Everyone comes and goes as they please."
good,The mission is to enable the future of innovative communications. RRD will continue to evolve by embracing the changes that are redefining the industry and continually seeking new and better approaches to manage the communication solutions that keep businesses and organizations running.
good,"can be stressful,but also easy days.its not a hard job at all. they are strict on attendance. half the time you wont have a life.you can be forced 12hrs."
good,"In a day, everybody needs to accomplish the assigned task with involvement."
good,"The company is one of the largest in Chennai. "
good,"Keep a fast pace, follow guidelines, get a regular check. The people were working for a check not for a future. There were many lines and many different sections to work on."
good,Over the past year I worked at RR Donnelly and my main duties included both mail sorting and data process. A different job from my previous experiences and I quickly established myself as an integral member of the group and acknowledged by my managers with hard work and leadership qualities.
good,"There is a constant and steady work flow"
good,Managers were given the flexibility in work timings in order have a good work life balance. Everyday is a learning experience in any organisation. Had great team of co-workers.
good,"Professional opportunity, with little guidance, feedback or training from my direct manager."
good,Decent place to work but I do not like the swing shifts nor do I like the fact that I was told that there would not be any lay offs yet here I am searching for a new position because I am laid off.
good,"Encourages working in a non micro managed, client facing environment taking ownership of relationships and technical delivery with key strategic clients."
good,"Putting heave paper rolls onto mechan and webing it up.And was a Material ,handler .placing bundles of paper on to palet.And using a hand palet jack to hall it a way."

good,"I am interest to work, because no any benefit from disabled this year. I need to work for earning more 39 credits until retire."
good,"The development department is a great team of people with plenty of experience. "
good,"Training is minimal, most of the knowledge is learned hands on. My co-workers are all very hard working individuals and very knowledgeable at what they do."
good,"This place is good for long term commitments."
good,"Too much overhead, since all the buyouts. Hard for company profits to hit plants. Hard to advance, explore new options."
good,"During my few years at RR donnely I have gain more experiences in all my current skills."
good,"For the most part, the people are good to work with. Lots of turnover of staff in the last year is concerning. Solid company overall however."
good,"An organization that handles a substantial amount of print volume. Has potential for greatness but limits success as their processes are manual and rudimentary at best. This fact unfortunately opens the door for inconsistencies within the customer service realm. Management is taking steps to remedy these issues, and moving in the right direction, unfortunately, that day is very far away."
good,"A productive well managed company on its own domain but it has a very less on sit opportunity for software testers."
good,Remarkable experience in documentation management. Developed amazing ability to troubleshoot technical issues in word and excel files.
good,"Good place to work as long your partner has good benefits and a good retirement plan.  Ok pay to begin, but don't look at receiving increase in pay unless you can get promoted."
good,"Good job and has employees in their Pontiac, Illinois plant that are great to work with. The printing industry is an interesting field."
good,This was a good company to work for but the work slowed down with the less production of books and printed materials. Lay offs came to often.
good,Jobs at RRD were very easy.  Management looks at every employee as a number regardless of their production rate or what is going on with them outside of work.
good,"They treat you like slaves, it's like working inside a jail. Benefits not so good. Hard to get your points low, but easy to gain them."
good,Typical day is managing Executives work load. Must be able to work independently as well as within a team. Huge opportunity to build personable relationships with colleagues.
good,typical day at work consisted of check production schedule to prepare for next jobs and getting supplies around for make ready. I learned a skilled trade while being employed at Donnelley and also a ton of leadership skills
good,"I learned to prioritize my work load.  Was often required to stop one order to help others in completion of a more urgent order or to complete a secondary order on my own.  Worked alone and with others to complete tasks. Learned to work complete orders despite various obstacles such as blocked isles.  Conditions were sometimes unpleasant (hot, dirty, smelly).  Loved the work itself, picking and organizing items on pallets."
good,I worked there 15 years. I was on time. Did a great job. Met with customers more than sales reps. Great relations with customers. Let go because of cut backs.
good,"Busy all the time"
good,"The organization is a good place to learn new things. Though growth is not fast paced, exposure to new concepts by co-workers who are interested in technology is varied."
good,Operating and maintaining a printing press for various customers!Working in printing is a very skilled trade and is not for everyone due to the demanding schedule!
good,If you don't like fast paced work this job is not for you. It is very rough on your hands after a while they begin to ach. They other workers were nice but everyone had their own little groups they stuck with. And the supervisors were always down your throat for not getting enough work out the door.
good,"It was a job not a career, alot of people at the company have been there for twenty plus years which is good, but that can foster complacency on the job, and an unwillingness to see change and growth from within because workers tend to feel that there is only one way to do a certain process when there are myriad of ways to get the job done and the books to the customer. The workforce is definitely going to change due to the fact that there are alot of old timers facing retirement, and processes will need to change to support a changing workforce. Management wants to be friends and not managers there is no clear distinction. Nothing is private, Watch your back if you work there.  Anything you say or do will be held against you."
good,RR Donnelley is a great  and well know company but to big. know matter how hard you work it can be hard to be recognized for the good work you put out / are doing.
good,its allways a very fast work place to work theres always work to do i loved showing people new things and diffrent ways and easier way of doing there job bt also making sure they r still doing there job correctly...
good,"This was a great learning experience,  I learn a great deal about financial print.  How to deal customer,  The people that were friendly and helpful"

good,"JCPenney itself is a great store with great sales, and great bargains.  However, at the time I started there wasn't a manger, and the 3 supervisors were stretched very thin playing their roles and the management roll as well. Shortly afterwards a new manager came from Indianapolis. He knew the JCPenney policies, but he was used to a very large store, and the Warsaw JCPenney was a very small store, so daily operations were quite different then what he was used to. I was there on "" Black Friday "" and had a great time working with everyone and interacting with all the customers, even the difficult customers weren't challenging to me. I had one gentleman at Christmas time who was looking for a specific necklace. We didn't have it in stock so I called all stores in a 200 mile radius looking for the necklace for this man. I finally found one and had it shipped directly to his home , no shipping fee. He was so thankful he returned to the store the following week, and brought me a thank you card! I was blown away!!"

good,"Everyday was a surprise. You had no choice but to do extra work(even if It was not part of your job) if you wanted to get things done and allow your day to move along smoothly. There was some really good workers there among the many that just used it for a paycheck. There was no hard work there just the lack of teamwork and laziness made easy tasks difficult. I personally enjoyed the daily challenges and extra work, due to the popular mentality of  friends and family first, work second. It tended to be infectious and things got out of control. The plant was closed and the fairy tale ended."

good,"First priority to quality"
good,"Over the years, acquisitions, mergers, and plant closures became a constant. This created a constant ""re-vamping"" of jobs, job descriptions, and duties. I went from customer service rep. to senior customer service rep. to production planning to senior accounting analyst, to material analyst, to senior customer service. The move from senior analyst to materials analyst was due to corporate changes, not plant need. Accounting personnel were moved to over departments, but kept most of the accounting duties plus additional one in the new department. Additional cuts by corporate resulted in my returning to senior customer service where I continued with some of my accounting duties as well."
good,"Great People, Good environment. Hard work- very complex systems."

I learned how to delegate and prioritize under extremely tight schedules that changed rapidly. My coworkers were all dependable and very talented and they routinely told me how much they respected my management style. I generally was hands-off, but always aware of every facet of the job and the team’s abilities. I was always able to step into every role in the production line and that was greatly appreciated by my staff. The hardest part of the job was managing that number of clients......all who needed to be treated individually yet we had to meet not only their standards but SEC mandated standards all under rigorous deadlines. The best part of the job was the appreciation and acknowledgment we routinely received from our clients for accomplishing what they knew was a tough job."

good,There have been a number of management missteps over the past few years. The stock price is now under one dollar per share. I'm not confident that this company would be a viable long-term fit for a young man job seeker.
good,"Team work among workers seems to come out so naturally with everybody being supportive of each other in tackling work. Hardest part of the job is having to work on growing number of accounts with ever decreasing number of staff due to the company's current policy not to hire or replace people who moved, retired, resigned or have been laid off."

good,"In the time i've worked at donnelley, i knew it wasn't some glorious free time job that i'd have leisure in. It was a factory and I did my job on the daily as needed to get through a night on my shift. I personally felt that it was a satisfactory job that tended to all of my financial needs without crossing any unnecessary lines. All in all it was a job and I had no real issues there."
good,"RR Donnelley is place of employee where you welcomed and treated equally! Very delicate job, relaxed environment, satisfying facility!! Each and everyday is what you make it !"

good,"Need to promote from within."
good,"RR Donnelley was a good place to start and grow. They do promote from within, both to a ""next level"" of the current position as well as new positions. The culture started to relax a bit after a few years, especially with the dress code allowing jeans.  Management is supportive and at least listens to employees. The people there are also great to work with. The benefits package wasn't great, high deductible healthcare plans and no 401K matching."
good,"My team was great to work with. I looked forward to work and collaborating with the rest of the team. My immediate manager was very approachable and knowledgeable."
good,"I enjoyed my work and had good solid employment for over thirty years. Unfortunately, offshoring and outsourcing led to the elimination of my position."
good,"my typical day at work consist of:"
good,"The coworkers are nice. However company is hard to catch  up with technique development. There is little growth opportunity. They have taken away anything perks that employees were given such as profit sharing, RRSP matching, Pension Plan, any and all employee functions. There is no Holiday party, no cards, bonus, nothing."
good,I started with an entry level position but did not take long to be promoted. The hardest part about the job probably would be adjusting to working 7 days a week. But you get used to it.
good,"The job itself was relaxing and easy, the people I worked with were nice and really easy to get along with.  I thought it was a bit boring some days when machines were down or if we did not have a work order ready, but otherwise the work was easy."
good,Unstable management with the hiring of a new president in early September. He is making too many changes without talking to the sales team. Many of the employees have a poor attitude about working and doing their jobs with enthusiasm.
good,"It is really nice for me to work on RR Donnelley Philippines, Its just that may kids are all grown ups and my salary in RR Donnelley is not enough for the needs and education of family."
good,"Hardest part of my job was doing a lot of work on my own when I had other team mates doing nothing or pretending they were busy while I was the one doing most of the work, but I took that as a challenge. Learning more from others however my peers hardly notice my hard work. So I didn't get any recognitions and others who did the least work did get recognition for an excellent job."
good,"RR Donnelley was a good company to work and learn from. I met many great Designers and Project Organizers. As time went by working for RRD, the raises and benefits went down. RRD outsourced it work force. It made it employees work with less,"
good,This company was unorganized and frustrating to work for. I was there 3 months and no one had time to properly train me. They were also understaffed and was a stressful environment.

good,"The company was average to work for.  Very old school management. No real room for advancement or increase in salary."

good,I was there for 23 years and had many opportunities for advancement and growth and I was treated fairly and honestly. I started off with only printing knowledge and learned the ins and outs of financial printing and management.
good,Great to work place for females and good management. Encouraged management to work in every peak time. but salary is very low.
good,"I have little to say of this company. The work and pay matched, but the work environment was not OSHA oriented. Barely any air was allowed in the plant around extremely hot machines. The uniform we were told to wear was not breathable."
good,"Great for stability, not for advancement. Low or no raises across the company. Not the place to work for if you are looking for advancement opportunities."
good,"Has laid multiple people off in our time here, including those in our area and seems to be very restrictive."
good,RR Donnelley is a place where you get to learn a lot about the print communications industry with IT Implementation in particular.
good,The work place was great. The work was typically the same everyday and you would almost work on auto-pilot. They did start to enforce a lot of overtime which brought the morale to an all time low and people were no longer happy working there.
good,"Lots of handwork and hours put in.  Working for RR Donnelley, I have learned how to prioritize and manage my time out of necessity. Many people who say they are stressed, should try working in the Printing Industry. "
good,"RR Donnelley is a comfortable and friendly workplace with lots of good collegues. It is like a family out there. Also, the managers are also co-operative"
good,I enjoyed this job because I loved driving forklifts and loading trucks. I really liked working the third shift because it was a lot quieter and less traffic in the workplace
good,"Manage daily distribution. Work with shipping, kitting and receiving to ensure product and staffing levels are being staged and used to meet deadlines"
good,"Very good environment, good colleagues.. Management should think about retaining the employees, only 8 hours shift per day.. and can have good fun at work as well"
good,Start day out making sure all materials are ready. Go over game crew plan with crew. Next go over productions schedule to make sure jobs can run in an effective way. It is always good to keep crew up dated and happy with what is going on. The hardest part of all this is keeping everything rolling for entire shift
good,"A lot of areas to work withing, various industries all under one RRD umbrella. Each division is like its own sperate company. Each office has its own culture the worst thing is Poor benefits. 401k matching gone! No bonuses whatsoever for quite a few years now! no raises in the past few years"
good,"The hardest part of my job is dealing with different personalities."
good,"The job can be fun at times,but its demanding.I like various types of equipment.Most co-workers are easy to get along with."

good,RR Donnelley offer a challenging yet satisfying enviroment.  The job roles are often varied within their own job description and you may find you are handling tasks that fall outside of your remit.  It's a fast paced environment and they expect a lot from their employees.  They are supportive employers and treated me very well while I was with them.  The rewards are equal to the challenge.
good,Learn how to communicate with external customers regarding shipments.
good,"Pretty decent Workplace, with team members who come together to get complete tasks for the day. Since I work in the technology business, I'm constantly learning new things everyday. "
good,"Workedfor company 22 years.Enjoyed what I did and liked the challeges.management was allright, however they brought in a folder operator supervisor to run the pressroom , if I had a problem he was no help. I have always thought my supervisor should know more than I.had good insurance which was excellent depending on what you wanted to spend. company had a big turnover rate and tended topromote people who weren't ready."
good,"Multiple years without raises, multiple changes of Plant Manager."
good,"I worked at two different plants over the course of about 5 years with this company. The difference between the two is night and day. Everything from the corporate culture, to the way staffing was handled was completely different. This made transferring from one plant to another quite confusing. The job was the classic mind-numbing repetition that comes with factory work, but my fellow employees were what made it a fun experience."
good,"Working hours 10am to 4pm."
good,Worked on assembly line to make books.
good,Enjoyable place to work with friendly co-workers and management.
good,the co-workers I had with me were the best people that I have meet. z
good,Did cleanup and bailing duties. Worked forklift and hand truck.
good,we were bought out by this company so I was only there for 8 months before they downsized the drivers.
good,Supervisor that took over shipping was a total jerk.He would hardly ever listen to anyone that was on third shift. He would only listen mainly people on day shift. Shipping was doing pretty good as of working together then he took over shipping and just screwed it up again. I worked there for 18 years. I’ve never wanted to throat punch someone so bad as I wanted to to him.
good,Really liked the Management and the team they are great to work with. The work is very interesting and challenging and the future looks very promising.
good,"Great people and good training but not enough pay and no chance for advancement. Approved to work from home due to commute time which was a plus, but low raises doesn't help with poor starting pay."
good,"I enjoyed this job. I was the only plant nurse for more than 500 individuals. I saw sick or injured employees, assisted them with. FMLA and Workers Comp claims. I was sorry when my position was eliminated in their downsizing efforts."
good,Fast paced with some heavy lifting. Many chances for advancement if you stay committed to your job. Good pay with good benefits. Diverse place to work.
good,"The personnel is incredible, travail agreable et propre.fast-paced environment,many great people! BBQs and prize incentives."
good,Understanding mangers that aid you in the skills you need to do the job as well as give you enough freedom to perform things at your creative ease. Overall a nice environment but not very competitive pay and no benfits

good,Working at RR Donnelley is great company if you like working in the commercial  printing industries. Great company. fast paced company. multiple departments for job opportunities
good,"Wasn't a bad place to work, but really fast-paced and hard if you don't want a physical job. Job security not a given because work is going more digital and over seas, but company is popular and produce a lot of work. Benefits are not as good as they used to be, but definitely good enough. The money is great for the work you do."
good,The only hard part about the job is loading up the rolls for the printer's...I then have to clean all  the printer's and do a print head test...if the print head test come back good...I could start printing...
good,"Dzień bez prespektyw."
good,"Benefits are poor, and you pay dearly for them, wages were frozen indefinately regardless of your work performance. Company no longer contributes to 401k, and stopped the win share."
good,I was working in a busy warehouse removing sacks of letters in cages by forklift. Loading them on to the Lorries and unloading empty sack and place them around machines. I was in charge of the gates and remove of wasted paper.
good,"Was a very good place to work over the years. Printing industry has changed. What was high price, great quality turned to low cost, low quality in a very competitive market. Price erosion, job loss to offshore."
good,Good folks great opportunities to grow.i loved it there made good friend .made a lot of money.the work is easy but just as easy to make mistake.have to be focus.can eat or drink at work stations can socialize anytime .must show up is the motto.
good,It was a nice place where there were a lot of caring coworkers. It was very hectic around tax season but that was what made it exciting. Management of ok but distant.
good,Fast paced and reliable hrs. Fun environment to work in as long as you're willing to learn the lingo of how to work as a team.  Wouldn't mind recommending others.
good,I am still working for RR Donnelley. It used to be a great company to work for until they stopped matching the 401K and stopped pension. The hardest part of the job is working 12 days in a row then only getting 2 days off. Only 4 days off a month is not enough of time off for family and friends. Benefits suck.
good,It is a good place to work. Put your effort to promote yourself to the next level. It is good that they provide dinner and breakfast at free of cost. All the team members are well cooperated. It is fun to work.
good,"RRD is an excellent company to work for however, my current location is having some slow times and a few layoffs and separations have happened."
good,"RR Donnelley empowers employees to learn. Especially, the company encourages employees to improve their soft skills, including communication skills."
good,"We had a very cohesive group at the FM, that new how to get the work done.  Client was very pleased with us, but after thirteen years, RadioShack went through Bankruptcy and couldn't afford our services.  RR Donnelley was a good fit, however corporate structure at home office took a remarkable disinterest in the FM in the last few years."
good,"Earlier day of the job are pleasant and good atmosphere.From that day I can learn much more about this work and I was happy with it.In case management ,it was excellent.but in case of co workers their behaviour towards me is not good."
good,"Work culture is admirable and colleagues were co-operative and makes me to work easily clearing all the doubts. There are so many facility like cab, dinner and beverages for break time. But there is no career growth in this company."

good,Lots to improve in terms of developing people. The management has to take more efforts in initiating new practices to improve the culture in the office.
good,"C'étais une entreprise très chaleureuse, l'aspect le plus difficile c'est qu'il manquait de supervision et d'écoute de la part des superviseurs il manquait de structure.."
good,"Monitored over 400 employees weekly time sheets; reported absences to managment."
good,Each day you come in and find out if any projects need to be worked on. You enlist more projects as you complete or have any on hold. From time to time there will be UAT testing and is mostly a group effort.
good,Joined in the start up stage and had good opportunity to implement my ideas. Worked with full freedom and fun.
good,I found in the 15 years of employment that there was no opportunity to advance in the office that I worked in.
good,"I truly enjoyed my time with this company. Unfortunately, I went through gall bladder removal surgery and was off work longer than anticipated. I was told I could return as supply increased, but my family needed to be cared for. I was forced to take the quickest offer."
good,The work life and personal balance was excellent and the people that I worked with made my job flow.

good,I liked working at RR Donnelley. The people were awesome. Training was clear and not rushed. I would’ve like to stay however they were not flexible with the schedule I wanted that is why I left. The pay is great.
good,Rr donnelley is better for freshers and candidatescan study lot of things in corporate culture with in their rrs experience. I thing Rr Donnelley is more supportive for Management.  Salarya nd Othera benefits are poor and only one good thing is we got salary in a correct date.
good,Great pay. I loved my job. The sales reps made more than we did but we did 80% of the work. We had to fund our own Christmas parties with bottle and can returns. Which is a joke. Sometimes I wouldn't get any training but was required to lie and tell others I knew what I was doing which I hated. Insurance was horrible but is offered.
good,"It was great working along side of the team in Billing but the work was heavy. It was fast paced but good. Kept people on their feet. I loved my boss she was amazing for many reasons. Mainly being a leader not a boss who just points. But i digress, job was well but if you are not up for fast pace and being in front of a computer all the time then this job isnt for you."
good,"Great place to work. Very fast paced and orderly. If you're not a quick learner, don't even try to work here. Pay is pretty decent but if you're like me paying child support, it's almost near impossible to live on your own in this town (Brenham)."
good,"Work 12 hour shifts"
good,I would work there again if i had the chance good money and made some good friends along the way.........................................................
good,good place to work. fair management. overtime was built into work schedule but it wasn't over bearing. easy to get time off if needed. didn't get a raise for  five years unless you call 1% a raise
good,Employees are treated like numbers as indicated by login name being your employee number. Bonuses are frequently lost due to no fault of the employees. Benefits are stripped away year by year. No 401K matching.
good,"Very fast paced, learned lots of things such as data entry, labeling and reaching the number goal for the company in production. Management is definitely great! that's about the best thing I can say about RR Donnelley they are always available when you need them and are very understanding. the workplace culture is also amazing there are Koreans, Latinos, Caucasians, and Indians."
good,"I loved the people I worked with in Digital. There is a lack of communication in the office which can make your job hard some times."
good,"I learned many things such as queries with clients, working in a big team, etc. The hardest part of the job is to work in fully night shift.Workplace culture is very good."
good,Rr Donnelly Was A Good Temporary Job It Wasn’t That Very Good For A Permanent Positionn.The Hours Were Various Because Of The Production Rate Changed Every Day
good,"Job was great until they hired a lot of people than eliminated their positions, great environment and workplace to be involved in. great teamwork with other co workers."
good,"If you want to excel in your career and have big aims not the right place, this is in the research and analytical team which i have been working not entire RRDonnelley"
good,Worked 16 to 20 hours overtime every two week period from 7am to about finish which was around 5:30pm everyday. Work was easy and people there are a little dramatic but other than that its like many other companies where you have to suck up to the bosses or be a really good and hard worker to even get noticed or be in the managers favorite circle.
good,"Although stressful to meet deadlines, I work well under pressure."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of 12 hours standing in one spot piling or feeding the assembly line.  I learned basic mantainance on assembly lines, and computer shipping and receiving.  The management was very strict, and didn't work well with personal matters.  My co-workers were very nice, hard working people.  The hardest part of the job was the long hours with no days off for weeks at a time.  The best part of the job was the breaks they offered every 2 hours."
good,The company before all the other companies that took over this  place was a family company called Bawden Printing. This business had expanded to grow with the needs of the new customers coming to use what we had to offer.
good,RD was an okay place to work.  As a shared services center it is much different than working at a corporate office.
good,"es un buen ambiente de trabajo, hay que tener gustio por aprender a operar maquinas, ser muy observador."
good,"Run various customer jobs on a 6 color printing press with another crew member. Pull alloted stock for jobs useing hand trucks or forklift. Preform routine maintenance and trouble shoot mechanical faults."
good,"i learned more about how mnc company will be."
good,A typical day at RR Donnelley starts with the interaction within workflow. Its a fun place to work and make valuable friends.Encouragement and freedom to take initiative at any point of time makes RR Donnelley the best place to work !! The hardest part of the job is rotational shifts and pressure but once u get used to it then there's nothing like it.
good,Learned to achieve targets as a group. Gained skills in data entry and came across good people. The work was very straightforward and simple.
good,"RR Donnelley was convenient for me at the moment of employment. I don’t have any negative feedbacks to express about RR Donnelley, I was grateful for the experience and I like that I got to new learn new things like how to operate a bindery."
good,i personally believe that the salary was bit low. working time was accurate and the HR department was supportive of all increments and icentive clarifications. The management was brilliant
good,There's a minimum of at least 50 hours a week but it's honestly closer to 60. Hard to differenciate between real life and work life because od so many work hours.
good,They provide a somewhat flexible work schedule.  I am able to go into work and tend to hardware issues while addressing software issues from a remote connection.
good,"Overall, the most enjoyable part was working with everyone. You get a variety of personalities that are friendly and never malicious. "
good,Descent place to work. Plenty to keep you busy regarding operations and logistics. Market analysis and sales are their strengths. Business to Business relationships are a plus for them as well.
good,I really liked working at RR DONNELLEY the only set back was the slow season cutting hrs and pay other than that it's a good place to work at. Fast pace work
good,very fast paced. I ran 3 departments load presses. unload trucks. put rolls of paper away. check ink drums replace when empty. The supervisor plays the blame game but has no proof. I always comment on a write up. the work hours are not so bad 12 hr shifts. its when they rotate every 3 months. my body can not take the abuse. The human body can not endure the punishment. I felt like I was a robot. almost had a breakdown los of appatite having trouble sleeping. your body starts to shut down. I took a week vacation. and was still called in to work. could not get rested. so I sold my vacation back to them and put in my notice. I also have a journal I made. as I  was working there. daily of the harassment I went threw from co-workers. and staff.
good,"I have been working here since 2012 and i am quiet happy with the atomsphere of the company. The company provided many thing that helpul for employees like free cabs, beverage coupons, free food on working holidays and sundays etc"
good,"Good place to work.  Had one bad manager. Enjoyed the job. Lots to learn. Presses were fun to work on. Kept you on your toes. Long runs , so once you got it all setup you would run for weeks or months on end."
good,A typical day was working on  an inline with a crew of 4 to 5 could workers. My least favorite was palatizing and my favorite was working on forms. I was correct crew on in line 18 and that was the fastest in line in the plant.
good,"Everyday would be very long hours of standing, stressing my feet and my back. Only time I was able to sit down would be break. Some co-workers were friendly while others not so much. Work place was very strict. First day of work, i was late by literally 1 minute and got point for that. Only reason why I was late was because I was trying to figure out the clock punch card and how to write down my daily card."
good,Fresher can easily learn about the MNC culture and self motivating.
good,"I will I of I have to but wouldn't like to a job is a job .no just playing love it hours are ok and pay is good based on your progress  like any job,I worked on third shift with the 12 hr shifs"
good,"Everything was good"
good,"very laid back work enironment. professional, and safe. always a chance for advancement. company pinics were always something to look forward to. just a great work place to work"
good,it will be so stress at peak timing . where employees are asked to extend for 10-12 hours as we will also get a extra benifits in salary ..it will be so critical in 4-5 Months other than peak timing it will be fun to work in RRD.
good,typical day at work would be going in around 7am and leaving around 3. I learned how to keep track of hundred of numbers and make sure they were in order quickly enough before we made too many bad books if someone fed the machine the wrong number. Hardest part about my job was the lifting of 40lbs THOUSANDS of times a shift. Most enjoyable was talking to all the people that worked for the company... I love people!
good,"Great place to work if you want to hate life. Work hours are long and boring, favorize is in every department. I have no more info to provide."
good,day to day is mostly the same thing very repetitive work management and co workers are easy to work with mostly very understanding in stressfull situations. the hardest part of my job is acheiveing very strict expectations of our costumers in testing work simply because we dont have very new equitment to run  there work on. i enjoy mostly my fellow co workers and working as a team.
good,"great teams, they have rotational job learning facilities"
good,"Una empresa con alto sentido de la ética, influyendo mucho en las relaciones laborales, creando un excelente ambiente de trabajo."
good,getting computer loaded for jobs coming making sure all product is on line ready to go i learned alot about leadership and taking complianment from my supervisor on job well done and working with with new people
good,Running robotics / trouble shooting issues
good,It was a good work place  they are very careing and they listen to you they take how you feel into consideration they are very good people to be around
good,"Good place to work, For short period of time. Good management. Very nice enviroment, good people to work with. RR Donnelly has a good location. RR Donnelly treats it workers very good."
good,"High Quality Training"
good,great people to work with trained to be cut fold operator didn't care to stand in one spot for 8 hours or working 12 hour shifts
good,The work required to do research on the system and finding defects/bugs and reporting it to the development team. A challenging working environment since the number of defects founds by each and every employee was reviewed every week and awards given for employees found more number of defects. Learned on system testing methodologies and to write complicated test cases. Management was really cooperative and listen to all the employees which is a really good thing. The hardest part of the job is having two managers at two different locations and adhering to both the managers and satisfying both was bit tough (Organization was having a strong matrix structure). The most enjoyable part is executing different test cases and finding defects in the system.
good,"RRD gives you the opportunity to grow. It doesn't matter if you start at the bottom. Working in team is what i liked the most, especially after long hours"
good,"Good working environment nice and calm, good job security excellent management and helpful trainers and nice clean working environment . With a job career opportunities"
good,"Secure"
good,"I was laid off during the slow season and found a new job. The job was fast moving and my coworkers were great, i loved working here honestly and would do so again."
good,"Sort mail to go into the correct trays"
good,A typical day at RR Donnelley & Sons Company would be a twelve hour shift of either filling packers with magazine paper stock or on the backend of the line where I would be piling off bundles of magazines on pallets.
good,Stocking the lines with unfinished materials and packaging materials and removing the finished product. Helping out with shipping and inventory.
good,"Set up variety of machines for operator making various magazines and coupons. Cleaned oIL spills at end of shift.  Maintained clean work area, removed selected machine parts at end of the day,  cleaning and putting them in proper storage."
good,"The team I was working with was great. I learn planning a load, rescheduling appts,"
good,There are frequent firings and there are rarely raises. Negotiate a good salary going in because you will probably have it for awhile. Also be prepared to be on-call always. And expect to get called.
good,I learned pretty much how to keep everything I do organized while picking with a forklift cherrypicker it was enjoyable but sometimes a headache with the all the things you’d be doing at once.
good,"Company interms of production is great, second to none.  Management leaves something to be desired, as blame is passed without any second thought."
good,"looking for a long term position, but they only needed part-time workers"
good,"Specific job, alot of  information and paper work but not  difficult. Working on mashin on post production. Many orders to remember and sort from printing until deliver dem."
good,The 38 years I was there I moved to various positions and it was a nice place to work.  After so many years advancement opportunities went down and eventually they closed the Gallatin TN division
good,"the hardest part of my job is the layoffs,and not getting forty plus hrs in a week"
good,"When I first started at RRD it was an employee driven company, since they became public the benefits, opportunities and advancements have been reduced."
good,"Working at RRD was a learning experience.  I was constantly reminded having the job was not my priviledge, but theirs.  I watched one of the biggest turnarounds I have ever seen for the position of 2nd pressman.  During my first year there felt threatened to hold my position constantly.  I only received a 1% raise the entire time I was there.  With the exception being when I was hired.  I was extremely underpaid and felt left out of the corp group of original employees.  I firmly believe I was seperated from the company because of my belief in speaking the truth about the job polcies and management."
good,"Getting readings off boilers and equipment 3 to 4 times per 12 hour shift"
good,Its not to bad of a place to work but you have to want to work long days and even weekends.
good,"I learned more about machine operations,Management was very helpful,i had great coworkers,the hardest part of employment is trying to find another job"
good,Well a typical day of work starts at 4am i learned to be a better peoples person the management was cool could have been better the work place was a very easy going place to be and the hardest thing is getting up at 3am
good,Swing shift is most def the hardest part about it but your body does get to use to after about a year
good,A typical day at RR.Donnelley is very slow pace for a packer the first hour of the shift until the operator starts up machine. My supervisor was so professional and fair. The most enjoyable part of my job was watching all those machine create the labels that's used to insert into boxes it was amazing to see everything come together with just ink and paper.
good,"Management really needs to step up, they have a good group of employees and they need to treat them better and compensate them better as well. Lots of employees are working hard and they go unappreciated."
good,"I wish I had landed long-term employment with the company. It was a temporary contract position, but I could see myself having worked there for years and progressed through the ranks to design and development."
good,"was able to interact with drivers and the work environment was a good place to work,,, everyone got along and were able to team to get the work accomplish. getting the product to its destination without a hassle and everyone wins"
good,"A day at work is boring you get to learn nothing new as your join in."
good,"Great people, not to hard work, horrible oversight and VP of ops. does not know what he is doing. As a package handler you are not treated like an important part of the team."
good,"A typical day at work includes mostly data entry, scanning, answering phone calls. I Learned our XPO systems for mailing services. We are growing with new management. Hardest part of the job is learning new XPO functions, there are many. I love my coworkers, it is an enjoyable environment in the office."
good,"I set up and run a collator. Its  machine that assembles multiple plies of paper from 50"" rolls that will fold, cut, glue, and print on this paper to create mail. When this product comes off the collator to be packed it is a finished product and ready to be mailed. I am responsible for my own quality procedures. Management here is the doing the best they can with what they have."
good,"I started as a material handler 20 years ago and worked my way up to an Assistant Machine Operator.  I enjoy my work with the company - my pay is great and my coworkers are team players. Unfortunately, my department is closing and I am no longer needed due to a lay off."
good,"Generally well run company.  Personnel could be better managed."
good,"12 hr shifts standing all day. I learned how to stack pallets, feed magazines so address can be printed on them, learned. Hardest part of the job was one week i can have as 60 hrs a week and then the following week i would only have as little as 12hrs. My co workers were very hard working on my line we helped each other out if the other fell behind. we joked around talked about our family's. anything to make 12 hrs move a little faster."
good,"Te company is having a calm, productive and employee friendly atmosphere.The management too is helpful and supportive in nature."
good,I loved the job - making sales calls - traveling - selling new services. The people were great - hardest part of the job was selling it internally.
good,Poor job security & work/life balance. Great co-workers and comradery.
good,Left due to the stress that was caused my new supervisor starting on my shift. Many people left due to poor management and structure of hour shift was ran.
good,Out of touch with what's really happening & what's needed.  They do not have enough quality employees.  Pay way too much for inferior people.  And when a quality person come there.  they underpay them.  Who then leave for better opportunities- else where.
good,"No preventative maintenance done on equipment.  No retirement offered. Equipment has not been updated in years. "
good,"When I worked there the place was low down dirty and paid even lower. "
good,"RRD/Banta has some amazing people and collaboration is very good.  The problem is that they don't pay enough for what they put you through.  The pressure can be intense.  I will say however, that I enjoyed the challenges mostly all the time with the job, but management could be very brutal and not very understanding of what they put you through to succeed.  I also don't think they recognize the quality of people that they have."
good,I would love to work here full time because it is team work that get the job done. The people i work with are very nice and will help anyone that is new there. The supervising staff and floor men are very helpful.
good,"Não tenho nada a reclamar da empresa, me acolheu super bem me ensinou bastante, fiz grandes amizades."
good,Very busy. Lack of spare parts. In experienced supervisors. It was a usual printing job. Lots of work and not much support from above. It was just a job.
good,"a balance between a laid back environment and steady labor. If you have ever went to a food store and picked up the sales paper of that respected store ; and said to yourself ; "" This sales paper needed to be printed better (or vice versa)"" this job is for you. we the workers here take pride in printing loads of sales papers until just the right amount of ink and color is at its equillibrium on the entire paper. The only problem that exists is within grown men trying to depend on anyone for a ride home they see with a car. Some people have a family and obligations that do not need to be further burdened with another grown man always asking for something like we don't get paid the same."
good,"I had a great time working for RR Donelley and, worked with and, for, some great people. I would work for them again if, given the opportunity. I left due to personal reasons and, the company was completely understanding of my situation."
good,Good work environment. Good people. Benefits are terrible but pay is competitive. Swing shift required. Some departments work a four star schedule
good,Can be laid back environment work isn't too hard some heavy lifting learned not to sweat the small stuff management is on a power trip but most ok coworkers for the most part are cool but some you have to watch out for hardest part is heat in summer most enjoyable is making friends.
good,didn't care about there employees everyone could be easily replaced treated you like garbage horrible insurance and their wasn't a open door policy which sucks
good,"i enjoyed the job at R R Donnelley.  though it is a BPO my job was something related to my degree, processing of financial statements.  the only drawback i found in this job is night shifts, and it was very difficult to balance our work and family.  otherwise it was a good work place."
good,"Maintenance of all Fire hydrant, hose reel, Extinguishers, smoke detector, beam detectors, Sprinkler systems, Machines, Plant, and Equipment"
good,"Worked in prepress and composition, opportunity to work with customers and employees for training in software. Enjoyed co-workers and knowledgeable employees."
good,"I get to work at my own time and at my own pace."
good,"I got much fulfillment from my work at RR Donnelley. I had never worked in the direct mail industry before, and I had to teach myself most of what I learned. There was some training, but everyone in the office was very busy, thus, I was pretty much on my own."
good,I was kept very busy but loved it and how fast my day went. I was responsible to supplying information and product to 300 sales reps.
good,"Every day goes like a second in my office, high pressure but, also I like that because each and every day I learn one technical things."
good,"Atuar durante 12 anos em uma organização é construir base, valor e relações duradouras e positivas."
good,"it was a good job to go to and the jobs were chalanging, we worked 12 hour shifts 3 days a week"
good,"when i come to work i look around to see what jobs are performed and need to to be shipped,start up my crew give them jobs and time limits,Check with shipping to see how much time we have before shipping hot jobs,assign all other jobs to be processed.Have learned to deal with peers being able to get more out of them then most without a lot of pressure..The hardest part was to have so many hot jobs to do with little or no help and time.The most enjoyable is to see my team do what were try to working and get out the door in a timely manner."
good,Maintained warehouse inventory of material near 100% accuracy
good,I did't have any issues with them the steel toe shoes were very uncomfortable
good,Maintained a good work life balance. Management was competent but little incentive was placed on promotion or continuous improvement.
good,The 12 hour shifts are that bad but the fact it can get close to 120 inside the shop and there is no working AC in the shops is a big health factor.
good,"RR Donnelley is overall a good company, my time and experience with this company was about average. Looking back I probably would not have gone into print sales, this industry has changed drastically over the years. Sales is a very difficult profession within the printing industry."
good,"It was a very face paced business that mainly printed phonebooks, which everyone knows those are almost never used anymore. some great people that worked there"
good,"High turnover of staff and permanent contracts are rare"
good,"Good Place to work, Great starter Job for experience in to the work field.Job Work/Life Balance"
good,Not a hard job but the pay sucks. I went through a temp company and the recruiter gets compensation but the pay sucked hit me. I live night schedule but the work wasn’t consistent
good,I worked 3rd shift which I think was a lot less stressful longer runs stuff like that. The people I worked with made the day and night difference they made it enjoyable and tolerable.
good,The work is very easy and it's a very stressfree environment.  The staff and employees are friendly. The pay isn't great for living expenses if you have rent and bills and kids... working nights takes away from your time with your family. But overall it's a great job. I would recommend this job to anyone that doesn't have a expensive living costs or kids. And if you get put on nights shift you will no longer have a social life at night. This job is basically for single people with no life and their bills aren't  too expensive.
good,"Working here was pretty decent, very laid back and chilled. i worked with a lot of people that was new everyday and they were very cool and helpful as well."
good,The job was easy but no training other than first day. Other employees didn't do their work properly but got away with it.no one would admit a mistake and fix it. A lot of negative vibes.pay wasn't enough to cover bills.
good,"Good pay, decent hours most of the year. Fast paced environment. Offers health insurance but at a very high cost to employees making it not affordable to most."
good,"Good people, but the company struggles with revenue after the split. Company is looking to define itself better as company as of late. "
good,"friendly environment, co-workers didn't mind helping if you fell behind with your work load. Learn a lot when the sears books was being made enjoyed the fast pace."
good,"the company does not appreicate their employees, the company keeps taking away and or reducing any benefits they do not contribute to any retirement or health insurance"
good,Good place to work for the shifts made it hard to juggle life outside of work with having small children. The management was good to work with and very understanding.
good,"Management is very strict at work place. Employees should be concentrated on work if job flow is there. Otherwise it will look like fun place. There will happen lot of  and we do enjoy everyday."
good,"Good work life balance, they care about employees in great deal except salary.  Good recognition to technical experts, gives free hand to employees on working"
good,Overall good company to work for.  The facility I work for is only 4  years old.  The one thing I would improve on is the culture. The culture still needs a lot of work.  This starts with the leaders.
good,I really enjoyed working for R R Donnelly. Some of the people were very friendly and I understood how to do the job. my training was very unpleasant and half done.
good,RR Donnelley can be a great place to work. Some locations do not live up to their potential and are not so easy to work at. With declining benefits and the rising cost of living salary is not commensurate for some positions.
good,"Typical day at work was easy to difficult depending on job schedule."
good,"Company full of politics, always encourages people from their state and mother tongue(Tamil)"
good,Assembled medical kits ranging from testing meters to packing boxes to be shipped.  Helped set up and teardown assembly lines.
good,"my job was never to hard, its had its moments when it was hard but other than that good place and good people to work with. the food is cheap and good. and another hard thing is i never saw my son working there."
good,"Fairly good company to work for, but unstable environment. Would like to see more on site training... it would really help with the lack of efficiency."
good,"I love being an accountant, with a variety of people to work with and a variety of job duties.  I have never been bored for there is always something to do and I can use all the skills and knowledge I have."
good,"1. The day we have qualified the pharma code reader"
good,"Fun, always wanting to help with training, very busy atmosphere."
good,This is an assembly line job so if you don't mind standing in one spot all day and putting things in a box it is the job for you. Weekly pay with direct deposit was very nice.
good,"Learned technical skills, soft skills. Learned the corporate culture and to tackle all kinds of obstacles that come along when errors strike at work. Hardest part of the job is during peak working with a very few seconds break. Had good cooperative and helpful co-workers, it was like back to college and school days with friends."
good,"I would b responsible for completing several different types of printed and bound books."
good,well rounded work experiences I personally liked the trouble shooting and fixing it. 99% of co-workers were great to work with.
good,Have worked nights 14 of the 17 years I have been here. Very little chance for advancement.
good,"I am currently working for a Global Document Solutions organisation. Working within asset management and managing the IT assets of these busy operation main duties includes; Software Licensing compliance, in addition to support works with USA teams. Including seeking business approvals and entering purchase details onto financial systems, order receipt, recording of new assets and perform a range of business administrative support tasks to ensure that the IT service teams comply with all requirements of configuration and asset management of IT Assets throughout their life cycle."
good,"I came in and picked up a customer job packet. I would generally review the customer's files to ensure that they were fit to print. Other duties included page editing, proofreading, scanning, assembling booklet proofs and finding ways to troubleshoot problem jobs. I became proficient in several software programs. The hardest part of the job was the tight deadlines, rotating shifts and mass amounts of overtime. The most enjoyable part of the job was my co-workers."
good,I've been there for 8 years. I enjoy my department although my opinion about how we do our job is never actually heard. Benefits are ok
good,Steel Toed Shoes.
good,meeting daily quotas
good,"After a years break, I had the opportunity to work with a great Business Director who was my mentor from day one. The office was shutting down and since most Project Managers had left the company, they hired me to take over their biggest client. I worked with multiple members of this clients, providing weekly updates and dashboard, PowerPoint presentations and worked on several small size projects."
good,"Typical day included calls to my clients in South America, visit from the clients to our publishing office, vendor relations and contract negotiations"
good,"like i said it was just the steel toe shoes, everything else was okay and the job was okay"
good,"The professional and friendly management, support staff, and hourly workers possessed a good safety culture. They worked with a good work ethic."
good,"Good Place to Work, onsite training classes, room for advancement"
good,This corporate company which had merged from a local business to a global entity within the time I worked there was a good place to work and expand experience in the graphic communication field. As with all companies there were highs and lows yet I do have fond memories of some good people there.
good,Every work day we came in and had a meeting telling us about what we were expecting. The work load was constant and the training was adequate. Ant questions that i had was answered by the experienced employees.
good,"The Customer Services Supervisor is responsible for overseeing all aspects of the"
good,"Rather you like working there or anywhere is a judgment call. Everyone experience is different! So, I would not let mine or someone else’s opinion affect my decision towards the organization."
good,aprendi muitas coisas lá um lugar muito bom de se trabalhar
good,There is too much inconsistency. Manager turnover and company ideals have changed and there is no straight focus on long term goals. The people are all nice and helpful but it is hard to get help from the top quickly.

good,It's a really easy job. Nothing difficult. People are also pretty good most of the time you'll work there. Hardest part is moving skids around and loading trucks.
good,RR Donnelley was a great place to work. Atmosphere is very work conducive and energetic. It's hard to figure out logistic of company and who is in charge of what account. Hard to get to know everyone. Big turnover in Management. Tight deadlines. Some over time. Understanding Bosses.
good,Three day work week 12 hour days a good environment to work in Hardest part of job seven day work week easiest seven days off during switch week would recommend working there.
good,"Good place to work, supervisor very knowledgeable, easy going, friendly co-workers. Managers shared an open door policy and were accessible to everyone."

good,"It's not a bad place to work, it's just stressful, mainly because my immediate supervisor is lazy and thinks he's too important to handle ""menial tasks"".  And when things go bad, he appoints a scape-goat.  He makes the job more difficult than it needs to be."
good,"This is not a bad company to work for if you're in relatively good shape.  The work itself is relatively easy, but the environment is what many struggle with.  It's loud (constant volume of a lawn mower), dirty and the presses and inlines generate a LOT of heat.  There is no air conditioning so temperatures regularly reach/exceed 100 degrees in the summer."
good,"Great working experience - great management."

I will never find another job with such great people.  When I was having a bad day, I would just go outside and my mood would immediately change.  There was a lot of stress but that comes with every job. There was also blackout months where vacation could not be taken.  I loved the feeling that I got once I stepped out of Penn Station into the city streets.  The feeling is unexplainable.  I left RR Donnelley to work at the Garden City Group."

good,There is no such thing as a typical day. The quality of your day depends on the press you are working on and how well it runs that day. It can be smooth sailing or it can make you want to jump inside the running machine. It's a very dirty place and it will change your routine after work.

good,Their core business is dying but they are aggressively diversifying. They have a balanced business portfolio. They prefer to promote from within. They have treated me fairly.

good,"At the time I worked at RR Donnelley the management attitudes were very dated.  They were very good about training people for new technologies to prepare them for changing trends, but the pay was consistently lower than market.

We had what I thought was a good, but challenging Management team.  My co-workers were outstanding.  The most enjoyable part of my stay with Donnelley was my team and I were never handed any fines dues to our 100% dedication to our job.  The hardest part was when we were all told that the company was moving in new direction and no longer would compete in the packing industry.  Donnelley if I'm not mistaken is still the Largest printing company in the USA."

I learned how the machines worked and how to properly assemble books and load them. Many of the employees were friendly and helpful. The hardest part of the job was correctly feeding the pages of the book to the machine that assembles it.

I worked with some of the best people I've ever met. In many ways it was even a fun place to be for twelve hours at a time. However, the work schedule was so demanding what with long shifts, lots of overtime and even working nights sometimes, it left too little time for family or fun."
good,Not a hard job by any means besides the rotating shift which isn't terrible. It pays better than most of the jobs in the area.

My co-workers were all fun to be around my first week there they made me feel like I already knew them, we all got along great and they all helped me learn easier ways of doing my job. The hardest part of the job is when I first started laying up I was trying to lift 4 1/2 -5 Foot bundles onto a table that was already 4 foot high. it was hard for me to reach that high with the J hook but I did it. The part of my job I enjoyed the most was when we hit our quota before we were suppose to, it made me feel like I was making a difference."

It can be challenging when I can't actually 'see' things happening, but that's what I rely on my counterparts for.  Their help with parts of each project.  Being highly organized and pro-active helps keep projects moving along smoothly.  And I have great relationships with all of the people I work with. I'm a huge advocate for teamwork and know that it takes a group of people to make things happen."
good,We had work most days it was a great experience.The quality team rocks.The inventory team was very helpful.Chris is a saint he really tries to work with you and help in any way that he can.Altogether it was great with the exception of the HR lady Mrs.Joy.
good,The job was a pretty good base loveed the environment lunches where not paid breaks were way to short mangers were really stric all Nd all job was financial worth it.
good,"The job itself is pretty easy ,the work environment even though fast-paced was nice supervisors and co-workers are always there to help.Only negative would be going without a day off weeks on end sometimes."
good,I enjoyed working at rr donnelley would still be there i messed up and got pointed out due to tardiness and absent i loved the people who worked there and miss them. The labor was not hard and the workshop is very clean. It is the cleanest workshop i have ever witnessed.
good,I loved working there until our company was bought out by RR Donnelley and eventually our office/plant was closed and all of our employees were let go.
good,Open door policy is practiced.  Toxic on peak seasons.  Less competitive salary and allowances compared to others.  Less productive trainings being offered.
good,"RR Donnelley Wetzel was the most amazing place to work. I loved being a supply chain coordinator 2. Had I not needed to come back to Iowa, I'd be a lifer at Wetzel. My manager was amazing."
good,Out going place to work.Fun atmosphere & easy going culture.Could use more work force but it gave us job security .Good place to git ur feet green & learn
good,"While I was there the people made my life better at all times!  The work environment is a bit dated.  The software is a bit dated.  The management needs more guidance (at that time).  However, the incredible people inside RRD, everyone from the production floor to the accounting departments were amazing and hardworking."
good,"Laid back, fun environment. Benefits and vacation pay if hired on.  Compensation not the best. Raises aren't given out often. Not much room for advancement."
good,"Freshers can have a Good Startup here, but know about the Team you enter as some teams are not worth for job change. Cant expect growth untill you reach 5 yrs. Management decision is final and no employee is encouraged for growth."
good,"The company no longer offers a pension plan but does offer a 401k. The pay is livable and the benefits are pretty good. The environment isn't bad either. Overall, a good place to work."
good,"The Pressroom work was challenging, and fun to do most of the time.  The culture shifted though, from when I started in 2000.  At that time the industry was strong, and shifting to a different format (size) of printed product, so there was new equipment going in and much opportunity for advancement and learning.  With the popularity of the internet, the demand for the printed catalog is at a point where customers are cutting costs to the bone in order to still print catalogs, which studies show are still viable.  But the cost cutting is then passed onto the printers and it became increasingly frustrating to try to run a press efficiently without parts and maintenance support.  I truly loved running a press, the troubleshooting was very satisfying, but I couldn't stand to beat my head against the wall any longer trying to do my job well, with the absolute minimum of support from management and low skill of the entry level folks who the company attracted at the wage they were willing to pay entry level.  Donnelley gave me so much over the years and I met many great people.  The heyday of (making money) in commercial printing is over though."
good,Great place to learn and easy to move up in the company. Lots of overtime available if wanted. Very diverse workplace. Grateful for the technical experience.
good,If the press is down for web breaks or mechanical problems your gonna have a long night. Great learning experiance just wasn't for me. The managers were pretty nice people they always asked how your were and if I was on break and not eating they would offer to buy me something.

Aprendí a programar en Inspire Designer. Una dirección alineada con toda la corporación, constantemente informaba a los empleados de los avances y proyectos, así como los errores y fracasos. Y de las acciones correctivas para mejorar. En general el trato con la gente es muy cordial y respetuosa, de hecho no se permiten los malos tratos ni el vocabulario grosero e irrespetuoso. Lo mas difícil fueron las largas jornadas de trabajo para poder cumplir con los tiempos de entrega. Lo que mas me gusto de la empresa fue que tenia fondo de ahorro."

You will have a bunch of different places that you are going to have to work. You will be taught a maybe three places. You will be trained in a week. You will be taught little and be expected to know much. A bunch of the stuff you do will be common sense. You will mess up, don't worry just ask some one to show you what to do. You probably wont like a few people there but most people are really nice. The job is going to seem fast pace, but you will find that all you really need to is work at your own pace.

good,"12 hour shifts"
good,A very good place to work but there are laid off every couple of years which is scary. laid back work environment and the manager is very easy to work with but not enough room for career advancement and benefit is not that good.
good,"No matter where you work in life, your experience is what you make it. The people you work with make work life either better or worse. The team here is definitely like a family. Some supervisors are better than others. Long days, long nights, all you get all depending on the clientele you have in house. You have  to really master your work life balance skills. Once you have invested yourself into this company and it's operation to deliver the best customer service possible, you feel rewarded by the raves of the customer's satisfaction. If you want to try something new, something that will have you on a roller coaster because some days are more fast paced than  others, try RRD."

good,"Working at Donnellys i had a nice time working there in a safe friendly zone environment. Although, there were some days better than others but never took long to get over the bad. They do provide you with plenty of work but if not then you can simply ask or ask a fellow co-worker if they would like to trade days or pick up a few more hrs by covering a shift on their day off. RR Donnelly is a good company to work for and would recommend to anybody."
good,It is really fun working RR Donnelley for such a long time. Its now time to move on for better opportunity.If I will be given chance to serve other company then I will be greatful
