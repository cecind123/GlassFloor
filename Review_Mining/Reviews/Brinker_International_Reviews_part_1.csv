bad,"If you like being ignored, disrespected, and yelled at then chill's is the place for you, I've never worked in a more disgusting restaurant to the point i tell everyone i know not to dine there"
bad,"Shown no respect by either other management or fellow employees. Never given any positive feedback, but if you did if wrong boy did you hear about it. Kitchen crew making decent money gets free food, servers making $2.13 an hour have to pay for food."
bad,"I don't like it because I haven't been sceheduled since January so a FULL MONTH, They also just hired another hostess in replace. I'm quitting soon. Everybody is annoyed with the costumers, They talk alot in the back about other people its just a bad place to work."
bad,This is my current employer and it is a a poor place to work. Promises from multiple managers of employment positions that were not met. Inappropriate and unprofessional employees/management makes it an uncomfortable work environment. I would not recommend anyone to give any of their time and life to this awful employer.
bad,"Two years into working for the company, my salary got cut by 50%. However, same amount of work and effort was expected by management. "
bad,"They work you to death then treat you bad  They use and abuse you they dont care about you as an employee only about putting money in there pocket.  The regional manager is a back stabber, lier who has no clue on running restaurants. Makes changes that dont need to be changed."
bad,"Es muy estresante trabajar ahí, no tienes libertad de nada y muy muy cansado sin recibir mucho dinero a cambio"
bad,"If you wanna work at a place that could absolutely care less about any of the staff then Chili's is the place for you. You're sick to bad better come in or you'll get fired. Family issues, again to bad better come in or you'll get fired. Have an issue at all they don't care, it'll always be your fault and you'll get in written up for even breathing the wrong way. The general manager is a joke. He will literally sit in the office and argue with his baby mama. Best of luck if you ever decide to apply/work there."
bad,To many chiefs not enough Indians.Rules and corperate regulations do not apply.My best advice is to not apply at Chili's because just when you think your an asset.Your more like a Liability.
bad,This Company is a hard company to work for honestly. More about making fast money than the guest or the people. I had a very hard Time making money with this company as a Server . They do not give you the support for the job they expect you to do.
bad,Working here is stressful and hellish. They will break you down as a person with no or little reward for accomplishment. Everything is a crazy rush that takes away all enjoyment of the work. They practice unsafe cleaning practices including pressuring shorter people to stand on or above hot fries and grill surfaces to remove and clean hood vents working here is a death trap
bad,"They never have enough of what a server needs to excel at their job. They schedule you a lot of doubles, never punish anyone for anything including drug use on the job."
bad,Yes upon my experience with working with chilies when I very first started working there as a utility person we were getting out at four and 5 o’clock in the morning in the dish pit within a weekI shorten that time down to 2 and three in the morning I was given a raise $15 an hour and then a new manager came in told me that I was making too much money and put me at $11 every since then I’ve noticed that you needed a dishwasher
bad,The hours are good if you dont have a life 3p to 3a 7 days a week. Sounds lovely but if your like me (student) then it wont.  The stories are true. Lol
bad,I would rather have my nuts cut off then have to work here again. Management is completely incapable of making a schedule. This place was terrible to have to go to and I dreaded every second in it. Work ANYWHERE else.
bad,"Chili's is too busy playing follow the leader and moves through the industry without any clear direction. They have recently jumped on the delivery service band wagon, which has created longer ticket times and exponentially more work without any added compensation for it's hourly employees."
bad,Chilis is not a good job if you are currently going to school they aren't flexible with work schedules. Everyday that I work they more drained I become.
bad,4yrs. Starting pay was 10.50. As of 2019 i barely made 11.25. I knew the kitchen like i know myself. Inconsiderate of great employees. Terrible Mngrs.
bad,"These f****** went in on my time and took over half of my hours away on my last check because I found another job. Do yourself a favor, don't apply here. And don't even get me started on how disgusting their kitchen is"
bad,"Horrible place to work , Highly do not recommend . Unprofessional environment/management , no tips, not enough hours . Cannot support yourself much less a family."
bad,"I worked at this company for a literal night before getting an abusive manager fired and quitting. My coworkers were all negative and angry and yelling at each other. The managers only marched around and yelled at us, calling us provocative names. My trainer kept leaving me and didn't ""train"" me at all."
bad,"This company will never appreciate any employee, no matter how hard you work for them. Managers will always push you and never back you up when problems do arise."
bad,I didn’t even get paid after my two weeks and was constantly calling trying to get my schedule. Very unorganized and not understanding. I have had better CNN placements in the job field but this was not one of them. Wasting money just to not get any in return is screwed up.
bad,I honestly think working here was worse than Starbucks and i thought Starbucks was bad. Managers at my Chiles only really cared about their job and not their employees. Had many complaints about food taking to long and my managers just allowed people who weren’t fit for the kitchen to work there.
bad,"Let me keep it simple"
bad,"Chilis relies on the Ziosk to terrorize it's servers in various ways; a super punitive environment that gave me ulcers. In addition, Chilis practices ""team service"", in which servers work as a team and then ""split"" their tips. WHAT A RIPOFF. Avoid Chilis at all costs."
bad,Doing way to much of what is expected of you. Poor management revenue very low schedules not followed through when hired management attitudes and the way they things is deloprable needs better understanding
bad,Don’t work for qdi upper management that descent work in the restaurant is horrible to working managers and staff and make terrible decisions on general management
bad,Very rude coworkers and managers. Not ran efficiently. Hard to get a managers attention when a customer brought a problem to my attention. Very strict.
bad,Horrible management. The only raises I got was in work loads. The district managers are just as bad as the general managers. Horrible place to work overall from top to bottom
bad,"Very slow during the day. Very short hours. Not enough hours given during the week. Never get tipped out when bussing tables. Hate bussing tables, especially during a busy night."
bad,Chili’s is reducing wages for cooks  to minimum wage and they are making servers tip out more to cover the cooks wages and that’s unfair for servers and the cooks
bad,The work is terrible the people that eat there tip horribly and the general manager at the parker location is extremely unprofessional. Overall the lowest of serving jobs I’ve ever had. Only good thing is the cooks will make you food whenever you want if they like you.
bad,"Horribly ran restaurant, constant turn over in staff due to poor management. Employees stealing food, other servers tips, AND ALCOHOL FROM THE BAR CONSTANTLY!!!"
bad,"Chili's Puerto Rico no sirve, son totalmente injustos con el empleado, forma de reclutamiento poco profesional, estándares incómodos en relación jefe-empleado, no cumplen con la ley del mínimo federal ajustando nómina al personal de piso en los restaurantes"
bad,"Don't work for Chili's, you get treated like your nothing, even when you bust your butt for them for over a decade. Good coworkers sometimes, but that's the only plus honestly. They work you like a dog and no matter how good you are they still treat you horrible"
bad,New management team came in and the quality of service decreasesed immensely. Micromanaging culture. Most work under 30 hours a week so they do not have to pay full time benefits.  The have a no fire policy.
bad,"Managers all quit for better things than brought new one in and she fired everyone and brought her own people would never assist in any busy hour rush, she also would stand there and tell you what to do even on a rush when its their job to cover in holes in the system i always had people calling in on the weekends i would be only server there.. Worst place to work in Espanola NM."
bad,Chillis at Parkside mall is bad. The managers don't know what they are doing they show favoritism and it just wasn't a good work place. People there were also rude.
bad,"If you want to work for a corporate company that pays no mind to the health and care of their employees, then this is the place for you. Turnover rates are ridiculously high due to how stressful shifts are on a daily basis. I have worked for this place (multiple locations) for years and it only gets worse as Chili's goes on a downhill spiral. Servers are over-worked, underpaid. Hosts are made to fend for themselves. Cooks are over-worked to their breaking points. Numbers, scores, and labor ratios are the only concerns."
bad,"sucked at caring about their empolyees and didnt want to take the initiative to help better the environment in anyway.  Also didnt care to pay equally or tip out hosts when they were doing the most work, bussing sitting people folding silverware everything to keep the flow of the restaurant going."
bad,Managers are horrible.. They favor the bad workers and want the good workers to do everything.. Horrible horrible job..  Unless u like kissing but....
bad,"Worked for them in college when I was broke. You get out what you put in, to a point. Has all the verious benefits and miseries of quick service restaurant work."
bad,"Servers make sure that customers of a restaurant enjoy their dining experience and have duties such as taking orders, serving food, cleaning and resetting tables, replenishing supplies, refilling glasses and solving customer complaints."
bad,"If you want to be treated as less than human jump on this train of garbage. "
bad,Managers and staff would brown nose the district manager. Managers would brown nose each other and finish each other's sentences also. Their skills are very lacking in everything and pretend to know everything there is about everything.
bad,Management is poor talked down to employees talk Smart to employees overwork the stash no teamwork and then talk bad about the staff to the staff in front of the staff And once complained about the situation nothing was done about it
bad,Worst job I've ever had lots of racism and favoritism core staff is hard to deal with this job is for the birds. Work 6 months hated every day. Hated.
bad,Working at chillis was awful full of favoritism poor Management staff and lazy people they do not give raises they are selfish and worry about only numbers
bad,"managers have favorites, treat people unfair. will cut hours for no reason and give away shifts. tips are good if few people working. good food though"
bad,Dont waste your time here they suck and they over work there worker that why I quit and never look back also they dont give out brake you have to ask for a brake when it not busy but it always busy had me doing 3 screen while only one person on fry
bad,Not great. Worked hard everyday and got fired for unknown reason. Coworkers would be hateful and rude when asked a question and management is terrible. They dont care about your wellbeing as long as your at work
bad,"The worst management I've ever had or seen. They only provided me with 7 hours of work for 2 weeks, that was broken up into 2 shifts, they are ungrateful and rude to their customers and employs."
bad,Revolving management. Theft. conflict of intrest. bad days. horrible food. no new menu options. im only writng this because i cant skip it so there its a disgusting job
bad,"SPOILER ALERT!  (yes pun IS intended for this food establishment) "
bad,You can have something going on with your personal life and it maybe shown management won't ask you what's going on management somewhat didn't seem like they maybe concerned coworkers are fake and two faced a lot of drama coworkers some had difficulty knowing how to talk to people
bad,"Save your time and don’t work here. Decent tips, but horrible management. Always understaffed, and a horrible training program. Management is super unorganized. Lots of sweat for little pay. They don’t care about their employees. Plays favorites"
bad,"This is the worst job I've ever had. The bosses were terrible and selfish. The coworkers were mean and lazy. The restaurant was dirty. They got mad at me when I couldn't work around Thanksgiving, even though I was literally going to be out of the state. This is the worst job I've ever had."
bad,Everyone was miserable jerks. The hours were terrible. The building and some workers were dirty and very questionable. The ice machine had mold in it & hasn't been addressed. People could get sick.
bad,terrible place to work at. They treat you like you're nothing. Mess work place. no respect for one another. The only good thing was that they never really changed my schedule around too much.
bad,"Collapsed at work Manager on call was an illegal who refused to fill out incident report, Got fired for going to hospital so illegal wont be deported."
bad,"Horrible place to work. Nobody cares, employees constantly on their phones. Management was mostly useless depending on who was working. Menu is designed for people with low incomes and those people do not tip well."
bad,Chili’s was defenetly the hardest job that I Had and it was a challege. That I did like. It’s just poor management. And lack of communication. I was the man there. But all depended on me when they didn’t depend on other cooks. They relied on me to much. It got old.
bad,Management was terrible! A cool came around the line in a disagreement and went to swing on me and management did nothing  to help . When I reported it I just seemed to have a target on my back
bad,"Started working for this company from day one... Gave it time since itsl was a new restaurant. Now 3 years later, the general manager is lazy and comfortable and only cares for BOH. Rest of management could care less. The one manager that actually runs a good shift isnt there as much as what the restaurant needs. The staff are young and lazy and only care what they are dling after work and snapchatting and just hanging out...with ome of the managers nonetheless. Theres usually the bartender running aroind doing everything and one server trying there best.A restaurant needs more than 2 people that actually want to work."
bad,"Crítico, desde la contratación hasta el último día de trabajo todo ha Sido muy por debajo de lo esperado.Se aprovechan de la necesidad de la gente.Le roban al empleado reduciendo  sus jornadas laborales sin que el lo sepa."
bad,I loved working at Chili's until I transferred to the Fort Collins Location. The management here accepted my transfer and promised full time. I received barely 20 hours a week with the worst tipping shifts. I could Work 4 hours and walk out with 20 dollars. The staff working here are pretentious and inconsiderate. Not a single person introduced themselves to me during the time I worked there. It was the worst work experience of my life.
bad,"Absolutely terrible, the other cooks were doing meth in the walk in and freezer. Never eat or work at the alamogordo chili's "
bad,"Newest GM, the third in 2 years, cut everybody's hours, no matter how good you are, only the youngest servers or tattooed girls get 4, 5, or 6 shifts a week, the rest of you, two, if lucky, regardless of your good reviews or customer feedback or work ethic, you are chopped liver.  Move on."
bad,Most management doesn’t care about employee happiness or problems within the work place. Upper management (district manager/supervisor) are only concerned with appearing positively to corporate offices and not actually worried about their restaurants running smoothly.
bad,"Working at chili's, for me, was a learning experience. I learned what it was like to work in a hostile work environment, how to maintain proper composure when things are hectic, and how to move at a fast pace while getting everything done correctly."
bad,Working for a corporate restaurant is aqful. There is absolutely no loyalty. The corporate performance expectations are impossible to meet. I do not recommend working for this company.
bad,"Would never recommend anyone to work here.  The guests are too demanding for the type of restaurant this is. It's sit down fast food, not 5-star dining."
bad,This job has favoritism the manager is not fair at all if you are a butt kisser than by all means go for it the manager is a pure butt hole. This company is the worst job i had it is a poor work enviroment and has poor management skills and has no open door policy they feel the manager is always right when they aren't.
bad,"I wouldn't know how to describe it basically unless you are part of the ""crew"" yiull be learning all by yourself. Poor training and very long hours at times"
bad,"Management is so unorganized there’s no communication and they just hire anyone I feel like they really don’t care about anything"
bad,I would never want to work for this company again. They ask too much for too little in return. They are more concerned with their online fake reputation than the welfare of their actual loyal employees.
bad,Las propinas te las dan cuando se les antoja no te las dan como deven de ser y te las dan por partes
bad,Chili’s expects a lot from its hourly paid employees with limited benefits. Company that does not care about its workers. Management gets better benefits.
bad,"The edison location has no proper managment, no team work and they take advantage of people by over working them. Also, if you ask for a day off or something for personal reasons, they made a big deal about it and would make you feel so guilty for even taking a day of for some personal reason. Overall this place is a terrible place to work at and would not recommend anyone to work at the Edison location."
bad,Everyday had to come in to an understaffed kitchen and work 3 positions for an insulting rate of pay with absolutely no compensation i was making and saving them money while they ran me ragged and treated me like dirt no stars
bad,"No benefits, paid time off, they play favoritism, no room for growth. Don't ask for more hours or a raise. They'll fire before you get either. They didn't even train me my first 3 days. Just threw me at a register.  The General Manager is always on vacation, but when employees ask for days off they will take them completely off schedule. They need a new management!"
bad,"We had management turnover every 2-3 months which made it very difficult to feel like a team before the managers were switched out. One manager would promise something and then the new management team would come in and not keep the promises. The managers were overall rude to the team members and treated them like they were worthless. After years of working for this company, I had to move on."
bad,Terrible management. Favoritism and friends of management are most likely to keep their jobs over a hard worker that isn't close to a manager outside of work.
bad,Working in a restaurant setting is very hard.  Chili's was great when I worked there just hard to work in that environment when you have a family.  Great job for a college student.
bad,Terrible management tries to run kitchen with fewest people possibly and provides no help when things become overwhelming. Dm never comes to restaurant yet negatively affects conditions there with poor decisions.
bad,worst job ive ever had. nothing else really to say. if you want to start being a server its an okay place to start but would never be there longer than i needed to be
bad,"The Chili’s I worked at was a great place to work until I had an issue with how many hours I was getting. I was traveling 30 mins to only work 3-5 hours for 2-3"
bad,"Managers will take advantage of your hard work. No positive feedback, you only hear the bad news. Constantly having to do others work, most people there are not team players. The managers will make your business everyone’s business as well."
bad,"Would never recommend any cook here, they value servers too highly because of the fast pace casual dining they offer! That’s why they’re aren’t many of these types of restaurants left besides big chains."
bad,you dont get raises... its hard to cross train. Its hard to transfer to other locations. Alot of sloppy work always having to clean up after co workers.
bad,"DO NOT WORK here. Brinker International is a low down dorty company that will suck you off if and when they find the opportunity. Do yourself a favor and stay far away from this ""situation"""
bad,I worked for Chili's for three years. I worked 40 hours a week at first. They always give all of the hours to their new employees despite your performance. I was at 10 hours by the end of my employment and was forced to find another job despite begging for hours. I always went home defeated and worn out. This company is NOT worth your stress. Every one of my coworkers would pass each other and say how much they hated the place.
bad,"This job is super stressful and the managers do not care about your well being. For training its the bare minimum they just throw you out there and you have to learn for yourself. Managers are very rude and immature, it really isn't worth it when you barely get paid that much."
bad,"Employees did not care about customer experience and were always caught up in their own worlds. Managers were not good and I don't think they could manage a kindergarten class let alone a restaurant. Since I left a lot of people have as well, what the managers need to do is to focus on teamwork and not be afraid to be strict, but also doing so in a respectful way. Everyone there has the potential to do good, but within my year or so there it was not good. Overall communication was terrible between the host, servers, cooks, dishwasher, managers, literally, everyone was terrible and it all comes back to the managers, I really do hope that one day they'll be able to figure it out and pull it all together."
bad,"Management at Chili’s is literally ran by 20/30 year olds that were not trained properly and do not have the experience to manage a restaurant. As a server, we are frequently running out of things like napkins, ribs, silverware, and basic things I need to do my job. The kitchen at this particular location gets to do whatever they please and they don’t care how fast the food goes out even though my wage depends on it. "
bad,Would not recommend. I left because I didn't get paid for my first month and a half of working there. Still waiting and fighting for my money. Also they screwed up my W-2 and still fighting with that as well.
bad,I have to say that this place was the worst. Everything from management to how they treated their employees was the worst. It was akin to being a slave.
bad,"I learned to serve here and I really loved that part of my job...but the whole environment was terrible. The people were largely unwilling to work together which is essential for running a successful restaurant. I loved my managers but sometimes I felt they had no business running a restaurant. We constantly had demands coming down from corporate which resulted in the servers getting in trouble for things that weren't our fault and constantly under threat of being fired. Yet, we were so understaffed they begged people who quit to stay."
bad,It is insane to me that they didn't hire bussers and hostesses have to do everything for $8 an hour?? People are rude and staff is unwelcoming and rude to other staff members
bad,Chilis continues going down hill every time they change management. I was personally threatened by a previous manager because I decided to leave the hostile environment.
bad,"I was in school and sports at the time but while I worked there the staff was great, mangers stay on top of everything. Everyone worked in a fast past but stay organized."
bad,The managers at this job play favorites and they promise things they never come through with. The managers were very rude to me and treated me badly daily.
bad,"They don’t know how to schedule, they don’t value your time. They have favorites, and their side work is ridiculous for 2.13 an hour. Feels like they exploit their servers"
bad,“Brand standards” are ridiculous. Everything is based on a paper that you are rated by tables on the ziosk at the table. Not everyone wants to pay out on those and it’s very biased. Side work is ridiculous and the managers don’t care about anything but your numbers.
bad,Manger is not properly trained to carry out duties and fails as a manager.  not flexible AT ALL and fails to work with the employees.  No growth opportunity.
bad,"Directed customers to their seats. Delivered general information, cross-trained. Handled take out orders and helped prep plates. Includes minor maintenance of facility."
bad,horrible managers and co workers. I did not enjoy going to work. I literally dread working there. Other people in the same position as me were paid more than me also
bad,Worked at Chilis at Edm International airport. Management has no people skills and those responsible for training don’t train properly or leave you alone to fend for yourself. When being trained to do certain things you find out after that management doesn’t want that and fires you. Would not recommend working there at all!!!
bad,"Not only was management incredibly difficult to work with due to a lack of respect, the job itself was full of obstacles such as being given impossible work hours and not following requested availability ."
bad,"Did most of the prep work by myself"
bad,"If you like fast pace and high strung environments look no further then chili's. Where the management doesn't care about employee health or customer satisfaction. I worked at a chili's for over a year and in that time, I've never hated being in the restaurant business more. Between the constant bullying that was allowed by management from the veteran employees to the new associates, to having sick employees constantly in the building (which mind you goes against health code). The hiring process is as laughable as the ""care and consideration"" that management has for their staff. I've worked with felons before but none as violent as these for example constant yelling and punching equipment. The constant putting down instead of building up of new staff really put the restaurant in a state of decline. But that's okay because they steal from the restaurant and are high while they do it. They over work and under pay a lot of key staff members, while turning a blind eye from those who are literally stealing from them behind their backs. My advice the money may be good but the stress ain't worth it."
bad,"Very stressful, understaffed, expected not to have a life outside of work, would send rude text messages when not on the clock about the shift placing blame on other ppl instead of what we need to do differently. This company sold a dream that they could not live up to."
bad,"Poor management, unhealthy work environment. Weekends filled with yelling and screaming employees. Cooks with no training. Food that is embarrassing to serve. Filthy bathrooms."
bad,I would work everyday from 4-11 and I would get paid 3.25 per hours plus tips but I wasn't getting the right amount of tips. So I had to quit. I would do server jobs and still get paid 3.35.
bad,rude staff hard to work with management. iffy hours not great pay tips were taxed and kitchen staff was rude and would spit in customers food. not kept as clean as i would have liked to see
bad,"I worked as a hostess (I was a minor at the time) and I bussed tables that the servers were supposed to take care of (they refused to take care of the tables because they didn’t want to be seated), refilled drinks for servers, and still took care of the front lobby. Managers often would stand around talking in the back just watching or being completely ignorant. Especially if I was alone. Weekends are supposed to require two hosts. Often I was by myself for this."
bad,"Not the best place to work. Felt  i got ripped off in tips by manger always, and every week it seemed like there was a new manger. No one ever stayed around long. I was there for 3 years!"
bad,It pays the bills if you're lucky and management likes you enough to give you decent shifts. Like most other jobs you are just a dime a dozen to them.
bad,"Personally I love working and bettering myself and others. This establishment I worked at 2 different locations and every time I was given unfair hours, insuffient job training, no breaks, and cussed out by fellow employees, managers and even the general manager in front of customers. Chili’s really needs to reevaluate their turn over rate and how they allow their workers to be treated."
bad,"Management cussed at employees, allows cooks to speak to servers however they please, and they’re just overall disrespectful. The restaurant has no structure at all and they don’t care to work with your hours. The schedule is always copied and pasted so if you requested off a month in advance, expect to be scheduled. Poor place to work."
bad,"Management was very cut-throat and mean at times. I do not remember one shift where someone wasn't yelling at someone or someone leaving their shift in tears. Cliental was also awful. In my 6 years of retail, I was yelled at more in my few months at Chili's by customers and managers and other servers more so than I have ever been compared to my other 6 years of experience. I do not recommend working for this company by any means unless you have very thick skin or plan to be the boss yourself."
bad,"I liked the staff at the store, but not long after starting a bartender was let go. there was a bug problem at the store and they expect the staff to help prep for exterminators to come in without paying more."
bad,This was the worse job I’ve ever had. The managers always wanted you to meet these unrealistic goals. The co-workers were all about helping themselves. There was absolutely no teamwork or organization. We were always busy on the weekends but the only way to make enough money was to work 12 hour shifts with no break.
bad,"i did not want to further my career at chilis. i didn't see room for growth. i didn't enjoy working here. the environment, restaurant values, management choices."
bad,"Greenville location - Low pay, very poor management, cut throat, low hours.  Don't waste your time applying.  They constantly change your schedule, no opportunity for advancement and they always keep you under 30 hours so you don't qualify for benefits."
bad,"Not a good place to work. short to no breaks, short staffed rude manager but he's fired now still wouldn't work there. too much favoritism.  not enough hours or pay"
bad,"They over work their employees, deny everyone time with their families as well as proper breaks. The GM is extremely unprofessional and biased. Verbally abusive"
bad,Cooking cleaning . taking out trash.. Preping. Cooking. Washing dishes. Cuting foods. Taking orders.sanitation. making sure everything is neet and placed
bad,"Here in Lancaster is the hardest Chili's to work at. The clientele is kinda rough and fights do break out when they don't get their way. There are walk-outs daily and these environment can be very demanding for a 3 course meal for $10. "
bad,Chili's treats it's crew like dogs not like they should be treated. no matter how hard you work they find a flaw in everything! They make all faults seem like the crew when in fact most of it is lack of knowledge on the management team
bad,"so unorganized, management sucks, I dreaded coming to work but it was fun finessing the system and having cooks make your food. Those are the only perks"
bad,"my time at chillis was horrible sometimes you worked not enough hrs too to many.every other day there was a new policy,more etc but no raises.it was a job."
bad,"chilis is a quick way to make money, however it is not a good place of work, its way too stressful and the management team doesn't care about you all they care about are their numbers"
bad,When you needed help you wouldn’t get it. Only when it was okay. New GM was unprofessional and sent me home and took all my shifts away without telling me. Told me he would call me to let me know what happens. Never called. Coworker had to tell me that he let me go and said he wasn’t gonna bother to call me he was just gonna leave it how it is.
bad,"At 18 years old, they would have me come in at 8 in the morning, and I would work there until about midnight possibly later. I was the only host, and I never got any tips even though I would bus tables, take drink orders and run food. I will never work there again."
bad,This was a mess. Great example of promoting from with in gone wrong. These big chains think that numbers and data apply to a good dining experience. Out of touch.
bad,You have no future at a place like that. I worked hard everytime I clocked in and was loved by my coworkers. Yet it was never good enough for my new manager.  There was no reason to be that way.
bad,"No communication among staff"
bad,Horrible place to work employees and management are messy and start nothing but drama.  Do not expect to advance or receive a raise because management already has favorites from the regional manager all the way down to the restaurant manager. I'd be jobless and homeless before I would ever step foot to work in a chili's again.
bad,"Chilis is not a good place to work. Maybe it was just my experience, but the staff and management were atrocious. Had to get out while I could. NO thank you."
bad,"Do not waste your time with this place! It's not even a good place to work temporarily part-time. You'll spend more in gas to get there most days, than you'll make!"
bad,"I gained a lot of back of house experience within the restaurant industry, but that is all I can say about that. The leadership lacked consistency and quality, The fellow crew members did not care about anything especially the customers"
bad,"Needs to replace some of the management.  Would never work for them again. Horrible all the way around, only good thing was the money. Dont get a job here if you want the stability of providing for your family. No job stability and Tons of favoritism. Absolutely no balance between home life and work."
bad,"The only great things about this job was that the menu is easy to learn, and the company is national so you can transfer... IF you get along with your GM. The customers pay on a Ziosk, but what they don't know is that your schedule is based on those Ziosk surveys. Members of management are petty and give awards to those they like and cut unfairly. It was the worst."
bad,it was a great place to work the building caught fire and they couldn't place me anywhere. i loved the employees and the management everyone was awesome and very friendly.
bad,Horrible place to work management did not care about their employees just themselves.  Choctaw indian owned and they stick to their own kind of you are an outsider or not a CDIB holder you have no future with them
bad,The way they determine who gets the shifts they get is ridiculous and over rated because not every person who walks into a restaurant does a review and they almost trap you into conversations with people they don’t really want to have either because they came to eat not chit chat with their server.
bad,the company does not care about the work life balance like they claim too and they only work to cover their butts when they have messed up. a manager is no long allowed to manager they end up mainly working hourly functions due to lower staffing in an effort to make the company more money. This runs the guest away.
bad,"Horrible, disorganized, free for all work environment."
bad,This was the worst job I've ever had. This place was ran as smoothly as it could be but thats because they drain all the blood sweat and tears out of your body in order to keep the floors clean
bad,"My manager acted like a teenager,  Always throwing fits in the middle of the dinning room in front of customers.  Ended up leaving the job because she flipped out in front of co workers and guest over something she didn't like."
bad,"The whole restaurant needs to be restaffed. Management is terrible due to poor leadership from the GM Colleen. This restaurant needs SERIOUS help and FAST. Lots of stealing, employees getting high on shift, drinking the restaurants booze on shift and even seen managers getting high out back!"
bad,It had a bad work environment even worse management and low pay never apply for chilis it really sucks working late nights and then you come home and your feet wet stay far away from chilis!!!
bad,"The hours were really long, you work a lot of holiday and weekends. Quality of life is not good. "
bad,The restaurant is disgusting itself. The managers do not care about you or anyone else but themselves. They schedule unfairly. They have zero respect for their employees. The rotation of servers in this place was ridiculous people were constantly quitting left and right. One of the managers was very inappropriate. They pick favorites! I worked there for almost 2 years and never once didn’t I enjoy working there. The money is decent.
bad,Chilis was a mistake. I really like one of the managers she was really trying to better the place unfortunately when she went on maternity leave the other managers just didnt care about what she was trying to accomplish making it a terrible place to work.
bad,"When I worked for Chilis, we were constantly training new employees that often would not last longer than a month. Additionally, the management would often pick favorites to give the best shifts to."
bad,Discovered how much I loved cooking when I was a chef. This place ruined that for me and made me hate working in a kitchen with food. I grew to hate the atmosphere around cooking because of how terrible this place was. I know not all of them will be like this but it was such a bad experience I don't ever want to risk being in a situation like that again.
bad,This is a terrible place to work the managers dont care about the life you have outside of chilis they stole our hours and never paid us for it. The managers suck and just lie. Not to mention the roaches crawling everywhere including on the food ice cream and in the soup.
bad,they like to hire and fire so if you just want a quick serving job for 3 to 4 months this is the perfect place for you and has terrible managers although I think the worst one left.
bad,"Not a good place to work, I wouldnt recommend working here. All of the servers are grumpy and fake. Take your experience to a more qualified restaurant."
bad,"At time the atmosphere between the kitchen and servers is borderline hostile. Also if you habe bad surveys you are punished by management removing you as server completely. This also includes bad surveys due to problems in the kitchen or personal issues with a guest, and even issues when management does not seem to have the time to talk to a guest who is upset."
bad,"Took me forever to move up in the company, hard work may go unnoticed. The work staff however is amazing, I've made a lot of life long friends working for this company."
bad,terrible place to work  ...........poor management..............would not recommend working there.hours were short ...bad environment...pay was not right
bad,"Chili’s is a business that does not value their servers. I cannot speak for the other positions since I am primarily a server. I have worked for the company for 3 years and honestly hated it but the tips were good. My management as of now are inconsiderate, inconsistent and disrespectful. The management always has an excuse for why they can’t fix things that need to be addressed. The people I work with are awesome I’ve met some super cool people but management is garbage."
bad,if you like getting either alot of hours or no hours this place for you. management was terrible. my life revolved around the business. did not get raises every couple of months.
bad,Management is poor and unfair. A typical day will leave you with stress and unwanted tension. The management turns their back to all the bad going on including the guest. The front of house staff is the last priority in all situations.
bad,very disorganized servers stressed out cooks the Gm was always a good guy a typical day there was always like living a nightmare. felt like i have done too much for too little.
bad,"Job was too stressful. The company was constantly changing things and adding more and more aspects that made the job more stressful or check averages even worse. For example, the three for ten deal (app, entrée and dessert for $10). While great for the customer, made check averages awful and put the kitchen under too much stress. Those who were hired after me, were promoted first and those who asked for raises were practically ignored and never given an answer. Managers can be incompetent and money was so not worth it."
bad,I worked there for two months and the manager suck it was very unsafe in the kitchen and there was times I seen food drop on the floor and still be served to the customers I would stay away from this place it not ran right managers only care for themselves and there is to many safety regulations being broke
bad,"Worked here as a temporary job. typical day would be go in, clock in, check in with the boss, then the rest of the day wash the dishes after every customer was finished."
bad,My review of Chili’s that I worked to would be a great place to work if they get rid of the managers and treat all employees equal! I would to be apart of that team again only if there is new management.
bad,The managers don't care about your well-being. My coworkers argued with me on many occasions on situations I didn't have control over. I was even assaulted by 3 of my coworkers. I was overworked illegally at the age of 16. I was paid $3.19 plus tips and was disgusted with the working conditions.
bad,"I was there from the opening. tons of work and hours at first but as business slowed i lost hours. was told i needed to learn other ""stations"" in order to keep hours but the business is so disorganized that was a fallacy. only select employees are held accountable for their jobs while the rest of the staff spends their working hours ""slacking"" off. Not a very team oriented environment at all. Horrible training and unknowledgeable management"
bad,Horrid place to work I wouldn't advice anyone to work here. Very high stressful situation most of the time. Hard to care when management doesn't care.
bad,"Poor management, terrible culture. Lack of caring, no one is held accountable, never saw the GM as he only worked mornings, was paid 2.13 an hour to scrub walls and do extra cleaning if the restaurant was slow."
bad,I didnt really like it. It was a part time job for extra money. I mean its chilis you get paid for the type of work you. I also worked all positions in the restaurant
bad,If you don't want to be able to spend time with your family this is the place for you. The day after I got out of the hospital they made me work 13:24 hour shift.
bad,a typical work day consists of having to constantly find a manager to fix something and listen to the staff yell and scream at eachother while guests complain
bad,"The managers didn’t care about the employee "
bad,"Overly stressful environment with rude coworkers who were totally careless, rotating schedules where hours were never guaranteed and terrible management! DO NOT apply there if you want an enjoyable job!"
bad,"Management is clueless, Very clicky, if they like you, you can call out as much as you want. If they don't like you they will do you dirty and try to find a bogus reason to fire you. Every employee that comes in gets worked to the bone until youre completely burnt out then the get rid of you. Management has no control over anything, especially the kitchen."
bad,this brand in general sucks.  does nothing but cater to the cheapest of cheap clientele.  Management for the most part just seems to be skating by without ever really having to do anything.
bad,"This is not the place to work if you are looking for a career in cooking. Ive been here 10 years, started out at 9 dollars an hour and now only at 11 dollars an hour. You will not get paid time off or vacations, the medical plans are not good, and you will end up working your butt off and get no gratitude or appreciation for it."
bad,"I was honestly so disappointed with this company. I enjoyed it so much, greeting people was great. I liked making people smile and feel welcomed. I was also great at my job. But I can't work for a company who doesn't take my school schedule into account and penalize me because they think I can somehow be in two places at once. I was also promised to work one day a week when I brought this up but was schedule an entire week, by myself no less. When I wait, I emailed the GM a very nice message and he didn't even get back to me. I was offended and appalled by their lack of communication about that issue. They have too many favorites and some of those employees should've been fired by not following company guidelines."
bad,"If your going in to prep just know that you will be required to not only complete you prep list, you must cook on the line when necessary and well as clean all of the lunch rushes dishes. They don't schedule a dishwasher during the weekday. Be prepared to be frustrated and under appreciated."
bad,"I worked at chilis and it was not so much the guest that bothered me as it was the management. I would have stayed at chilis if there was not such a notice favoritism between the male servers vs the female.Managers who did not like servers would place servers in sections where you will not make any money, which is unfair since to chilis is a place money can be made."
bad,"Chili is a good TEMPORARY place to work, i worked there for 4 years it was my first job out of high school, the manager ended up taking advantage of us younger workers and started stealing our tips"
bad,Chili's was the worst company i have ever worked for. Its the dirtiest kitchen ever. They passed health inspection by 1 pts twice. The place is over ridden with bugs. The kitchen equipment always breaks and managers dont care about the quality of life for their employees.
bad,I didn't like the job at the end. It's very stressful and shows you almost no life skills. It's a good job not a good career. Good people do work at the location I'm at though really hard working people.
bad,"said I would get 40 hours a week and only got 25. Generally in- organized and other employs were disrespectful and treated you like wrongly, would not recommend"
bad,"I did not like working for this company. I asked for a few days off to go on vacation (I have never asked off before this incident) and when I came back, they would only schedule me one day a week and then would release me after 2-3 hours of being there. It was very frustrating but since I had a second job, it was easier for me to leave due to the poor management."
bad,"The GM fires people to instill fear in those who still work there. The restaurant is poorly maintained. Server performance is rated by the customers on an electronic tablet, but no feedback is offered to explain how to increase your scores. It is a horrible place to work."
bad,New management is rude and takes enjoyment from belittling employees. it was hard to get anywhere and I really did not enjoy it. I worked for the company for years and saw it go downhill.
bad,"Chili's in Glastonbury, CT is by far the worst restaurant to work for. The general manager is an absolute tyrant who makes it miserable to work there. He favors certain employees and makes the schedule difficult. They will change the schedule last minute on you, giving no notice and find ways to get you to quit so they don't have to fire you. The service manager fat shames employees and only allows ""attractive"" women to become bartenders. The cooking staff is a disaster and the food hardly ever comes out on time. It's incredibly stressful, guests always complain, and the entire store has gone completely downhill, hence why you always see an ad on here for servers. People are constantly quitting and they barely manage to keep enough managers. Go to any other Chili's. This one is awful mainly due to the general and service managers, Paul and Pamela."
bad,"Management was unwilling to accommodate hours for highly rated employees due to personal grudges. When they are not feeding off gossip from their employees, they are creating their own in order to divide their workers, causing them to choose sides."
bad,Though our regional director was a delight to work with. Chili's over all work environment is very poor this includes level of team work and management.
bad,"It is one of those places that sounds like it would be a great place to work. however, once your there you see how one sided it is and cut throat if you want to survive you have to be willing to basically have others fired. I do not recommend this place."
bad,Most enjoyable part of this job was walking out or all the free food that we get from the cooks that was only benefit I eat all the time for free.  The managers are just some random people who  got a manager job they are lazy
bad,"when i first started at chilis i loved it we had a great hard working crew, over time being in a training store we went through a lot of managers and they werent very helpful"
bad,"They do not care about your well being, just the money made from customers. Your personal needs are not respected, the restaurant comes first always ."
bad,Management does not act like management. Unfair hours and unfair shifts. Culture of the work place is fast and steady. Most enjoyable part the employees
bad,"Extremely unprofessional. The systems were not in place. The operations ran from the hip on a daily basis. The menu had some good point, but executing was really hard."
bad,the auburn ma location is terrible. Management team is a disgrace. The general manager is hands down the worst manager I've ever worked for in my life
bad,"They say things trickle down from the top and that is never more amendment than my experience at Chili's. In an effort to report higher profits every year the company took the easy road instead of the competitive one. The company placed a cap on cooks pay and froze raises from 2010 forward so we higher paid cooks received no raises while the new hires who where being hired at minimum wage did. So they where complacent but as cost of living continued to rise we felt the difficulties. It would take new hires over 5 years to make what we where making but by 2010 I had been there 6 years already. In 2011 the company took away the Vacation Pay and benefits changed to offer a unsupported health Plan due to Obamacare. In 2012 the company eliminated a cook position from every Kitchen and made 3 cooks do the job of 4 cooks. The company began precooking and staging foods in order to save time and effort for the reduced kitchen staff. There was never even a pat on the back for a hard days work. All of the praise and incentives went to the wait staff and the kitchen staff always felt neglected. The icing on the cake was the intentional cutting of hours for the highest paid cooks to save the company more money by allowing the inexperienced cooks to run the show. This resulted in poor Customer satisfaction scores and a bad reputation for this restaurant. The restaurant had to Re-locate to the highway off ramp to be competitive and has been reduced from Chili's, #1 in casual dining! To Chili's you know it's bad but it's Highway food like Crackerbarrel. This was a wise decision so they won't"
bad,"too many hours a day to work with no down time"
bad,If you're looking to waste your time then this is the job for you. This is a black hole to a world of  H E  double hockey sticks. You make fast money but you sell your soul to the chili pepper devil man of evilness and despair who will stop at nothing to take fun from your joyful life you have before you came into the establishment.
bad,"I loved working at Chili's for the pass 7 years, but the pay has not improved, along with the workplace. The overall feel of the work is nice, but the pay overrides that immensely."
bad,"The worst job you could work at, management makes everyone quit to were we are always under staffed. Managers don't care and if you try to complain to coorperate the next day your fired or your schedule looks real bad."
bad,"Chili's in petal would be a great place to work for, if management actually did their job. There's no structure, there's no consistency, no one cares."
bad,management sucks!!      my gm left food over night in the kitchen sink and when I spoke to her I was fired. she didn't do her job and never helped when asked to do anything.
bad,"Company does not care about employees, , no bus boys, no overtime pay, no janitors so you're basically spending 2-3 hours of sidework a night doing what could easily be done by the help of a bus boy or janitor. Customers are rude and insulting. Chilis will out right fire you for getting ""bad"" customer reviews even if it's for something that is not your fault (I.E.: bathroom was filthy during a Saturday night rush). No training for hostesses, they do not seat in rotation, they seat all 10 tables at once. Cooks do not wash their hands. Managers are highly stressed because upper corporate puts unrealistic expectations on them which in turn makes the staff miserable because our management is miserable. I forgot to mention absolutely NO breaks, and if you ask you will be laughed at. I wouldn't recommend this establishment to my worst enemy."
bad,You will work endless hours and leave work at really late hours of the night and still be expected to open the next morning. Customers are rude and do not tip well no matter who the server is. Management is horrible!!!!!!! Schedules will go up at midnight and you will be expected to show up for work on time the next day not even knowing you were supposed to work because the schedule is up so late. Managers play favoritism. Employees have bad attitudes and come to work already in a bad mood. Chefs are VERY touchy and make girl servers very uncomfortable. Managers do not care at all and do not say anything to them about it. Would never recommend working here to anyone!!!!
bad,"They being Quality dining Inc, a company that franchised Chili's.  They did not care about the servers. They did not care about the cooks. They did not care about the low level managers. They fired the best, hardest working, most caring manager because they thought he was too close to the rest of the employees. They moved in all new managers and purged the servers of anyone they thought to be too close to each other."
bad,"Started off great, but they refuse to fix issues in a timely manner. We were without a/c for a month, and still hasn't been fixed. It also took over a year to fix the parking lot with massive cracks and potholes in it. The only reason I had stayed was for fellow employees."
bad,"The chilis in Woodbridge has roaches. one manager was amazing, the rest were rude and would yell at their employees in front of customers. The back was dirty and the cooks do not wash their hands."
bad,The values of this company are completely skewed. Management is unprofessional and lazy. All workers are taken for granted and have been told that they are replaceable if not willing to put up with certain things.
bad,"Worst place to work, constantly changing management "
bad,I always enjoy any job I apply for and a regular day at work would be a steady but busy day interacting with customers and resolving any issues or answer any questions and making sure I do my job 100%
bad,You can try to call me when you're ready.. I have to be a great man.. I'm going through the glass on the train station.. you can make that work for you
bad,I stood at a podium for about 9 hours with no break. Management was bad. Hardest  part of my day was being on my feet with no break. Most enjoy able was the day ending.
bad,work hard to serve people and make a good living in the restaurant business. I learn to work hard at work youth want out of like. Hardest part of the job was to work a whole full day.
bad,The company lures you in with Great Benefits like specialty days at Kings Island for Managers. But doesn't deliver when it comes to balancing every day life
bad,"We were told, as servers, that if our pay wasn't enough that they would pay us the difference. Servers do the most in our work place and we get paid nothing. We have to pay for our food, we don't get the 30 minute break, and people in the back of house don't have to pay for their meal and they get 30 minute breaks. Management continues to gloss over us because it seems like they don't care. It was not an enjoyable place to work."
bad,"This company is a faced paced company an ok job if you like working in the food industry. Although the management at this company needs a lot of improvement. I left this t"
bad,Bad experience. Management needs changing. Culture was poor and most people working there didn't want to serve the customers as best as possible. Work place was dirty.
bad,"Managers were very unprofessional, other servers were very unpleasant, hours were horrible, no breaks, managers were never helpful, and the guests only come for the deals which means not much in tips"
bad,There is to much work to do with little pay. seems that the manergers didnt care for their staff and was not willing to work with them when they needed
bad,Management does not work with you as far as scheduling or helping you succeed. Co workers are very chatty about people that they do not like. Management doesn't not hold every employee to the same standard set by the company.
bad,This place has management that does not care about it's team members.  The cooking and cleaning is second rate while the employee benefits are barely worth the trouble of a shift
bad,"I hated the greasy floors, the butt kissing and the manager who fired me for pointing out that she was wrong with a certain issue.  I no longer cared at that point."
bad,"I didn't like working at Chili's at all, is was fast peace, always short staff, and people never last to long on full times positions, no good benefits."
bad,"Unprofessional enviorment. "
bad,Not a good place to work at all they care nothing about their employees . Servers eating off the customer plate. Servers stealing from each other. Management talking about their employees to other employees. Management cursing and calling his employees bad names behind their back
bad,having to tell each guest 3 things about the ziosk was stupid and no once cared. just let me take them to their table and leave. managers were TERRIBLE and would literally cuss at their employees. pretty sure they all sold drugs on the side.
bad,They will have you doing everything under the sun and pay you nothing for it.Management is nonexistent and the drama that floats around this place is pitiful.
bad,"a chain restaurant in a city generally attracts tourists that can't find anywhere else to eat.  the chilis in center city was precisely that- long hours, no breaks and no support from management."
bad,Do not ask these questions anymore when people are looking for jobs it is not wise and very time consuming to do when trying to look for a job thank you
bad,They have nobody's best interest at heart. I take days for everyone there and i called in one day and they take all my days away leaving me with one day a week.
bad,"working at chili's is very hostile. while working there the management was very poor, verbally abusive, and in approachable. The management continually left issues unresolved and did not ever put effort into fixing the problems of the store but rather harassing the staff."
bad,"Management is awful!!!! They don't care about the employees. Just the guests. Which I know they are the most important, but not taking care of your employees means they will stop caring or leave."
bad,Terrible amounts of favortism and hostility from management. Constant threats of termination in a group setting. The culture is not conducive to a healthy work environment.
bad,Wonderful money and made great friends. The management team was not wonderful. The company did not care about employees.
bad,"My serving experience at Chili's was fine, but there is huge focus on ITR. That is fine until you fall behind and your schedule is based off of it. It was hard for me to come back from it and even harder to pick up shifts once my schedule was cut. My location, in particular, was not respectful of my schooling and let me go because of it."
bad,"Chillis has no team work, rascist and theives. They do not protect their employees in fact they lie in order to cover themselves. Managers are sneaky and not management material especially the former manager."
bad,General Manager is an awful person.Constantly yelling at someone or cursing them out. very hostile work environment and overall just not a good place to work
bad,Working at this location was great before the management changed. The new staff are rude and unfriendly. They don't care about the way in which they treat their workers. They are only concerned with overworking their employers. There aren't any breaks neither is the place kept clean. They have rodents all throughout the kitchen and the workers hardly ever wash their hands.
bad,management sucks really bad they train you for a week and then expect you to know everything management talks down to you i quit two weeks later......
bad,"Journey, the general manager is the most unprofessional boss I have EVER worked for!! He talks down to everyone, and expect's you to perform like you have been working there for many years! Chili's turnover rate is astronomical! When a sports team does below average, the manager is fired! Get the hint!!"
bad,.My co-worker was awesome. I made so many lifetime friends here. This job help me to come out my shell. I will always love them. This company was like a big family
bad,I was hired and was going to work 2 jobs my current one and chilis. I was told during the interview that they would work around my schedule but when I went to my orientation I was told my current job was gonna have to work around them. So I didn't stay with chilis it has been 5 months and I still haven't been paid for my orientation and I just keep getting the run around.
bad,"Chili's in Holland does not care that you have a family or a life. Management will disrespect you in front of guests and other servers. They let staff (the very few) that have held positions pretend to be management and throw fits and physically threaten your well being without consequence. They work you doubles, it's bad pay pay with a extremely high turnover. The few that stick it out are constantly picking up and retraining on a near weekly basis."
bad,i worked early mornings. i worked about 3 hours a day. my checks were about 150 and personally for what i did it wasnt worth my time. i wasnt there long.
bad,"Job contains multiple responsibilities outside of position."
bad,My pay was terrible and the way they treated employees are horrible I was working and going to school catching 2 buses sometimes 4 to get to work just to work for 2 hours because we we're to slow my check was nothing the GM didn't want to give me a raise the hardest part about my job was trying to be satisfied with my pay check every two weeks
bad,"I tried to be very professional in my leaving. I put in my 2 weeks and was immediately taken off the schedule. I was then removed from the system. The serving manager then went on to tell the rest of the staff false information, telling them I didn't show up for my shift and quit after giving a year of reliability."
bad,"Never worked at such a bias location like this. Management doesn't care about the employees. Only thing they care about is surveys from Ziosk and all the bonus the managers get from Intent to return score. Makes you push to get 5 stars. Like how 5 stars are 100 and 4 star is zero, 3 star is negative 100. It's not always servers fault. It can be food, bartender, host. They schedule you according to your score. if you have less score they might not even schedule you for the week. Therefore, makes you force to quit. BUT hey, this doesn't apply for managers favorites. They can get all the shifts they want and also whatever section they can be. Manager cannot fire you because you have low scores but definitely can schedule you as a host, to-go person even if you are hired as a server. Stop just worrying about the bonuses you get Managers but also have some respect towards your employees. I wonder why people no-call, no-show at this restaurant and always short staffed."
bad,"Management did not work with your availability, they showed favoritism, and constantly messing up your schedule, long hours, double shifts everyday. People who have small children should not apply. They aren't very busy so your working hard for nothing. You have to ask permission to eat when you are on the clock no exceptions or they throw your food away. There are NO breaks not a 10, 15, or 30. If you have worked all day you still don't get a break. All around the store has no team work and the working conditions are unexceptionable. I receive benefits from the state and when I left Chili's they were suppose to fill out some paperwork and give it back to the state, and they did not. I have a 3 year old and I'm a single mom they did not help at all. They maybe a family restaurant but they are not family orientated with in management and employment"
bad,"It was a part time job that did not provide me with enough hourly pay and the hours were horrible. Could not work the schedule you needed to work, and if someone did not show up on the night shift you would have to stay regardless of if you were working or not."
bad,the management was very neglectful and expected you to do the job of 3 people with very low pay with in 6 hours. the was no organization in management either.
bad,Worst place to work if your a cook or chef all they do when you start is shove you in some corner just make you do salads no cooking what so ever management works you into the ground with one day off a week. Split shifts without telling you. Most of all your mostly just a janitor waiters and waitresses are lousy they dont even clean there area of work. People doing drugs out in the parking lot at work and working under the influence. Not allowed any holidays off. Pay just sucks the worst part there is a great college that has a great culinary arts program but with the way chili's management treats employees no one wants to work at this location thats why there always hiring. When they list a job opening it shouldnt say cook it should say janitor salad person. Such a waste of a place to work for people who have talent.
bad,"I really disliked working at Chili's. I was treated poorly by management and fellow employees. Most acted like it was social time, and really didn't do the work. So for others who took it seriously the work load was too much. If everyone worked as a team things would have ran a lot smoother. I think working at any other chili's would have been fine, it was just the people who worked at this particular one who made it the WORST job I have ever had."
bad,"the employees and managers were rude, and treated me like i wasnt a part of the team, a lot of drama and arguing. over-all it was the WORST place i have ever worked."
bad,"Worked for them as a prep cook,but spent more time playing dishwasher/janitor.when I stepped to the km/gm they said this is where we need you.im fine with being a team player but I was the only one doing this.not a good place to work."
bad,"The managers all have favorites and if you're not one of them, don't even waste your time trying to talk to them about any problems or anything else you might need help with. They curse at their employees and make fun of any problems that they may have. A typical work day for me consists of me listening to my coworkers berate each other and curse at one another. I learned to mind my business, do my job and get out of there as quick as possible. The only enjoyable part of my job is when I clock out to go home at the end of my shift. I've worked a 15 hour shift with no breaks or food. WORST PLACE TO WORK, MANAGEMENT IS TERRIBLE"
bad,"Working at Chilis was one of my biggest mistakes. The co-workers were rude and so was management. The most enjoyable part of my day was talking with customers, thats about it. The managers acted superior and disrespectful. My average day consisted of too much drama for one person to handle and i learned that a corporate business such as Chilis is not for me....and probably not for you either."
bad,"Horrible Management, No breaks, no hours as well as a lot of back talk and threats towards employees. a very unreliable job."
bad,"NO     proper training "
bad,"I was one bad experience after another!! bad management, and a company that doesn't care about it employee's!! ill never work for that company again!!"
bad,"I was a hostess at Chili's for 10 months. We were one of the busiest Chili's in FL and got huge rushes even on weeknights. Wait time was typically 1 1/2 hour, longer for large parties. The management was not cohesive at all, nobody worked as a team and everyone was out to help themselves only, so usually the servers would be mad at the hosts, the kitchen would be mad at the servers, the servers would be mad at the kitchen, the kitchen would be mad at the hosts, and the managers would be mad at everyone. Communication was AWFUL, the headsets were only good to overhear everyone yelling at each other."
bad,"Everything about this job is awful. You do not want to work here. "
bad,"servicing costumers"
bad,"If you are into drama, roomers, partying, drunks, and drug addicts, THIS IS THE PLACE FOR YOU. The employees were a joke just looking for quick cash to get by with no regards for the customers wants and needs. The management was messy and liked to stir the pot with Drama feeding roomers instead of getting down to the root of things and putting a stop to the inappropriate relations that occurred in the restaurant. The cooks were constantly drunk on drugs or completely rude. Not to mention the fact that you are overworked and under appreciated. I would not wish this job on my worst enemy. But if you are looking to make some quick cash and have good customer service skills and do not mind all of the drama and childish shenanigans.. Then this is the job for you."
bad,"Not a place i would recommend to anyone, advancements are based on favorites,  not on a job well done and work ethic. Claims to be FAMILY friendly but goes back on there word everytime."
bad,"Days went by semi fast paced, learned how to cook at a fast pace, management was a joke, co workers all lazy, hardest part of my job was picking up everyone elses slack, most enjoyable was how fast the day went by and being able to keep busy."
bad,there were groups and if you didnt fit in working was miserable the guest didnt tip more than 10% on average there was no communication or teamwork  and the management would rather gossip then work there were favorites and the enviroment was dirty and the place was filled with weasels
bad,Most horrible management ever.  Im not going to waste my time going on about the rest of the negatives about this company and this job.  Only good thing is the wonderful regulars I have after 2 1/2 years of working here.
bad,You go in every day to nothing being stocked. Then you get crushed for lunch and dinner. Then get yelled at by the managers for leaving the line too often because the Kitchen Supervisor didn't stock the line and the management is too concerned about looking good on paper for corporate to actually have decent performance. Do not work here. You will want to club baby seals after three weeks and I've been there for nearly a year.
bad,"Awful company to work for, management is horrible, management mistreats employees and picks favorites. Horrible management in Asheboro."
bad,this place was too hectic and the kitchen would get extremely backed up at times making it impossible to keep guests happy. Managers had attitude which made it difficult when they were supposed to be helping us with a difficult customer.
bad,The co-workers are the only good thing about this place that was even remotely good.Management team is a joke.The general manager was constantly putting people down and saying very mean and personal things.
bad,"GM acts like they are 16, not professional. poor upkeep of the property, sanitation in kitchen not followed. rules constantly changing, GM has favorites, unfair to rest of staff"
bad,very stressful. hostile work environment. horrible management. the hardest part was learning how to multitask. best thing was friends working with me.
bad,"Hated working here mainly because of the management and the way I was paid. I had to rely on customers of the restaurant for my money and although I was told many times I was great the money didn't quite show it. Though it was quite an interesting life experience and being an extrovert I did enjoy meeting new people, I did not like the work schedule and how much I had to work with nothing to show for it."
bad,"Working for this company is the worst experience I have had in a long time. The restaurant itself is unsanitary, unsafe and they will over work you."
bad,"A typical day at work is sometimes extremely overwhelming.  I enjoy most of my co-workers and love all my regulars."
bad,"Assisted diners with seating as needed.Cleaned and maintained the beverage area, display cases, equipment, and order transaction area. Greeted guests and sat them at tables or in waiting areas. Skillfully anticipated and addressed guests' service needs."
bad,i did everything from serve to bar-tend cook and do dishes. management is so bad here. they do not care or take care of their workers
bad,During a typical day of work I deal with a lot of rudeness from not only employees but also the managers. I feel really stressed while working here due to the inappropriate behavior from managers. The managers slander names of servers to other employers. There is also a lot of drug activity from servers that also come to work drunk or with a buzz.
bad,There is a first class action lawsuit against Brinker International for not giving their employees their rightful breaks.
bad,In the short time there I worked very hard but when I was injured badly on my other job and I had to move on they shorted me on my pay check and paid me less than half of what I was owed.  I went to corporate and still didn't get paid the entire amount i was owed.  I wouldn't suggest working for this company.
bad,"Poor Pay, poor management, and poor overall service. No matter how good the employees/coworkers, the businesses overall bad service masks the coworkers abilities."
bad,Weird people to work with very shady lots off drama dirty job cleaning after people
bad,"Inmates are running the asylum managers work like dogs"
bad,"not a good place to work for being a training store employees aloud to no call/no show/ or come in on drugs so messed up that they mess up tables orders. managers kissing employees smacking them on the butt,yelling to where customers can hear,employees getting sick from bad food."
bad,I have never worked for a Corporation that is built so much on empty promises.  The management is a unprofessional and when I decided to say something to air my grievances I was let go.  I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU NOT TO WORK THERE BUT ALSO NOT EAT THERE
bad,"Besides having to pay for parking everyday, standing in obscurely long lines in security, dealing with mean and hateful security, and dealing with poor management, i would not reccomend anyone for this job. The money i made is the only reason i stayed for five years.   They do not care if you are harassed by other employees, as i was and there was nothing done about it. There is favortism showed by all managers there and some of the managers that are sleeping with the employees and it is known by many but there is nothing done about it. You are constantly being harassed by managers and there is nothing you can do but take it because the money is soooooo gooood you dont want to leave. Think twice about your sanity before taking a job with them. Although the money will be good, you have no control over your schedule,working every holiday, staying late with guests, and dealing with immature co workers."
bad,Terrible people work here and want to ruin your life and happiness. Back stabbers are them all!
bad,"A typical day at Chilis is putting the chairs down and prepping everything in the expo line. Examples ice, plates, teas, chips, etc. Management did not have anything together. They bounced around with no team work. They would rather talk to guest and hide in the office. For the 3 years i worked there i had over 15 managers come in and leave. The co-workers did not want to run food but their own. It would take over 2 hours just to close out and clean everything at the end of the day. The only good thing about this job was the friendship I gotten from some the employees and that was it."
bad,I learned how to properly greet & seat customers. the hardest part about this job was not getting enough hours.
bad,they   dont ahve great service  they slow foods under cooked and  lack of respcest between there  employees
bad,There is no typical day at chili's a good day only comes when prep and other items are prepared properly which is a rare causation workers are friend even though they may argue time to time and management is always unprepared when they have 30 or more open menus leaving customers with 20 or more minute waits.
bad,"horrible management,stuck up employees.one of the worst work experiences I have ever had"
bad,Living in Indiana during the unemployment was sky rocketing and no one was getting enough  hours nor not enough money.
bad,Management is terrible.  seems like there was a new manager every month.  Compensation is not fair for the work that is performed.
bad,"no advacenement management  horrible"
bad,"Would only be a great place to start a first job, but quickly learn its not a great place to work, co-workers were lazy, management was lazy and flirting with other workers and chose favorites very quickly"
bad,"As a host or hostess you are responsible for many things. You have to cheerfully greet guests, take them to their table and provide them with silverware and a menu. You'll need to be able to monitor the table rotation and make sure that each member of the wait staff gets a fair amount of tables without giving them too many all at once. At the same time, you'll need to know which servers you can count on to take extra tables when you get slammed with customers. You'll also need to keep track of which tables are cleaned and available for new guests, and you may even be required to answer the phone, take reservations and in some cases take-out orders."
bad,I cannot speak for all chili's locations but the one in Hutchinson had to have the worst manager I have ever heard of. I personaly know of one watress that was recently fired and as a result 3 more employees turned in there notice. This watress has never worked anywhere that she has not been greatly appreciated and they have all complimented her on her work ethics. All of her previous employers have always spoke well of her and would welcome her back to any job she has ever had. I just hope this one manager gets found out soon and gets what he deserves. Someone needs to go under cover and see all that he does. I am certain he will no longer have a job if he is ever found out.
bad,i learned how to be professional you will make great tips. i enjoyed it
bad,hate it. they stole money from me and management did nothing about it. They do not take care of thier employees at all
bad,I make working fun where ever I work because with a bad attitude you have a bad day. So I personally make sure I am in a good mood even if my work place is not. I did not enjoy working here at Chilli's. I had money stolen fron me multiple times and exspressed to the management what was going on and they did nothing about it so I told them I could no longer work in a place like that. They do not care about thier employees and they will run you into the ground if you let them. You will work for basically nothing.
bad,Worst place i have ever worked....they treat their employees like dirt and they dont work with u if u have an emergency. they have dropped food on the floor in the kitchen and picked it up and have put right back in a container or back on the cooking surface to sell to guest.
bad,"I worked at a Chili's for several years . The one I worked at was terrible , lazy co-workers and all of the managers had their favorites . Never tell you that you are doing a good job , make you do several job duties for 2.13 and hour . No place to work !"
bad,"Before I begin, I may be a former employeee, but I am not disgruntled. Everything that I wrote I stand by it. I was not fired I quit. These are my reviews of this restaurant would be this. I would rather be unemployed than work for this company. The management staff are of no use. They are never around when you need them (always in the office). The kitchen manager was never in the kitchen (always in the front of the house). I think that the GM is an unfair person (he would let the Mexicans blast their music and the black folks could not listen to their music because the GM did not like that type of music. The management staff did promote a happy work environment. The way the management team dressed is horrendous. There is not sense of professionalism in that restaurant they all need to be FIRED!!!!!"
bad,"Needs new management, unprofessional, very nosy, disrespectful."
bad,"I've read all these ""reviews"" and wonder, are these reviews from corporate??? The owners????? I don't understand???? The pay is BAD, they make you work the stations from prep, cook to clean up with absolutely NO help. 20 orders on the screen and managers and wait staff yelling to hurry up as you do it BY YOURSELF!!!!! You actually have to clean the walls and ceiling every night and i actually melted the souls of my shoes because I had to stand on the stove to clean air vents. if you close, you close by yourself, no manager will EVER help you, you walk out at 2-3am totally grimmed up like you work for the oil rigs (at least you get paid there and can make a living) People walk out (employees) can't keep staff, big turnover. Good free food but darn if you don't pay for it in other ways. I pay more income tax then the Gen Manager"
bad,managers where way too young. if you where not buddy buddy with the managers they would not treat you good.
bad,Communication between management was horrible. Upper level managers did not help in the development of the newer managers.
bad,I get about 8 hours a week if I am lucky. They schedule me when I am supposed to have class. And have been telling me for a month now that they would promote me to a server and it still hasn't happend.
bad,Trash management poor staffing want you to be a slave they talk to you sideways let food sit n window and get cold instead of running the food out to the guests
bad,To many management changes and training managers who do not understand  the job. So much lack of communication and every day there is a new promotion that like $5.00 for a meal
bad,"Al principio buena experiencia de pronto te das cuenta que hay mucha opresion ,sobre todo favoritismo , exeso de horarios (no pagan hrs extra). Pesima comida de empleado (estuve en dos tiendas diferented y es lo mismo hay dias que teniamos  que comprar comida aparte )  o dias que no podias comer ,te exigen  pero es muy raro que den algo a cambio ...  si pides  el puesto de server(mesero)  en ocasiones no dejan propina y hay que reponerla . En ocasiones muy estresante el ambiente con los gerentes . El ambiente se vuelve pesado con los supervisores de tienda y gerentes de tienda. EXIGEN DEMACIADA LIMPIEZA ANTES Y DESPUES DE LABORAR OJO EN OCASIONES LLEGA SER EXAGERADO ."
bad,"Extreme Favortism. "
bad,It’s just a very stressful place management is treats everyone like they t 5 yr old kids instead of respectful adults! It’s not a busy place! Worst restaurant to work at
bad,"I've been working there for over a year and even after busting my tail at every shift and asking for more hours, I've progressively gotten less and less. The people I trained there completely work my original position now and I hardly get scheduled for my other position now."
bad,"Not allowed to think for yourself. Have a bunch of math nerds at corporate who never worked in a kitchen coming up with equations telling you what and when to cook. No human element, kind of ridiculous and usually inaccurate."
bad,i worked at 2 different locations and the difference depending on the location i was at was tremendous. the respect between manangement and regular staff was pretty much nonexistant. there are no benefits offered and no insentive to stay there much show up to work everyday. i have worked in he restaurant industry for 20 years and this was one of the worst places i have ever worked.
bad,"Do not recomend managing there, it is disorganized nightmare, go in a differint direction. Stay away, do not pass go, you will not collect $200 anyway. They promote brown nose managers anf.many.manager as Gm's from outside sources."
bad,i worked as a dishwasher and it was the worst job ever. crazy fast pace and no help at all. terrible bosses and your treated like trash by everyone. dont work here ever.
bad,"I would stay away from this company, inconsistent standards. 3 for $10 has made it almost impossible for the front of the house staff to survive. No accountability or Integrity."
bad,"I would never recommend to work there. The managers did not care for the environment, pay was ridiculously low and never raised, even though I worked there for nearly two years. Never going back."
bad,"I was hired as a prep cook full time and was given an average of 35-40 hours per week during training. Then after completing training was only given 8-16 hours per week. When asked about getting more hours, was told ther was “nothing they could do”"
bad,Chili’s works the servers as hard as they can. They do not have a Busser ever. Servers are expected to keep the line stocked with dishes. The opening and closing duties are ridiculous. You have so many responsibilities outside of taking care of guests it’s hard to make your guests happy. The 3 for 10 meal deal kills your sales and makes you work twice as hard for half of the money. This place is a nightmare. The management gets a bonus for lower labor percentages so the floor is always understaffed. No one I work with is happy here. We are all trying to get different jobs. You can’t even add gratuity to parties of 6 or more. I’ve seen people get completely stiffed on parties of 20! Chili’s absolutely does not care about the servers whatsoever. It is the lowest end of any of the places I have ever served.
bad,"The GM is constantly yelling & swearing at the employees. She calls them out & belittles them infront of their colleagues. Then complains to her favorite people about the ones she doesn't like. She needs some serious management training, or a new job. She doesn't belong in the position she's in. Pot smoking is also allowed in the parking lot. Really?"
bad,The management has a very unorganized rotation for the servers. The guest never pay well due to the cooks not doing their job efficiently. The servers always call in so it causes a back up.
bad,"I recently left Chili's after having been a manager for the past six years in the Midwest. I got sick and tired of dealing with an Area Director who was completely incompetent and useless. He never came around, and when he did, he would unfairly comment on my job performance without any basis in fact."
bad,Extremely low quality establishment hardly superior to fast food establishments...the main issue being insufficient compensation and complete lack of talent from all positions
bad,The managers are a joke and it’s so stressful! The company does not care about their employees! Its always what you have done wrong and not a positive place to work! There is no loyalty in this company and I worked for them in a few states and it was the same!
bad,Chilis in Muncie is an awful place to work. They keep you on shift for hours and hours and you don't get a break to eat or drink. You go home smelling like dirty fryers.
bad,"Managers were very judgemental and always chose favorites. The clientele was bad, so bad tips. I never made over $50. And I have been serving for a very long time and I have always made good money anywhere else I served. They also give you your shifts based off of how many surveys you receive even though half the time the ziosks don’t work so people can’t even leave you surveys. They never gave me a good section and pretty much drove me away. After putting in my two weeks they were really mean and nasty to me. They dropped the 2 to go shifts that I had and kicked me off of hot schedules. Do not work here."
bad,"No room for growth, had fellow managers on 20 years hadn't advanced. Not a fun environment for work, fellow managers where mean and abusive to employees, had favorite employees treated differently"
bad,Some days you weren't sure if it was going to be busy or slow. Co-workers can be rude or disrespectful at times. Management was very poor and so was the pay.
bad,"High stress environment with lackluster management, complete lack of accountability throughout the company. Disgusting food service health practices in the back of the restaurant. Disconnection from mission statement and actual practices."
bad,"I'm sorry but this company is a complete joke to work for, they treat you like you are nothing, criticize but don't help and have awful attitudes. The cook's are the meanest people I've ever met in a restaurant. There really was nothing good about this job, just a bunch of backstabbing and attitudes. I would not recommend them to anyone."
bad,"Worst job I've ever had and worst company I've ever worked for. Impossible to advance from BOH to FOH, and they don't care about your needs for time off at all. They deny time off to BOH employees all the time because of lack of coverage, which is not fair at all. Servers get all the glory and all the money at Chili's, and they don't care about the peers that make the food, prep the food, and clean the dishes. All employees that work in the BOH of Chili's will eventually hate their job and want to quit, please don't work for Chili's."
bad,"people dont seem to learn anything, people dont care, don't waste your time, they can't staff any of the locations and then corporate complainss that stores arent hitting their numbers"
bad,"Seven GM Managers is six years, To much on the body, mind and soul. Felt alienated by top management. No work balance at all. Quality of life is always second to profits. The atmosphere was contentious all the time. I would not recommend Chili's as a place of employment."
bad,this place is average to work at. nothing stands out. no greedy management no playing favorites. just come in get your work done make money and go home type of place
bad,"Some of my co-workers were amazing! I did not like the management there at all, they were super unprofessional!!! None of the managers deserved their job. If you can deal with getting unfair hours and being made to stay late while being leave after only being at work for an hour than go for.. if not then i wouldnt suggest this job.. Duties at this job were fine and easy sometimes even fun but the management wasnt worth a 200 a week pay"
bad,"I've worked at 2 different chilis in twouldn't different statea. One disaster to another. Its all filled with bad management, always understaffed. They use and abuse you till they might not need you anymore, hard work goes unrecongized. No benefits especially working 40 hrs a week as a server, very dirty alot of cross contamination. Runs through managers. They use a system called team service which used to be awesome! But seems like nowadays everyone is out for themsleves, including management."
bad,"great time ,great team , atmosphere wonderful company , full days hard but fun work, Best restaurant company to work for ,amazing people.learned customer service"
bad,"Management is the downfall, which sucks because the store can pretty much run itself when the ""team"" is in positive motion. There is potential, but only once reality settles in management & COMMUNICATION. The pay for prep cooks is horrible, as well as line cooks. Haven't been in both positions, including the frequent dish runs, I would have to definitely say there should be an increase in the compensation. Prep cooks are the most important, followed by the line cooks whom cooks what prep cooks prep. Obviously, if there were prep, then there would be an issue right?"
bad,"Easy job. You get verbally insulted a lot. Try not to have family, because they don't care about it. Don't waste your time."
bad,"I worked for chili's for 8 years and in that 8 years never got one chance to show my leadership skills, many other got chances to become managers but only one person made out of 10 in the 8 years I worked there. the pay sucked as well was promised one raise every year but only saw 4 at 2% Chili's is the wal-mart of the restaurant world. also when I started we had paid vacations and affordable health ins. now there are no vacations and very expensive Ins. if you work hard and want to advance in you career chili's is not for you."
bad,The restaurant I worked at was horrid! They were never prepared for high-volume. The company doesn't care less about their employees unless you're management. The hours are wildly erratic. The only way this would be a good job is if you were very young and only wanted it to be temporary. This is the second worse job I've ever had. I used to wish I would get in an accident on my way to work so I would feel like it was okay not to work. I HATED IT!!!
bad,"There are very few things I can say about the General state of the restaurant that are positive besides the cleanliness of the Front of House, and the non management staff. "
bad,"Chilis taught me a lot about the food industry. I worked for the company(brinker owned) for six and a half years.  I had many ups and down but I do not believe the company cares about thier employees at all! They worry about labour more then anything. You have to work split shift(doubles) in order to accumulate hours, which you can barely get. 30 hours is considered FULL TIME!?!?  The benefits?! Where I never recieved any...they took vaction time away except for managers!  The health insurance is horrible with only little coverage and a whimpy discount card that isnt accepted anywhere! Chilis makes everyone spread over many roles having 1 person do 3 jobs at a time with tons of chaos! The Qa is totally unappreciated and not respected at all! I loved learning new things and chilis was great at keeping menu updated but the execution of the dishes are horrible.  My stress level was off the charts the last year here and it wasn't the business of it because I opened the restaurant and experienced high volumes of guests but its how they perform that is sad.  No team work what so ever!! Please do not work for this company! !! You will regret it! I promise you.. I slaved for six years with nothing to show for it!  "
bad,Did not work with family schedule.  They do not work well with family schedule.  They give very little notification on upcoming shift schedule to be able to work around family obligations.
bad,"Terrible lazy discouraging management, they take advantage of and exploit the good workers and leach off of them rather than hiring more dependable people or more people in general. Not the greatest sanitary practices. Togo gets stiffed all the time. They let anyone become a manager which leads to more & more problems. Training process is pathetic even for managers, often found they did not know how to speak to customers how they should or make sure they were happy and satisfied if there was a problem  much better companies to work for"
bad,"If you don't want to return to high school and have to  play favorites with your managers, I wouldn't work here. The shifts you received are not at all based on performance. And if you don't play kiss my behind, they will run you out"
bad,not a good work environment management no good high turn over rate low salaries no hours for employees limited staff late work hours low .quality food
bad,It pays well and the people who work there in the restaurant work as team usually are the reasons why people don’t want to leave.  The state of CA faces incredibly challenging times ahead trying to retain talented people and stay profitable as a business
bad,"They give you an 8 table section, then seat you all at once with no support. On a weekend night because their meal are so cheap your still lucky if you have 500 in sales"
bad,Over worked and under paid for a company who just sees you as an employee number. They have an amazing General Manager but the District Manager is completely incompetent!! I do not recommend this for anyone with experience but if you need some experience it may be for you.
bad,"The managers were plain out disrespectful and rude, the customers were rude as well, and co workers were lazy and didn’t want to do their job. Often times I found my self doing someone’s else’s work. There was definitely favoritism as well with the managers. No matter how hard you tried to work. The managers have said some of the meanest things I’ve ever heard working at a “professional” work environment. Had to report two for that behavior! Worst part was being sexually harassed by a cook in the back because a manager didn’t want to do their job."
bad,"I worked at a few different Chili's in my career as a BOH and FOH team member. The other Chili's that I worked at, I enjoyed going to work, the people, management and over all culture. I would have to say that far and away this is the worst establishment and management that I worked for. The constant petty comments, the inconsistent management direction and work details created a rift between myself and the job I loved for so long. I love the Chili's brand, for it was my first real job. But this establishment killed any passion I had for a lasting career with Chili's."
bad,"Gave my all for this company. Worked hours I didnt get compensated for if we were short staffed, amongst other things. Got taken advantage of by managers because my dedication was mistaken for weakness."
bad,I learn that Chili's management team way a cut throat type of job. No one was easy to work with. I never in my life would I believe that the entire crew couldn't get along. This crew did a lot of back stabbing each other.
bad,"I liked working here but my co workers made working here stressful and annoying. They were very immature and unprofessional. No one knew about teamwork, I actually had an incident with a manager in which he ended up fired. So if you can handle working with young minded selfish annoying adults as your coworkers then this is the place for you."
bad,"yup it was pretty bad but a great learning experience, I will definitely use what I learned at this place of work elsewhere in life,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"
bad,"The food quality is inconsistent at best. Cooks don’t care about the quality or the wait times. Servers have to put out fires and management doesn’t care enough to help. Restaurant is constantly under staffed and also running out of product. The restaurant is full of drama. Management turns the other way. Lower management does drugs at work with employees, no respect."
bad,"What can I say? It sucks! The culture is that of unreliability and frustration of having to pickup the pieces of the people who don’t even want to put in effort. Management is many times a swing and a miss; some of my managers were even fired for punching a wall and sexual discrimination. It’s a bummer of a place and I could only stand working there a year. There are much better places to work, I promise."
bad,"The company is set-up to save money and doesn't care about its paying customers. Servers are expected to Serve, bus tables, food run, prepare certain things and even host and expo when they're trying to save on labor which makes it almost impossible to properly take care of customers. As a result the restaurant is always dirty and has a VERY high turnover rate. As for weekly scheduling, the management isn't very involved in their employees lives and lately there often seems to be discrepancies with it among employees. There is also a lack of communication with coworkers and management because the only ones that have meetings are management so employees feel like their concerns aren't being heard. All around this is the most physically and mentally exhausting company I have ever worked for."
bad,This is the most unorganized place i’ve ever worked at and it was very unenjoyable. The people who worked there were good but the management did not have things under control.
bad,No sense of teamwork. Management doesn’t communicate with each other well. Most workers seem unhappy. Noticed lots of policies that you learn were ignored
bad,"The worst place I have ever worked. Area director was ridiculous. No leadership. Standards were not followed. They settled for low expectations from all of the staff. As a manager I could eat for free and come in with my family and eat for free.....I never ate at the restaurant I worked at in Alexandria, La nor did I let my friends or family eat there. I would bring a sandwich and water with me daily!!!"
bad,No coordination with the servers and bartenders m. The restaurant is a constant mess and is filled with employees who do not do their job leaving the work environment extremely unrecognizable
bad,I was let go from this management position all because my boss did not like me. This brand does not take care of their team members. It is just 10 weeks of training and then out to the sharks.
bad,"Worked here for four years and all I’ve got to say is don’t. Management and corporate is an absolute joke. If you stand up and point out their wrongs or illegal activity they will retaliate against you by either cutting your hours, ignoring you, or gossiping and spreading lies. You have to and are expected to work off the clock when your last table leaves to clean the restaurant if you don’t clock out they will personally clock you out or fix your hours so it doesn’t affect their labor. Corporate is no help and GM isn’t either. If you aren’t a favorite then good luck. Very hostile work environment. If you don’t wear makeup you’re gonna have to learn to unless you want to be harassed the entire shift. I would not recommend working here. All they care about is how the store looks not about their employees."
bad,Management just throws u on a dirty station unstocked and  tells u look at chart to figure stuff out.  Microwave shrimp and other food items for the price people pay.  The place was :dirty as heck and nobody cared.
bad,"The moment anyone proves themselves to be a reliable worker, they will never see the light of day becuase of this desecration of the food industry. They will give you back to back 13-14 hour shifts 4-5 days in a row until you are ready to pass out on your feet, giving you barely enough time to rest enough to stand again before giving you some more"
bad,The other employees were the only reason I stayed at chilis as long as I did. The management was poor on a good day and the customers made it so much worse.
bad,"Horrid hours, under paid to do a job that will bust your back throughout the day. Usually understaffed and if you tell them you can’t come because you’re sick they will tell you to come in either way. People are cool but the job isn’t worth the time. Would not recommend at all especially since I worked at my local chili’s for 2 years."
bad,"There is no room for growth, unless you are a server or bartender, or friends with management. Other than that be prepared to work long hours with no breaks and little pay."
bad,"Chili’s is a horrible place to work because upper management will do anything to save any amount of money, including cutting a silverware roller’s hours down from 15 hours a week to 10 even though they can easily afford the 15 hours a week."
bad,if your not a woman you wouldn't advance at this location.i would slave at this job get no recognition while the girls walked around on their cellphones and talked on the companys dime.
bad,"Chili's keeps lowering the prices so people come in and get the cheapest things on the menu and then only leave a dollar or two. Management doesn't really care about the employees, most of them will go sit in the office and play on their phones. The kitchen staff doesn't care about getting the food right the first time and they get mad if it comes back because it was made wrong. All around a terrible place to work."
bad,Well I guess is a good place to work if your a young adult. The work place can be great if everyone had common sense and understand what team work really is. The manager are ok. The place make decent money from a business point of view. Its just a job
bad,"System is badly designed for high volume,  employees are bottom level,  do not care about their work.  Management teams are poor, do not hold people accountable."
bad,Training and Management below standard. Often overheard supervisors demeaning staff and gossiping to other favored staff. More of a social click than a business.
bad,"AlSea es una buena cadena pero lamentablemente las administraciones son pesimas, obligan al garzon a entregar el 30% de la propina y dicen que para todos y es falso pues gran parte la roban y el resto lo reparten por eso los sueldos de cocina son super malos, los ascenso no son por desempeño...en conclusion en muchos locales pf changs chilis pesima administración y mas en arauco"
bad,"No real benefits to this job. I had to work til 2 am sometimes only making 12$ an hour. Then, I would have to return at 7:30 in the morning. They promised me to be able to move to front of house after they got more cooks but never full-filled it. Would not recommend."
bad,"My managers do not tend to customers when asked to, the cooks cuss us like dogs, they do not make our food when they are mad at us most of the time we have to go into the kitchen and get it our selves. cooks drop food on the floor and then proceed to serve the food to customers. We are given days on the schedule based on our customer surveys which aren't fair because the questions on the survey do not ask only about the server they ask about how was the food how was the environment was the store clean ( we have roaches EVERYWHERE) it asks other questions but it isn't fair the way we are treated. I would tell anyone trying to decide whether to work there or not, to RUN!! run fast and far away from this place. We aren't granted any breaks at all. The air is out and cooks and servers and guests all are hot and sweaty we have to continue to work and not complain or we will have days taken off schedule. tips suck because cooks never cook correctly we are barely trained to be servers if you could even call what they do training. Chilis is a joke. I hope this gets back to corporate and they do an investigation something like the undercover boss for this place. Oh, and one last thing, we aren't even able to go to Human Resources because one of the managers will tell everyone and have everyone gossip and turn on you. I've seen it happen first hand."
bad,"not a company to work for. the mgt team for the most part could caree less about you. the place is run by its employees due to lack of support from its gm, business has gone down hill in the year i was there and dosent show signs of improving."
bad,"The customers are not even the bad part, the managers ask you to lie to make their store look good, they make you clock out while you're still required to work. They change your schedule at a moments notice and than fire you for reasons with no proof. If you don't compromise your integrity and lie and cheat the system then you get your hours cut. I would not recommend at least the liberty chili's. I'm glad i kept my integrity to the end."
bad,"I worked at Chili's for almost 3 years as a server. I used to love my job up until there was a change in management. The managers that came in were more concerned with their ""numbers"" rather than being appreciative of the employees and appeasing guests. There was a cut back on labor, so a typical lunch shift that used to run smoothly, was chaotic. We ran almost 30 minute ticket times due to shortage of cooks, only because these people were too cheap to schedule enough staff to run the restaurant efficiently. "
bad,Worst place I've ever been employed will not recommend. Management is out of control and staff is on drugs  that location should be shut down asap.   Cooperations like this can't succeed
bad,If you really like being treated like a piece of gum at the bootom of your shoe then this is the job for you. Management never knows how to handle a situation and if it is handled improperly the management staff will find a way to put the blame on a lower status employee so that they can save their job.
bad,Chili's Pace is a hostile work environment. Management is not sensitive to employees needs. The guests are regularly witness to management yelling at employees. I don't recommend it.
bad,"Unable to maintain any type of structure from top to bottom. The location Augusta, Georgia. The company did not understand how to promote from within, and utilize the talent pool."
bad,"I was a dish washer at chili's and I was the only dishwasher cleaning, stocking and doing other things in between . they expect you to have all the dishes clean while there's dishes coming in constantly . the managers are rude and make you feel like its your fault that there's a lot of dishes coming in. Even when working super fast the dishes still pile up. When you go on break they just want you to take A ten min break. You can take a 30 min if you want, but while you're force feeding yourself all the dishes are getting more stacked which makes you work more when you come back. Nobody helps you even tho they say they do. This job changed my personality while I was working there I would be  mad every day and felt like I was going to collapse at work . I don't recommend chilli's at all. A lot of other workers that aren't dishwashers hate that place too."
bad,"Chili's was very hectic all the time and the management was unprofessional. I learned the importance of separating work and pleasure because of the issues and situations that arise as a result of combining the two. This is not a personal realization, rather an observation."
bad,"couldn't get enough hours.  Wouldn't be put in the position I applied for.  Kept hiring people to advance over me, instead of advancing from within.  Terrible pay."
bad,"I worked here for a year, doing nothing but fold the silverware in napkins. Literally that was my job, i asked countless times to wash dishes for more money, but it never happened. The servers always had very inappropriate conversations and played loud music with cursing in it. I once saw a waiter SPIT IN FOOD!"
bad,"The company lost focus of who is important (the Guest)"
bad,"Schedules are not posted until the day before the new schedule starts.  All management cares about are your Ziosk scores, which are actually deceptive because most of the time they are either filled out by a server whose table left without taking the survey or they are based on how attractive the server is.  We are usually understaffed because many employees just no call no show or call in at the last minute without trying to find someone to cover their shift, and no one is repremanded for it because they need employees so badly.  Management also has you do other work that is definitely not in your job description for a good amount of time after you are cut and never plan on compensating you for that.  Employees are also extremely sensitive there getting angry over the smallest things, including kitchen staff. Some employees even take it out physically.  The health department comes and I don't know how our kitchen passes code sometimes. I suppose it is a great facade that is put on while the department is there, but once they are gone, back to nasty as usual. I wouldnt eat there myself.  What more can I say?  The management just thinks everything is great because their heads are in the clouds since sales are better than in the past since they took over, but they do not give a dam* about their employees.  I know this is seen a lot in restaurants. I have experienced it myself a couple times, but this is really bad.  I believe some employees are brainwashed enough to not care since the management seems friendly, but it's pretty apparent to me, this management is very poor.  There"
bad,I have not enjoyed working at chili's. The management is less than helpful and the scheduling is spotty at best for many employees.
bad,"It was great money, but the environment makes you feel as if you are back in middle school. The General Manager is only concerned with himself, and hangs out with employees on the weekends. He schedules the people who are personally close to him, even though they do not do their job. I will never work/eat here again"
bad,"if you don't have a ton of serving job experience i don't recommend the chillis in corpus extremely busy all week and its for very experienced servers , very humbling job."
bad,It was a high school job as a busser. Dont really remeber all of the the detail is was so long ago but I don't have the option of not reviewing the past employer
bad,"In the past 5 1/2 yrs working for Chilis was so awesome, exciting, joyous, all around fun place to work. Made many relationships with co-workers and guest, Management team were all about there employees, handling feedback and situations like the professional they are. New management came in the past 6 months partiality & favoritism ran rapid allowing unacceptable behavior from team members. That was the hardest part of the job, having to endure & accept such behavior. Not the Chili Culture that I was raised & taught the past 5 1/2yrs. The most enjoyable part of my job was The Guest, & the relationships that we built up in our little community ."
bad,"Any cook in this place should find it to be an insult to be hired. Let face it your employer thinks your trained monkeys. Let's take the average loser, put a chief hat on him, cook the food in a factory, freeze, then heat up in a microwave, slap it on a plate and there you have it, trained monkeys. They don't cook, create, design or have any say in the food, just microwave and shut up. Which is ok if your a re tard or a mindless pen dot worker. But what about the customers? Is what you see on tv the reality or a huge disappointment. Can you say ""disappointment""! The food is at best a tv dinner at an overpriced faulse advertisement. Nothing that should be feed to an animal let alone a human. Nothing and I mean nothing is true about their advertising. All smoke and mirrors to empty your wallet and leave you at the mercy of the last legal drug pusher and the least talented Americans on the planet. "
bad,prior management at my location. lazy co workers. typically worked lunches
bad,"I didn't like being a cook. Great steady work, good managers who care about their job, terrible servers, great cooks"
bad,"Stressful and understaffed work environment. Management, GM’s and CEO care more about labor costs to benefit their own bonuses than the efficiency and success of their employees and restaurant.  You are scheduled based off of favoritism and reviews you have no control over unless you guilt the customer into giving a good review. For example, food comes out cold or takes too long the server is penalized because the reviews do not pertain to the SERVICE! Takes money out of servers pockets to compensate for lowering kitchen wages. Incentive is at an all time do to greediness from up above."
bad,"was a host , they mainly focus on the customers don’t really care for their employees the managers are extremely selfish and unprofessional, only seem to care for themselves. Very manipulative toxic environment. Wouldn't recommend staying at a job like that."
bad,I had to deal with doing others work.. dealing with unprofessional management but we would always make sure our customers were satisfied although there were a lot of complaints
bad,Used to be a great company that cared about its people That has gone away and most of their talent has left or been run off  Would be a horrible company for young managers because they are sliding down hill fast
bad,"Worst job ever!!! Training sucked all he did was watch my do everything while he took it easy.. Way too much work for one person you walk in for you shift and it's already slammed with dishes because no one did anything the whole day.. if you're okay with being a slave and just feeling like a dumpster that everyone throws stuff at you, and you don't mind getting off at 2 at night then this is a job for you"
bad,"Chilis has the worst management! They pick favorites and allow many people to get away with things they shouldn’t! The work environment is very toxic! If a manager had a problem with you, they will pick on you and single you out!"
bad,"I very briefly worked for a Chili's location that has never truly found its rhythm since opening 2 years ago. Very high turnover in all positions and poor reviews and I can see why. Most of the staff was new when I was hired and I feel I was set up for failure. As a new server I was left alone several hours at close with the expectation that I would be able to handle a 9-10 PM rush alone and quadruple sat during a busy saturday lunch shift after taking a party of 8 and had to rely on coworkers to help. I will say many of my fellow servers were extremely kind and helpful people. "
bad,"Management embodies the definition of bullying. Co-workers were very cliquey, much like working in high school but with “adults”. There were a few good ones here and there but overall a very hostile work environment. You can get fired for your numbers from surveys on the Ziosks, even though most of the questions don’t particularly apply to your service- mostly kitchen related, except they don’t effect anyone except you as the server. Tips were really good and I was able to pay my bill though"
bad,"Ambiente laboral malo, compañerismo peor, gerentes incompetentes que se preocupan mas por andar de ""tras"" de las mujeres que en hacer su trabajo y dificilmente existe una posibilidad de crecer dentro de la empresa si no, estas de ""barber@"" con los gerentes, por mas buen trabajo que realices."
bad,"Chilis East  Northport was incredibly poorly managed. its as if the managers were on a mission to hire only the laziest and most incompetent people they ever encountered. because of the gross incompetence of the staff, guests would get bad service and not return, making the restaurant slow and that means servers weren't making enough money"
bad,"This was one of the worst experiences I have ever had. First and foremost, I became a full-time employee who was classified as 'part-time'. Probably to avoid paying for benefits. The dish pit is severely understaffed. A typical day will involve starting in the late afternoon. As soon as you walk in, you are overwhelmed with a huge stack of dishes from the busy lunch crowd; along with having to clean up from the prep cooks. All the while, trying to keep up with the busy dinner crowds. AND, then comes the break down after the place has closed for the night. Some nights, you have to do all this by yourself. Some nights, you get to work with the only other dishwasher on staff - for a few hours, only. All the while, dealing with a bunch of servers who can't tell the difference between silverware (most often, they didn't know the difference between spoons, forks and knives) and trash and/or the difference between trash cans and the floor. In the 16 months I was there, I NEVER got a real lunch break. There was no time. If I were to try and take one, there is NO relief in the dish pit and the dishes will just pile up; putting you right back where you started when you walked in."
bad,"I was a host at Chili's. It was okay at first until I realized how bad it was. It's really stressful because you have to make sure the servers are ready for another table and sometimes you have to bus their tables because they're either too busy or too lazy. Management is awful. There's barely any communication between them and it's like they don't care sometimes about their employees. Then they wonder why no one wants to keep their employees are leaving. They just show up and leave. A lot of the employees are pretty cool though. When it comes time when you need a day off and someone needs to cover your shift...good luck. As a server, you get pretty good money depending if you work a lot. Don't get me wrong it's a good place to start, but not a good place if you want to stay there for a while."
bad,"Poor management leads to a very high stress environment. High employment turn over rate, sickness due to stress. Lacking Important people skills to.to p"
bad,They only had o e Diswasher even on the  weekends. Not a clean place to work or eat at. To much work for one diswasher. I did not like working there. I would not work there ever again. Not enough  hours or pay.
bad,"Communication was negative at chilis so the schedules, hours, and management were always all over the place. Fights were often on shifts among coworkers and the turnover rate is extreme."
bad,"Managers have favorites regardless of their work ethic. "
bad,"No support from Corp.  cut prices, cut margins, then complained about sales and PPA.  Could not attract quality employees because we could not pay them.  You pay $11/hr for a cook...... you get what you pay for!  You offer two complete meals for $20.... you attract the bottom of the barrel for customers.  No pride in product, so they cut prices to attract anyone they can!"
bad,"Work based on a volume style work schedule, insanely understaffed and work life balance is garbage. Money is not worth the insane amounts of stress the job puts on you and trying to keep a level head and stay calm is 0% possible."
bad,I would go in at 7:30 or 8 and work till 7. I would start getting the line set up and peeping things that we would need for the day once open I would work 2 stations.
bad,"Chili's is very unorganized and has staff that can be extremely difficult to work with. Many people quit in their first month, first few weeks, or even first day, making it challenging to have an organized schedule. The management is also extremely unorganized as far as keeping up with employees."
bad,Great company to work for lack of advancement for minorities. Very much a good old boy network not at all depictive of its customer base and those who frequent their  locations in essence their patrons. Staff works so many long and hard hours they become family you spend more time at work than at home for sure
bad,"I worked at  Chili's for about 7 months and it got worse as time went on. All of the experienced staff had left and they were employing people that had no serving experience and dumping them right on the floor. The experienced servers had to make up for their lack of knowledge and organization. I originally was hired and I stated I did not want to close 6 days a week because I was in school but I ended up closing 6 days a week. I would not leave until about 1 a.m if I was lucky. After trying to talk to the managers about it they continued to brush it off and not listen to my requests to close less. I gave them over a month to adjust the schedule and find another closer but they didn't, there excuse was that most of the other servers couldn't handle closing. I was working over 40 hours a week and was completely drained. Upper management wanted to cut back on hours at the location so the managers were cutting almost all servers and leaving two servers to for 3-4 hours every night. Sometimes we would have 12-16 tables plus large parties of 10 or more  walk in at 9 p.m and there were only two servers left on the floor. The kitchen was always messing up orders and it was very unsanitary so there were constantly dishes being sent back. If you want to be stressed out 24/7 and hate your job then I would suggest you work at Chili's.. otherwise stay far far away."
bad,management at Odessa texas location is a joke. especially if you are ever scheduled to work with a so called manager they call miss b... a b alright.. horrible
bad,"One of the busiest restaurants in the town that I live in yet on any given night we don't have either to go people, hosts, dish washer, or enough cooks; some times all of the above or just missing one of the above. That makes the whole restaurant stretch thin and have to pick up the slack for an already over demanding job as it is. Management is often lazy and does not pick up any of the slack from missing components of the shift it's left up to everyone else, which makes you feel like you are set up to fail."
bad,Can’t find a manager in the building half the time. Servers do and say whatever they want at the expense of the guest. One manager was decent but the other three are just incompetent and lazy.
bad,"I've been apart of many restaurants but this imperticular restraunt was the worst I've ever seen I was lied to as soon as I was hired tried to keep a host as a host as long as possible without advancement but will tell you diffrently. If you dont know them or a little diffrent I wouldnt work here. Tried to have me clean toilets, bus tables, wipe tables, clean all restrooms, sweep, run food,  and pre bus guest tables. With no tips and no respect"
bad,"leaned a lot in the kitchen, learned how to wok in a very busy establishment. at times we were very short staffed. great experience. great customers!."
bad,Some people are on high horses and treat you like you dont know what your doing. Its unacceptable. You have to ask the managers more than once for what you need. You ask for help and its like you done stabbed the person you asked helped from. Its supposed to be team work. But its dog eat dog there.
bad,The work environment was way too stressful and my manager was rude and two-faced. They would compliment me on improvements but then keep insisting that the job wasn't for me and I finally got fed up with their mixed messages.
bad,"If you like being told you have potential and that advancements are available then this is the place for you, just know that after 10 years you more then likely will still be in the same position as when you where hired."
bad,"I have worked for this company almost 2 years and have not once been promoted or given a raise. Constantly having to beg for hours just to feed myself while the management does NOTHING to help out their team members. I consistently while serving tables have had to go cook my own food for my table while the management sits in the office. When I finally got more hours they gave me 2 hourly shifts a week and as a server I never see that money so there have been many days where I work for ""free"". Have cleaned and detailed that restaurant top to bottom, helped out other store by working for them when they need help, learned all the positions in order to try and be promoted up or to just overall help but they dont return the favor nor do they care about trying to help their employees."
bad,"Sexist and age discrimination, hostile work environment, preferential treatment for male employees.  Schedules are constantly changed for different measurements."
bad,"This place is poorly ran, poorly maintained, poorly managed and there are very few employees who are trained correctly or held accountable for their immature/unprofessional actions."
bad,Horrible adherence to proper food preparation and storage guidlines. Filthy and disgusting restaurant. The managers dont care about the success of the restaurant
bad,"They did not give you the tools to succeed. I worked very hard and would pick up shifts when they fell short. I had to wash my own silverware. They let some staff do nothing, while others had to pick up their slack just to get a shift started and ready. They base your shifts on a survey the patrons would do. If they were not happy with the food then my scores would go down. Nothing to do with me at all."
bad,"I worked here for a little over a year, and I have to say it was horrible. The people I worked with her great, but the overall atmosphere was horrible. No room to advance, the pay is terrible, and you become a SLAVE to the company."
bad,"This company does not believe in family values and doing the right thing. They are out for them and only them!  From HR, Regional directors, to area directors, all they care about is themselves and the power they have over their stores. Terrible place to work and good quality is no where to be seen. Most all good is cooked in microwaves and everything comes in frozen. My advice is look elsewhere!!!"
bad,Company is too small and is focused on themselves and not taking care of their managers. I was the service manager and the work and life balance is right out of balance.
bad,"It Basically sucks, other employees are rude, mangaers are inapproprate and rude and show favorites and if you are not a favorite you are scewed because you will never move up, and will be walked all over. Tips suck too."
bad,"Chilis was horrible. Your supply budgets were so tight that you regularly ran out of various items throughout the week, making you have to drive to another store to borrow items. Tight labor budgets created labor shortages once someone called out, and they called out often because the environment was so stressful."
bad,"Great money- but you work a lot and don't get any support. Upper level turnover is crazy- 9 Area Directors in 5 years.Many hand shake promises that never got satisfied. Never given a ""good job"" or ""thanks""."
bad,at first I really enjoyed this job and what I was doing. but now I hate everything about chilis and their business. management sucks. they don't know who to hire. you come in for you qa shift and end up cooking and not leaving til 3 am !! its just so much wrong.
bad,"They HIre anyone of the streets pretty much and stick them in the kitchen. I worked next to a guy working on deep fryer who was greasier then the fryer. Ate food that fell on floor or would make extra for himself. They didnt use cleaner for the floors, just poured hot water on the floor and squigied the water into a drain. Leaving it greasy and slippery. Rarely had the kitchen Clean and the staff Joked around more then they worked. I personally will not eat there because of the things ive experienced there. Its wrong to put down a place, but im warning fellow customers or employees."
bad,"I have never worked for such an awful restaurant. The food is disgusting, the cleanliness of the kitchen is absolutely appalling.The majority of the time the other employees will want someone to cover them, however as soon as you need a shift covered they are no where to be found, the management for the most part does a good job, with the acceptation that  even when you give them in writing that you are unavailable they will most of the time still schedule you and then proceed to blame you for not updating your availability on their scheduling application."
bad,Being white in a Hispanic dominated kitchen is tough already then you have a Hispanic kitchen manager belitting you. No lunch breaks when you work 8+ hours a day!
bad,"This restaurant is going downhill, and going fast. Continued lowering of wages, losing long lasting AND new employees, and management is at an all time low."
bad,Very hostile and unorganized and unprofessional some manager had no respect for their employees and sometimes the customers and they tried to cheat you out of what you deserve pay wise
bad,They do not make minorities comfortable.  I did not like working there.  Company does not care about it's employees.  They are not truthful about a lot of things.
bad,management is terrible. Always running out of stuff and just overall terrible environment. You do make a lot of good friends working there. I don’t recommend it.
bad,horrible director of operations;  the general manager allowed staff do to whatever they want and the director of operations and him are good friends;  the place has lost its culture of service.
bad,chilis is a great place for money but way to stressful in no matter what position you work. Company only cares about money and labor hours used. Sometimes it cares about the staff but that includes if you are some ones favorite. Worked there for a month shy of 11 years and dont know why i stayed so long
bad,"Training restaurant was phenomenal. A field of dreams type place. My home restaurant was not so welcoming or operationally sound. You begin a usual shift by performing a written or visual line check. You make sure the next shift is set up for success by restocking and properly staffing and controlling the flow of operations. "
bad,I worked at chili’s in Durham across from Southpoint mall management was Disgusting. I was wrongfully fried with no valid reason. They pop pills and yell at you all night. It’s a very uncomfortable job site. Tips n customers are not that bad at all I may have had 1 unsatisfied guess on my behalf but like 10 due to the kitchen not cooking the food all the way. I was kicked out the store a forced to stand in the cold and wait 1hr and a half for a locksmith
bad,"I worked in this restaurant but they are very racist the day I started until the day I leave everyday."
bad,Better organization need more leadership need to clean a lot more no control over the employees acknowledged they're working little more supervise better
bad,"It was a fast paced environment. Most of the managers were really nice, and did their job very well. However, the part time workers made it difficult to work."
bad,"Chilis was a very busy high paced working environment. The money was good for the most part working there. It was the management that made chilis unbearable to work for. They lacked appreciation and support , never acknowledge your hard work , always mad and cranky and snappy. The management team down talked and always made you feel stressed and depressed."
bad,"This is seriously the worst restaurant that i have ever worked for in my 15 year career. For some reason good management is hard to find and dependable employees that are competent are even harder. If you are scheduled a double you didn't ask for, you are now working an open to close with no break."
bad,Chili's culture was not the Brand that I was custom to. Lack of leadership at this location needed much help. General Manager was in direct competition with other managers.  The do not have an development plan for Managers.
bad,this was just a place to cost in between jobs not wanting to stay home but needed to  keep busy until a better job comes along. you get free food for your lunch break
bad,This company does not care about food quality or taking care of guests. They are more concerned with cutting labor and food costs. I was embarrassed to work for Brinker.
bad,"It is tough working for a company who's sole goal is saving money and not about its workers who sacrifice so much and receive so little. Dig deeper. And show a little more compassion and understanding to your workers and understand ""numbers"" from the ziosk do not always accurately reflect a guests experience nor should it dictate a person's schedule."
bad,"The work environment is inconsistent and unstable"
bad,"This is your typical first part-time job. Poor and inconsistent hours, no benefits, high stress levels. Everyone is out for themselves, and sometimes you don't even get a break between shifts."
bad,Good work place. Not the place for me. Would rather not speak of my indifferences or my opinion on my experience of working there.  I am grateful that they gave me the opportunity to work there. It is just not the work atmosphere for my liking.
bad,"management was cut throat and biased. even after I wrote HR I was fired as a directive impression to keep staff inline. management was biased, the had no problem taking you off the schedule to retaliate against you, HR was obsolete, and didn't matter on personal performance played favorites regardless"
bad,HORRIBLE Management!!! I have never met a more disrespectful and down right terrible manager. There is only one manager here that I do not ever wish anyone to work for.
bad,This place has been on a downward slope for years with their best employees leaving and a shrinking budget for staff. Their sales are falling year after year and the new CEO seems content with the status quo. I left this job last week.
bad,"I am a young server recently hired at a new store and while my coworkers are great the management constantly makes sexist remarks and make it clear that the only reason they keep me is because I am attractive. They are downright cruel and unfair to the veteran employees who I admit are far better at their jobs than any of the new people, including myself.  They over-hired for this store and the management is clearly lost.  I will be looking for more mature management during my job search"
bad,"While I worked here, I experienced some really bad things. First of all, I was not scheduled for an entire week. as a matter of fact, when I called, I was told that they had forgotten I worked there. Secondly, after I quit, it took them a month and a half to give me my last paycheck, and I was not payed for the first five days that I worked. I do not wish to work here again, although I have heard that they are under new management and they are doing much better,"
bad,Great flexible hours as any restaurant has to offer. You will be over worked doing more than just your job description. Management in the specific location I was in was extremely poor.
bad,"One of the worse working experiences of my life. Not flexible at all with you yet they expect you to be flexible with them. No real management, sort of a do what you want type of atmosphere. If you don't do anything you get everything handed to you but if you work your butt off its going to stay off."
bad,It is waiting tables for a chain restaurant. No independence with constant scrutiny on everything you do.
bad,"When I started at this establishment I was thrilled.  Guaranteed hours at a decent starting wage and the promise to grow.  The first few years were quite the experience.  I learned a lot, met a lot of really amazing people and worked very hard.  My general day consisted of the typical cooking procedures and cleaning in a fast paced environment.  We had a switch in management and lost several employees.  The new general manager ran the restaurant successfully except in one important area...dealing with an enormous amount of harassment.  I was bullied emotionally and physically at times.  The events that occurred there were completely ridiculous and shameful.  In NO OTHER profession is this form of behavior tolerated, but at Chili's...it was almost encouraged and laughed upon daily.  I took my job very seriously, while most of my co-workers were careless.  Overall my job was hard in the aspect of working at times very long hours with no breaks...being mistreated and eventually dealing with illegal actions on their part.  I do miss the few co-workers I had met who seemed to keep the restaurant afloat.  For that Chili's was lucky.  I would never recommend anyone work there.  "
bad,"Chili's made all kinds of promises to me about new store openings and room for advancement. I left a job that I enjoyed a lot with much better work environment thinking Chili's was going to offer me room for advancement. They hired 16 managers ahead of time before they opened 6 new stores the next year. When they could not afford to open the stores, they laid off 16 managers and 2 district managers. The worst part was that they did not want to pay unemployment, so they lied on the managers and said they were fired for ""work performance"". This was not true, in my case. I worked there for 1 1/2 years, received a raise since I had been there, and had not received even one write up for job performance. I was told the District Manager was coming in, to make sure the store looked great for him. I worked diligently all day to make the store perfect He did not even look at the store. He came in 9 hours into my 10 hour shift, and fired me for job performance. Then he treated me like a common criminal and had to escort me to the office to get my belongings. I have never been so embarrassed in my life!! I am also losing my house thanks to the loss of income from Chili's. I should have stayed at my prior job. There wasn't much room for advancement, but the job was secure and I actually enjoyed going to work....."
bad,"Some good managers, but promises of benefits & income fall flat. Long hours, little money, no breaks. With their competitively priced menu, & sauced up fast food, along with middle class clientele looking to save a buck, tips are low. You work your tail off to barely make any money. I averaged around $9 an hour! That's pitiful! Plus, they are a corporate restaurant, so they have their little spiel you must say, & all their little puppet tricks you must do!! Forget being an individual! Overall, if you want to be worked to death for no money & underappreciated, because everyone knows that hard work is rewarded by more chores in the restaurant industry. Also, their corporate owners perform ""mystery shops"" & in the few months I worked there I actually observed 3 great people get fired because of this ridiculous gimmick. All because they didn't say their little spiel correctly!! If you decide to work here, get ready to have corporate shoved down your throat!!"
bad,After a while employees start trying to get you fired or sexually harass you. Management picks their favorites to give the best sections to and make bartenders. I have been followed by a cook late at night and they acted like it was nothing. Dirty environment. Guests always getting sick in the bathroom.
bad,"They pay you good, but that's about it, other cooks on the line will treat you like garbage, and steal your items from your bag/coat on the hooks in the back. Management will leave you with a malfunctioning computer at your station with no prep done; a station void of any ingredients, chicken still frozen and expect you to contend with all of this and attempt to train a new employee aswell all on a Friday night at peak business hours. This was my second time working here I originally quit when items were stolen from me and I quit again after this Friday night incident. The place is in desperate need of new management. When I first worked their Prep wasn't always done but the second time was apalling."
bad,Very unorganized and managers are very unprofessional.  Place needs alot of help. To much favoritism so any new employee stands no chance of you ask for help people put you down. Not a fun place to work.
bad,Chili’s is by far the worst job I have ever worked due to upper management! The company’s district managers are mad with power and only care about how they see you as a employee
bad,"GM has no clue how to run the store. Always out of products. GM likes to stand around and flirt with servers and host. Never given your out time. Managers try to keep that a secret. Once you clock in, you are there till a manager tells you that you can leave. Very hard to make plans or appts when you dont know what time your getting off work"
bad,"I found many instances where the ""culture"" was not only disregarded but those who disregarded were promoted."
bad,Needs new management really bad. Almost always out of something. If you are not one of the mangers favorites they will be rude and your hours will usually be cut. Managers also talk bad about Team Members to other Team Members. Managers have so many complaints on them im not sure how they have their job.
bad,Wer von früh bis spät für Mindestlohn angemeldet sein will für denjenigen ist es der richtige Job. Wird viel schwarz ausbezahlt und auf dieses Geld muss auch lange gewartet werden. Oft bis zu drei Wochen. Den höchsten Chef habe ich nur bei Neueröffnung gesehen ansonsten unerreichbar.
bad,"My local chilis is a franchise. Our franchise used to be great. If it weren't for decent management and liking my coworkers, I would have left sooner.  They have taken away our bonuses, there are no benefits, the health care you can sign up for is just bad, and they are pandering to the lowest of the low clientele.  $10 meal deals means less money in the servers pockets, more running around bc it's a coursed deal, and high ticket times. Moral has consistently gone down, and managers openly talk about wanting to leave the company bc it's so terrible.  If you work for a chilis.. do not work for franchise"
bad,I worked so hard and long hours and gave up my life. My work was not appreciated and it wasn’t worth the money. The upper management wasn’t helpful and the culture sucked.
bad,A typical day is long and stressful. I learned a lot about management and restaurants in general during my time here. Management is inconsistent and I can attest to that as I am a manager and see it in my peers. Workplace culture is trash. The audio doesn't match the video. You never get to see your family. Too many hours and expectations. Awful company.
bad,This was a very bad place to work.Management is the worst Ive ever seen.Dont waste your time.There is a lot of drama and favortism here and a lot of unprofessional managers that will set you up
bad,"I was a very dedicated and strong employee for chili's bar and grill. I was loyal, worked shifts to help managers, partook in events, and other things involving chili's. New management did not treat the staff appropriately or professionally. There was a lot of compettition for shifts, the survies required to have in order to keep your job or threaten it is very stressful when you work part time and have a full career on the side. The management can say cuss words, do drugs, or say ugly things that are unnecessary to provoke staff or employees."
bad,"Favoritism is a strong point with management, and as a person who holds work ethic to be of top priority, it is a shame to see the slack other employees would get in comparison to the work I have put into the place over the past couple of years. Front of house is very lazy, and kitchen staff were not properly running the line as it needed to be for safe serving. Health inspections were a mess, as when the inspector would come around, that would be the only hour the managers drilled cleaning into the staff. Not all, but a lot of the employees are ""catty"", and I've experienced more than enough harassment to know any reports made were not taken serious. The employees basically lie to the quaint town about how the business is ran, however because it is a corporate chain and tourist are familiar with it, it still stands despite how poorly staff is treated and treat one another. One star, as this business has no ounce of quality to it's professionalism as a ""family restaurant""."
bad,The people I worked with as coworkers I loved to death and still keep in contact with. My managers on the other had were incapable of doing their jobs and so the rest of the restaurant felt that all the way to the customers.
bad,"I worked for chili's for over 2 years and it took that long to be trained  to serve even tho i wad promised at hire to be trained to serve within the first year and my primary job would be Q/A. After two years of solid employment without attendance issues and correctly doing every job that i learned, i was finally trained  to serve. Once serving i asked to do that full time and was told that it was a possibility. Within a couple of weeks all of my server shifts were pulled but 1 every two weeks or so. I was strictly scheduled in the Q/A window. After 2 years of lies and watching new employees advancing to higher positions simply because nobody could run the window like i could, i quit. In two years my dedication was never rewarded with a raise or better position. I went above and beyond what was even necessary for my position and felt like i was an asset to the company and was given absolutely no appreciation. I wasn't the boss' favorite and didn't kiss anyone's tush so i got nowhere. If i was ever to work at a chili's again, it won't be in my hometown and I'll never work for the management that they had at the time."
bad,"when i first worked here, it was great. but a couple weeks in it got horrible. none of the employees got along. the management sucked. managers would talk about the employees to other employees. they weren't flexible about hours. it was a horrible experience.."
bad,"Chili's was my first job, so it is really hard to compare this with anything else. I had fun there, the people were great to work with, we were like a little family."
bad,"The company itself has  a great life/work balance plan, good benefits, fun meetings out of town and such, however this particular branch is owned by a selfish, non-caring General Manager. She cuts hours, pay, set people up and frames them. I personally have also seen a lot of health code violations and unlawful termination practices."
bad,"They suck simple as that.. managment is horrible, employees there sucks with their bad attitude and talking horrible about each other. If you dont have drama or bs going on in your life then dont work here.. if you are backstabbing and two faced then WELCOME HOME!!"
bad,"When I worked here I was not treated the way that they say they treat their employees, I was often placed in section that didn't make money and was waiting a lot of big parties at a time with little to no help. The managers wouldn't care how well you did unless you cost them money which is the only thing they care about. You couldn't trust co-workers because they were always talking about you or other people behind their backs. A manager also told me during a panic attack that I had to suck it up because life sucks and everyone has to deal with it, this was not good for my mental health. Overall it's not a good environment to work in."
bad,"Have a lot to say about my experience working at Chili’s. Unless you’ve been an employee since the location opened (exaggeration), you will not be treated with the same amount of respect. There are a handful of servers/bartenders who have set schedules and get away with pretty much anything. Management is horrible and over looks everything they do. It’s very frustrating. They get all the “money shifts” and  no one ever gets the opportunity to work those shifts becauE the same people get them every week. So the “others” get all the side work and make the least amount of money. An over all mess and managers here will never stop playing favoritism."
bad,Very poor management and too much stealing and not enough recognition. I will never eat here again because of the things I've seen working here. Just foul!
bad,"Not much else to say here. Corporate food service work is never a fun or inviting atmosphere. The management was severely lacking, and the quality of people hired in was also sub par."
bad,"They work you to the bone and don’t appreciate you as a person at all.management is absolutely horrible, no one knows what they are doing at all. you are better working at McDonald’s.stay away!"
bad,"Poor management, feel like they pick favorites. Also the company just expects you to do so much for little pay.. blames everything on you when it has to do with their lack of help. Very unorganized. If you can find better, do so. Pros..Flexible for work/home life."
bad,"was very fun to work at until the PC police showed up, and they started to micromanage every single thing we did. numbers became more important than anything else, and if you don't perform start shopping your resume quickly."
bad,"So I worked at Chilis for less than a month. I have never stayed at that job for that short of a time. After less than I month, I began having panic attacks before work because it was so horrible and I dreaded going in ever single night. I worked the night shifts, 6 to close, so I was there anywhere between midnight to 1:30 in the morning. The hours were horrible, but because I was new, I didn’t have choice. One week I was extremely ill, so I messaged both of my managers to ask for the following day off (it is policy at Chilis to give over 24 hour notice), but no manager even answered me until 2 hours before my shift was supposed to start the next day. So for almost 24 hours, I was super sick, and then panicking that I would have to go in since no one would even answer me to authorize me to take off. Then there’s the customers. You get all types of people at Chilis, and with the 3 for 10 deal (which includes a drink, appetizer, and entree for only $10), it’s super affordable, which means SUPER LOW TIPS. If you’re lucky enough to get a tip, that is. Chilis does not allow servers to add gratuity to large tables, and it is not rare for tables to stiff you at Chilis, so you can bust your butt for a table of 12 people and walk away with nothing. But the managers don’t care of do anything to change it (i.e.: allow servers to add gratuity to large tables of 8 or more). And the customers that come are RUDE. I had a person wait 2 minutes for ranch once when I had a FULL section of 6 tables at the same time, and they flipped out and asked to speak to the manager. Over ranch. They acted"
bad,"I have been in the workforce for the last 13 years, and have never received a write up, or let alone been fired from a job before. In my three year career with Chili's I was written up 6 times for stupid stuff, and then fired twice for more ridiculous stuff as in 1 guest complaint."
bad,Working for Chilis was a beat down.  They cared more about the labor hours than the customers coming in the front door.  I spent more time bussing tables then I did talking to guest.  I would not recommend this job to anyone.
bad,All about saving on labor with the end result of un happy employees long food times unsatisfied patrons. They care more about profit then anything else.
bad,"I worked here for barely a few days, and they couldn't even tell me when I should be into work until hours before hand! This is the Manchester, CT location. They had numerous customer complaints and many people not having to pay for their meals. This is no fault of the staffs but the poor management. I think they would have done better by not hiring until they fixed their GM situation. I left my old job and was promised basically full time hours, so when I couldn't deal with the instability, I was left jobless for months. Don't work here if you need stability."
bad,"get it in writing. because they will go back on what suits them. the pay is good, the quality of life statement isn't followed at all! unless you are the GM"
bad,"Every time we ran out of something, it would take them weeks to order it and have it back on the menu. They even told us to make out own pickles because they weren't going to buy anymore. my co-workers had a better relationship with the managers so whenever they said something about how i didn't do what they wanted, the managers told me to get away from the hostess desk and go to the to-go desk so i didn't bother the servers anymore without asking me my side."
bad,"Had a GM that was unwilling to develop talent. This company rules on fear other than lifting you up with your strengths, you are beaten down by your faults. You are expendable and they don't care how it affects you. Not a humane environment."
bad,"Acquired this job early this year (2014), I did everything above-average, received more tips as a host than any other host working at the establishment. About a week ago I had the flu, and a stomach virus, I had to call out because of doctors orders....I was fired because I had to take too many days off although I had a printed and signed doctors note legitimizing my ailment and proving I was actually sick. Three managers a few days prior told me to bring my doctors note and I'd be fine, and then I called to check my next scheduled day, and was told the complete opposite by one of the other managers saying I would be separated from the company. If that isn't horrible management and unjust separation from a company than I don't know what is. Coworkers gossip and talk about other employees behind their back, and managers allowed a coworker to steal my skateboard out of the break room without checking the tape to see who stole it, when I told the managers, I was told by the two managers present, ""what am I supposed to do about that?"". I'm a student-worker at Cal State University Northridge, and I know wrong from right, this restaurant was wrong in more situations than right."
bad,Chilis offered nothing new just another job like the rest. somewhat ok pay for something on the side co workers mangers etc. long boring hours and a constant reminder of how childlike adults can behave.
bad,"Always do the bare minimum of your job , no matter how hard you try management only care about themselves and quarterly bonuses. Raises are supposed to be every 6 months for a review,  that will only happen if management and district manager bonuses are decent."
bad,"I was promoted from within the company over several years of employment with the goal of becoming a manager. To be successful you have to be fully committed to the job, which means being plugged into the situations occurring at the store on off-days and from store opening to closing. The ability to un-plug and not constantly be thinking about work is very difficult, and the hours involved in the location itself require this job to be your main commitment in life. It has its rewarding moments, and the pay is fair, but time committed is enormous and almost impossible to measure."
bad,"I got hired on, but never made it to my first day because the interview at the location I was at was so sketchy. I went I for an interview that I had scheduled online with them only to find out that they had no idea about it. Then when they finally printed off my resume they started asking me if I had kids, if I was going to have kids, if I was married and how many kids I had. Nothing that was actuallyrequired for the job. I got hired, but didn't feel comfortable working in a place that made me feel so u uncomfortable."
bad,"Completely understaffed. Employees are allowed to leave before their work is done. The ones with good ethic end up torturing themselves by picking up all the slack and trying to accomplish impossible tasks. Managers aren't even able to manage because upper management doesn't allow them to schedule enough people for the labor required. They have to wash dishes, prep, and cook on the line constantly. Nobody is held accountable for their actions and complaints go unprocessed. Raises are yearly and minimal. Hosts are poorly trained, so there's no realistic pace. The kitchen is slammed all at once while being pressured for ticket times which are impossible to meet. Work conditions are horrible because of labor cuts. For anyone who's worked in an efficient kitchen Chili's is a farce."
bad,"I was hired on the spot by a former manager, while the restaurant was in the process of getting a new GM. Did all of my On-Boarding while waiting for orientation. During that time, the manager that hired me quit. I repeatedly called about orientation and was given the run around by another female manager. Later, I found out that the new GM was a former manager of mine from another restaurant; we did not get along. Needless to say, I never had orientation. Good thing, I never hadn't quit my job; and that GM didn't stay with the company."
bad,"This place can be fun, but managment changed all the time and you never knew what you were going to get. They dont really appreciate an individual's work or achievement unless you are on of their ""favorites"". You have to work really hard to make money when the company has deals that make meals start at $7."
bad,The managers were new and inexperienced i was the lowest paid employee making executive decisions and training others. I never got to take a lunch because they made us waive our lunch breaks.
bad,The managers at this restaurant are not only incompetent but vindictive and masochistic. There is virtually no loyalty to those who have been employed with them for many years. It is worse than a poorly run high school. It may be singular to the location in Sheridan but it is unlikely
bad,In the location i worked in was bad management. Boss got fired for harassment. Food is good can get along with other co workers . Can be a chill fun place at times.
bad,Chilis is an alright establishment to have employment in but there are many things that are wrong with the restaurant. The first thing is we never got the raise we were told about. The second thing is that you didnt have any way of moving up in the company.
bad,"Management sucks! General manager trying to weed out everyone thats not his race. Won't work with you when in need of help. Management mentality... ""I'll just fire you and find someone else."" when you have a complaint, don't call the area director, he won't return you're calls. And human resources takes too long to get back with you."
bad,The company itself has great intentions for their employees however this particular licatiin due to poor management was provided a terrible work exoeruence. Money waz great ti be made but staffing and responsibility was poor reflecting my job everyday. Management was impossible to talk to and training was nit conducted properly
bad,"Typical day at work depends all on the day and work flow. I learned how to manage a store. management was okay I loved some of my managers. It was a very diverse place all kinds of cultures there.  um Dish pit cause the servers had no training how to properly stack, throw, and maintain the dish pit. The most enjoyable was becoming a family for the job."
bad,"Very caddy group of people which including the mangers. "
bad,Unorganized no reliable workers bad managers just the worst chilis u could possibly work at. Ive worked there for 3 years trust me. The only thing they care about is themselves.
bad,I hated the job the process the managers the crew the whole place they disnt give enough ours and it was so stressful its a horrible postion i would never work here ever
bad,"Everything there was just bad! The service, management, and food. The team members wouldn’t work together at all! As they hired people they would quit their first day or the same day!"
bad,"If you are a character that can stay in the back and show up then Chilis will make you feel used. They will under cut your hours, your pay and the management will work against you not with you."
bad,"Chili's doesn't care about employees. It doesn't matter how hard you work or how well you perform, it doesn't get you anywhere. They will pay a new hire employee more than employees that have been with the company for years."
bad,The managers needed to have more hands on help rather than barking at employees constantly. They had there favorites and It showed greatly each shift on who they preferred
bad,Chili's brand is falling everyday and the daily casual dinning. The company is cheap and keeps putting more workload on great team members and management .
bad,while i worked at chilis i hated it. the managers were horrible. the crew was horrible & messy. everyone was rude & unprofessional at the job on the clock.
bad,Very faced paced. Managers not really qualified for their positions. Many do not care about the employees. Can make good money if you are young and still in school. But lots of work.
bad,Chili's is a good start to restaurant/hospitality career. They hire with no experience and you get a good hard glimpse of the industry. You will learn where you don't want to be very quickly.
bad,"Slow and fast "
bad,Need to be able to suck up to customers in order to get a good tip. Pay for servers is unfair to begin with. Hours at this job were hard to get because the current employees were the ones to get them all.
bad,They were really great at first but after a while the boss was being very rude to me and wrote me up because I had the flu and could not make it to work
bad,Looking to improve my career with better job to achieve  more goals in my life independ on what experience  I have with full of respect to my current company.
bad,too much work for too little pay not disrespectful but sometimes it happens they want you to know everything before you start
bad,"The managers here were aweful. They always side with the customers regardless of what happened and go to the extreme with punishment. The only exception to the managers is Ed. He's the bomb. They threaten you with your hours, the people that work there act like children and if they don't like you they'll find a way to get you fired. All of my friends there are looking to transfer to a nicer chilis."
bad,"Very dysfunctional environment. Inattentive management. Disrespectful coworkers. Hiring manager guaranteed many incentives and positive qualities about this job. Chili's followed through on none of these guarantees, including an agreed upon bare minimum of 10 hours a week."
bad,The managers when i worked here were awful. The one I did like left about a month after I started. Everyone that has been there a while seem to have a power trip and set schedules so any new comers cant get the sections they want nor deserve.
bad,Amateur level service.  High volume for less money than I would like to make.
bad,"horrible management, and they treat you like trash. did not have a good experience there at all"
bad,"I was hired, and a month later became pregnant.  When they found this out, they cut my hours to 5 hours a week (1 day) because I was a ""liability."""
bad,"A typical day was fast paced with a quick table turn over.  I was able to advance my customer service skills.  Management was always changing and the employees were typically a mess. The hardest part of the job were the various personalities and over indulgent customers that demanded more than corporate would allow in some cases.  The ""regulars"" sometimes took on the attitude that it was their restaurant, not Chili's corporation. Management was not supportive of the employee.  Management saw the employee as the ""bad guy"" and was typically distrustful of the employees.  The money was decent.    "
bad,"I enjoyed prep work for chilis, washing dishes was straight forward and simple, My co-workers where dependable and and reliable, only issue was the mangement refused to work with my schooling schedule. Corporate refused to assist me as well. Unfortunatley that was the hardest part of my job, I had to leave class many times to maintain employment."
bad,"This was a hard job. You don't get breaks, you are extremely over worked. I loved my managers. I wanted to stay for them but physically couldn't. I was extremely sore every day and exausted. This is the busiest restaurant in forest city. Probably worth it as a server but as a cook it is not stop and you get destroyed. Miss working in a kitchen."
bad,"It had its pros and cons just like every job. But this location was a great opportunity for me to use my social skills. Overall, it was a great company to work for, just when an issue came up. It was never looked into"
bad,Been working for chilis for 4 years. The last 2 years was upsetting ever since we gotten a new general manager and table entertainments. Company started to rank servers by scores from table entertainment. Managers was toying with peoples schedules and new crew members was not train correctly
bad,"Management is the worst at this restaurant, it’s a very fast paced environment and they do nothing to help. They have bugs and rats everywhere and don’t do anything to clean up the restaurant."
bad,Management is poor and they hire felons who went to jail for domestic violence or drugs  and they get all the hours and considerations  many people who eat here do not tip you either  you do not make the money that is possible because there is no automatic gratuity for large parties and you get no tips
bad,They don’t care if you are sick or on your death bed they want you to come to work. The people who come don’t tip even if you give them the best customer service experience. Only perk if you get 50 percent off food
bad,Terrible place to work cause it isnt able to flow as a business or a backbone.  its as if all the bones were shattered and are still missing so they dont know how to collaborate as a whole. I am a head prep cook yet part time as an individual yet they gave me full time hrs with overtime and out of no where after months of assimilation to the pay cut me to less than 15 hrs a week. I am currently seeking employment elsewhere cause of this.
bad,"Lack of communication between management and staff. Certain hours/shifts are promised but rarely given. Shifts are generally busy/high paced but the lack of communication and organization made shifts draining. Not having enough cooks or under-trained cooks lead to food being made incorrectly regularly which means unhappy customers, which also means low/no tip"
bad,"Well it started okay, but I was in school at the time. They were not flexible with my hours. I ended up calling out one time because I had strep throat and they took me completely off the schedule. It was terrible management they were perverts."
bad,it was a great place to work. it took me from nothing to something. what a fantastic place to work. i learned so much there. i developed manager skills.
bad,"Things not done right to save money. General manager reaping the benefits for other people hard work. Low pay, and they try their best to keep it that way."
bad,Management do not hold everyone to the same standard so working hard for you isnt the same as working hard for someone else. Raises are nearly impossible to gain and management are chasing that bonus every quarter to the point of giving kitchen workers only 20 to 25 hours.
bad,My years with the company wasn’t all bad! Over the last couple years the company went down! I loved being apart of the team that I worked with is reason I stayed as long as I  did.
bad,Had problems with manager at the time. Customers could complain about a paper cut and manager would still comp their entire meal. The workplace is fast pace. No enjoyable part of the days. The hardest part of the day was dealing with said manager and lazy co workers.
bad,"There aren't words to describe how archaic this company is. No wonder the food is subpar and Chili's is relying on their familiarity with customers to keep its' business still going. I worked for 3 years starting out as a server and eventually became a bartender. You not only are responsible for the guest's service but their perception of Chili's. If they think the bathroom isn't clean enough, or the food isn't hot enough, Chili's makes it YOUR fault. you are rated by the appearance of that location, or how the host treated them, or if a manager is visible or not. As a customer service guru I was able to build a huge clientele and build sales 800%-that went unappreciated and unrecognized. I do not recommend working for this company, nor will I ever spend a dime on this company. Their corporate culture is void, and their to protect Chili's-not its employees."
bad,"the managers play favorites, youre treated very unfairly if you have an issue and they dont seem to care if you need help. i will never reccomend working here again."
bad,i would go in and wait on tables clean if needed the manager was not a good manager he didnt help if you asked any question they would not help you some of the people i miss
bad,"liked job, good customers, co workers negative, managers did not give me a tour in training, managers also did not give me good amount of hours which lead me to quit and move."
bad,They do not care about there employees and will work you to death. I had a manager tell me that I was being lazy when I had 9 different tables to myself.
bad,"There was a new manager every other month. They made me take out my nose hoop and fired people for their hair color changes, so as long as you don't mind covering tattoos, piercings, etc., then you won't have to worry about that. The hours were very wishy-washy; sometimes I'd work four days a week, sometimes I'd get no hours for two weeks. As a hostess, you make around $5-$6 plus tips. It's not much money at all, especially for the little amount of hours."
bad,The overall experience of the staff they hire is way below the standards they have set for the company. Team members are always overwhelmed trying to meet ticket times/ sales quotas. 12 to 14 hours a day was very invasive on family life. Although I was able to pick up some new management ideas and computer skills. It was rewarding when a team member was able to break thru and succeed.
bad,"chilis overworked me, barely gave time off, management was awful. you could be fired for breathing, it was a dirty restaurant, the cooks were obnoxious"
bad,I have never worked in a restaurant that was so dysfunctional. No one wanted to be there staff or management. This restaurant was the dirtiest I have seen.
bad,"this company starts off looking good but in the end you don't get opportunities to advance, getting time off is like getting a tooth pulled and if your a hard worker you can definitely forget about being what you want to be when you get to hopefully advance, slackers get the rewards"
bad,Working at chili's was not a very pleasant experience for me. They have large shared sections (two servers for fifteen tables) that are usually very unorganized and a nightmare to deal with on a busy day. Ridiculous surveys that servers are required to get 5 stars on (if you get a 4 it counts as a zero) that affect your scheduling and employment and they are constantly running out of products like hamburger patties and buns. The management team was unorganized and the team members had little pride in their jobs.
bad,I was over worked and under paid. I transferred from another state to the Winchester location. I was working literally 60+ hours a week. I filled every whole in their schedule for 2 months straight with 3 days off max per a month. I would sometimes be asked to work from open to close. I did all this no questions asks. I transferred with the same pay I started with. When I approached the store manager about a 50 cent raise I was given every excuse as to why I wasn't going to get a raised. I rightfully earned the $0.50 raise I was asking for since I had been with the company more than a year and I literally saved this location from drowning. I gave up my family life with my 5 year old daughter to give every minute I had to this company and I received a spit in the face. The cleanliness of this business was horrific. Bugs were a huge problem in the kitchen. A problem that never seemed to get fixed.
bad,They would randomly take people off the schedule on the day of their shift. Never had a guarantee that by 2 hours before work that I'd even still have a shift. Managers seem to think that they're entitled and better than anyone else. They never show their employees respect. And i didn't have a decent base pay so keeping my bills paid is nearly impossible.
bad,"I enjoyed working with my fellow employees. I worked long hours and business was slow. I worked doubles and did cleaning, cooking handling complaints, took orders, and delivered food."
bad,"Good job when you first start, not a good job if your relying on it to pay bills as a server. Bartenders make the most, but takes a lot of experience to be able to obtain the position.  Training store with not enough strict boundaries."
bad,I really do not have much to say about this company other than organization wasn't a priority to the restaurant I was employed. I do however believe it is not an issue company wide. I believe this particular restaurant had to many changes in management to have the ability to function correctly
bad,"I really didn't mind this job, but wish not to do it again. Don't really like the idea of being in a kitchen. "
bad,"I loved working here but the management is so messed up that I had often thought about quitting. They fired me because I had to walk for 44th and kipling to 1st and wads and said I did a no call no show when I was trying to find some one to cover my shift and I had a ride on its way. They didn't offer to send someone to get me which is what they would have done with anyone else they just told me not to come in and call them back later that day. The servers, cooks, bartenders, and everyone else that works there are amazing people and are the only reason I didn't quit sooner, them and the costumers. I worked here for a year and had formed relationships with the regulars that came in."
bad,"horrible place to work, very unsanitary place, slow production."
bad,I have nothing good to say about chili's except I love my coworkers. The management is no what i am used to working with. So i am in the process to find a new job
bad,"If you want a social life don’t work here. When you ask for a more flexible schedule they cut your hours to maybe 2 half shifts a week. Also, when they approve your requests off they will still schedule you to work and expect you to be there."
bad,I did what I could do for as long as I could but it just wasn't for me. I appreciate the opportunity and them letting me work there. If I had to work there again I would not work in the kitchen I would either be a server or work in the front of the house.
bad,Overall just stressful especially when they haven't given a raise to you in over 2 year's. They put too much on one person and expect greatness. If they would ask me to go back I would decline.
bad,No room for advancement. Got to be part of the club to get promoted to GM. They  dangle the carrot that is impossible to get. No MP leaves since they make good money.
bad,"i asked for part time but never knew when i was getting off, i worked about 8 hours a day almost everyday. manager yelled at everyone all the time and co workers weren't welcoming."
bad,At chili’s there are a lot of managers who have favorite people so they may get away and do a lot of things you shouldn’t be able to do it’s just a really stressful environment
bad,"The management was the worst part of the whole job. District manager used her feelings too much, played favorites as well. Other managers seemed to not care. They also don’t keep things private. They all gossip. So if you’re into that. Then this is the place for you."
bad,They don’t pay you enough for the work you do. They don’t appreciate the work you accomplish. They are very ungrateful and man there break their backs for the managers and to get noticed just for them to not even care.
bad,"Cut-throat kitchen and management all day.  Work is your life, with no life outside of work , for that reason people are always covering peoples shifts."
bad,Left company on good terms but before I left I found it getting more and more difficult. Servers required to bus tables seat guests and run food. When food comes out with issues it reflects on server's survey on the Kiosk placed on every table. Must be able to juggle 10 tables or more due to management not being able to staff more servers to keep money in investors hands for profit only. Guests experience doesn't matter to the company's higher ups.
bad,"Zero support , from D.O. always short on managers , not able to take days off, not able to take vacations, culture is at an all time low , to much shifting in upper management cause no alignment . they talk and promise so much but never deliver , the reason they can't hire and keep mgrs"
bad,"Chili's as a company itself does not have it's employees in mind as far as welfare goes. Whatever they can sell the cheapest to get people in the door is what they'll do. No sense of accomplishment in this job or rewarding behaviour. They expect you to walk the line and not question a thing, like the military. They never put you in the best spot to succeed. Management is always all over the place, never on the same page."
bad,"No matter how hard i tryed i  couldnt work hard or fast enough for the bosses to be happy about it. But, I was working myself ragged and still asking for more hours."
bad,"Experience and quality is not a forefront. I would not recommend anyone to this company, but maybe it was just the area?I could be wrong. This particular restaurant had very high turnover for servers and managers"
bad,A typical day at work consists of stressed management who expects you to do everything that the previous employees did not complete. I learned how to manage stress and continue doing what I do best under these circumstances. Management was inconsistent and had horrible communication with each other and employees. The hardest part of the job was maintaining motivation because of how much the job tore you down.
bad,Management is incredibly poor that plays favorites towards certain employees over others. The pay is not enough but it is nice to get 50% off your order when you are an employee.
bad,Managers are too nice and too many lazy employees take advantage of that. when your the only one doing your job you got to do everyone else's job as well.
bad,I worked there for two years. It was fun sometimes but when it not ran by good management- it becomes too stressful to work there. Serving is fun and worth the money.
bad,"They will schedule you outside of your ability and when you ask co-workers to cover shifts they are too lazy to cover them, forcing you to call out, leading you to be written up. If asking to work your way up they will start treating you in a negative way. Management makes you not want to work there anymore."
bad,"-too much drama, gossip"
bad,"Management was always rude and unable to accommodate required time off"
bad,the management staff is lazy. they dont care about their employees just the sales and money they can bring in. they over schedule everyone and are completely understaffed. but they dont care.
bad,The clientele were horrible!  When people came in they have zero respect for the staff.  If you are a bartender don't expect to make much money.  Go down the road to a restaurant that is not near that mall.
bad,"I was a host and had to bus everything by myself with no help and got zero tips, im doing two jobs and just got paid minimum wage. it was a joke, i was there for two years and didnt get moved up."
bad,I have worked for chilis for a couple years now and in 2 different locations and the lack of managment and care in the business is sad. They worry about little things at work but dont care if you show up.
bad,"Managers choose their favorites by who's the laziest and most talkative. These managers and employee's do not participate in a majority of kitchen duties required to run a clean, smooth operating kitchen."
bad,"No room for advancement"
bad,"Simple as that. Poor management with training, coaching, and following up job responsibilities. Truck orders are constantly missing things needed. The dishwashers can not clean dishes. The cooks are all b*tchy. The servers have too much attitude."
bad,Work here if you're married or a student. It's tough for someone to survive solely on this income. I made $87 all week last week. You get to eat a lot.
bad,I had a manger fired to sleeping his way through the servers. A customer got drunk and thought he could like his shot on fire... It literally blew up in his face.
bad,I was a cashier and hostess. Greeted customers and maintained a productive work place. Fast paced environment at Hartsfield- Jackson international airport.
bad,"Chilis gave me the oportunity to express my passion in cooking, but at the same time, challenged me to other positions in the store. My willingness to meet any need in this establishment, became an expectation from the management and staff with no regard to the quality of work I was delivering."
bad,Was good until they decided they wanted terrible servers that dont know what they are doing to get paid and that long term employees don't mean anything.
bad,"If you want to work here, be prepared for bad care as an employee and unfairness in the work place...as well as bad pay. You can get some regulars as servers and there are good days, but overall it is not a good environment to work in and there is not much upfront talking when you feel there is a need for it. If you want something done and you go to your boss about it, it will most likely not get done."
bad,My experience at chilis did not go well. I was promised 30-35 hours a week and ended up getting around 18 hours a week. Which were all weekend nights.
bad,"This is a company where everyone tries to act like ""a family"" but that is not the case. Management says they are ""fare"" but they are the farthest thing from it. They don't care about advancing anyones career. TIP: Don't get a hosting job here in hopes of becoming a server because it is a long process that is not even worth it. Wait until you are 18 and start as a server, that is where the money is."
bad,"If your work there, the money is great no doubt, but be ready to be accepted into one of the main cliques created and become a management favorite by being part of the clique. If you arent, you wont get a lot respect and they play favorites all the time. So you best believe you wont get the days off you want and you wont get the good sections either. Being in an environment like this makes you stressed out and uncomfortable which brings your performance numbers down."
bad,"I worked there while my wife served as she was in the military and it was the only american job available. Typical waiting job, nothing to go into detail about. Good learning experience."
bad,"I was a serve here as a teenager. 8 years later and Chilis is still paying servers 2.13 an hour with absolutely no raises. Management was awful and so was the pay. The chilis I worked at wasn't in the best area so even though you worked your butt off, people would still tip you 10% because they were cheap, and even if you cleaned off your own tables and didn't have any alcoholic drinks that night, you still had to tip out to the bus boy and bartender."
bad,"It is okay for your first job. You work 40 or more hours a week, Lunches are sometimes later than required by state. leads supervisors and managers have favorites. Schedule against availability. They do not care if you are sick or got in a car accident, They will write you up for being late or calling out for valid reasons."
bad,no room for growth. terrible hours. no benefits. no time off.
bad,Not my favorite place to work at.  Hard to deal with management.  They never wanted to listen to what you had to say. 
bad,"The managers didn't play fair, and they were very ugly to their employees."
bad,"Training is not very good and got terminated for taking a picture of a crazy bar guest that I felt unsafe at the workplace, felt like an outcast and unwelcomed because I was an outside hire!"
bad,"The management is terrible, coworkers are lazy, pay is good. This is not a place to work. Just because of the management. I’ll never work for this company again."
bad,"I had months where I had only 2 days off that I was told I could take as owed days in the future.  However, when Some of those owed days off are placed in as extra days off in a future schedule, ""your schedule does not meet the scheduling guideline requirements and must be changed.""  Basically your extra days off drops your schedule quality, so you can not have them."
bad,Not that good of an environment for work. Does not have good work flow and very inconsiderate of workers sometimes. Hard work is overlooked and favorites are chosen.
bad,"This job is terribly mind numbing. Basically you have to wait by the door for customers so that you can open it for them, seat them, and then listen to the servers complain about where you sat them. Some of the employees are genuinely good people, but most of them are extremely rude and feel the need to be involved in constant drama with other employees. They are almost always talking badly about other employees/customers in the back. The only thing I really enjoyed about working here is having small conversations with the customers from time to time. I left because I could no longer handle the hostility."
bad,"I feel like the managers don’t really care that much about what you have going on. The workplace is very clique like, I’m only scheduled 2 days a week and even on days where I’m not available due to school."
bad,"Some days are better than others, granted, however, I have had more bad days than good days. Everyday has its own struggles. Some people are able to work in the hectic weekends, but I can not."
bad,Never got a raise. Didn’t get tips like everyone else. BOH and servers would treat you like garbage. They would work you a lot or none at all. Overall just not worth working there
bad,"Here's a tip: If you're considering working here, don't. There are days where you can be working for 10 hours. During my time at Chili's a lunch break or typical 10 minute break was not provided. Tips are great. However, this job is stressful and does take a toll on you physically, and mentally. If you like to plan ahead, the schedule is posted one week in advance, not two weeks, and definitely not three weeks in advance."
bad,"It sucks, don't work here. They cut all your help and leave you to struggle through your shift. Management is poor and most workers feel attacked by them."
bad,"I would have to say it the worst restaurant i have ever worked for. there was always a problem when entering the building to come to work, weather it be in the kitchen or front of the house."
bad,Stay away. They are biased based on gender & ethnicity over skills. Hours vary as do shifts. Weekends are part of the schedule and nights are very busy
bad,It was ok but they didn't have the best management and they don't train you for your position either. It was also a very dirty work environment with rude co-workers.
bad,"As a manager it was clear that there was no respect or appreciation. You are welcome to come to work but not welcome to leave."
bad,A typical day at work was coming in early and leaving late. I learned stress. Management was terrible. Workplace culture sucked. Hardest part was stress. Enjoyable part was cheap food.
bad,"Customers are horrible. Corporate doesn’t care about their employees, they make the 3 for $10 thing and make your life harder. You take parties of 20+ and STILL have NO gratuity and half don’t even tip. Management is alright. Too many hours and even if you’re dying of sickness I’m sure they’ll call you in. They’ll probably call you to do jobs you didn’t even apply for. (Host, to-go, QA)"
bad,Working for this company is like working for any other restaurant company. Inconsistency in pay and hours. Did not drug test so dependable employees were hard to come by.
bad,"The continuous promos made it very hard to make any money. 3 for 10 , 2/22, and 2/1 allowed very low checks and poor tips from everyone around the spectrum."
bad,"Management only cares about ziosk numbers rather than the employee. If you get a low survey score they will try to replace you. No job security, managers often are rude with employees."
bad,"Coming from my first job being fast food, working here was a VERY high stress environment compared to so. Not good if you are new to multitasking. Managers were kinda creepy. Job was just overwhelming"
bad,"This job didn't pay much at all. Customers are usually rude and management treats staff as very disposable people. Good if youre a teenager, bad if youre an adult"
bad,"The general manager is terrible at his job. I would go into specifics but it would take far too much space. He is immature, humiliating, belittling, disrespectful, and comes into work with a terrible attitude. Not one person thinks highly of him, not even his fellow managers. I wish I had altered my course of where my first serving experience took place."
bad,"The people who worked there when i was employed were the ones who kept me going throughout the shift, managers were hard to work with, with that being said there were a few coworkers who were unbearable and when you'd report it to management they did nothing about it, the kitchen was a mess and the entire restaurant didn't flow as a restaurant should."
bad,"absolutely hated everything about working for this company."
bad,"a company that once held esteem in the restaurant industry is now on it's last legs.  "
bad,"A job for a person who lives with his o her parents and only has to pay for only clothing, mobile phone bill and really simple things. No more comments."
bad,"This place is terrible to work for, they don’t pay good enough and they are not good at giving hours evenly. they should allow you to take off some time when it is needed l."
bad,As a server what you made truly was all on your performance.  The biggest issue is the lack of motivation or even basic human concern the manager had on the staff.
bad,"A company that cares more about there ""secret shops"" than their long-term employees. I've seen chilis fire servers for failing to say the chilis word for word greet at a table. Servers who worked for the company for multiple years, working six days a week and doubles on doubles. Chilis doesn't respect their serving staff and only care about the money they are making and how to make the most by keeping everything cheap by not hiring cleaning staff for the nights and forcing the serving staff to clean and shut down the whole place and to also make desserts, soups and a deal with tables."
bad,Poor management that creates a hostile work environment.  If your looking for positive feedback from managers than you may look elsewhere.  They do not practice the culture they preach.
bad,"Typical day: clock in at 8 am and clock out at around 6pm, but still have to work off clock to finish job. Company requires too much and does not allow enough hours to get it done so have to regularly work off the clock to get it done."
bad,I couldn't the way i ended working at chillis it was bad tryed to leave respectively but got messed over dont want that to happen to anyone chillis is my least favorite restaurant to work for
bad,"Not a fan of General Managers talking down to employees, using vulgar language towards employees, threatening their employment because they don't bow down to him . I was fired because I didn't want to perform a duty that wasn't in my job criteria. Treated me very unfairly and as if I wee his personal slave."
bad,this store is franchise and the General Manager talks to you recklessly. The general manager has no soft skills and openly admits it. You work extremely hard and the general manager makes it extremely hard to advance in this company. The hardest part if the job is dealing with the HOH they curse at you and make derogatory statements all the time to you. The most enjoyable part of this job is the guest and talking to them before you have to go into the cutthroat back of the restaurant.
bad,"Greedy company that does not care at all about employees. They cannot find good management so pay terrible people a low amount of money, and poor management is rude to their employees."
bad,A good amount of poor management communication. Constant upper level management shifts. More concern with numbers and stock holders than lower level employees and guests or customers. Extremely difficult ability to receive raises. Constant lack of or access to supplies and materials needed.
bad,"This was my second job and by far my least favorite out of the three jobs I have had. I would go an entire double shift (11am- 10pm) without a single drop to drink because there always had to be a host at the stand and sometimes I would work all day by myself. I once had a break that was five minutes long, most of the time I only got 15 minutes when I worked doubles. The management was super kind to the hostesses but were extremely mean to the servers. The servers yelled at the managers quite a bit. The managers let servers yell at each other in the back, so tension was always felt when certain people had to work together or were in the same section. It was just a negative atmosphere, and I did not enjoy working there."
bad,"I just want to write a disclaimer here at the beginning that the reason everything was so awful at this Chili's is because it was operated and managed by Aramark. I haven't worked at a real Chili's, so for all I know they could be a amazing company. "
bad,"This place is not where you want to work. Can be stressful at times and mwas over you at any given second. Never forget you can be replaced at any moment of the shift. Worked there for three years, basically was the lead dishwasher. Worked Sunday through Friday for a while.  Then re-schedule for Monday through Thursday.  management was awful. Drought my three years have seen six managers leave/ fired.  And one GM burnt out from life at home and stressing with the restaurant. If you work in the kitchen watch your back. Old heads will return and try to get you removed from back there. If you are server or host. Find a new job. Old servers will keep their shifts and make more money than any new hire, same as bartenders. Favoritism is highly known in this business especially at Chilis if you have nothing else going for you and you like to kiss but. If you’re working And attending college. Chilis is really not the restaurant you want to work at. Same for seniors in high school.  Don’t make this a full-time job, or import time. Your sign in your life over to the devil. I’m not saying this because I’m not working there anymore I’m saying this because it’s true I’ve seen it all. You will be plotted on, and easy target, and somebody that everybody has to watch out if you speak your mind. Chilis CEO if you are reading this please control your employees and managers at every Chilis worldwide. Also GM’s and managers will change rules each and every day and at new rules as the shifts go on every day of every week of every month. I highly don’t recommend this job to anybody who wants to work"
bad,Bad management no authority managers do what that want the workers tell management what to do every shift I worked someone's quiting or no call no show hours they don't give u nothing but 30 a week work doubles check still the same wouldn't suggest to no one
bad,"Chilis was a fast paced restaurant somedays where you made good money, other days it was the slowest place in town where you'd leave as a server with less than 10 dollars, management couldn't schedule appropriately and couldn't make cuts accordingly, overall awful place to work"
bad,Learned how to manage money and customer service food handling. This is a good teenager job but not a long term job for sure. There was a lack of Management.
bad,I worked with chili's for almost two years and was illegally let go after deciding to attend Rehab. I didn't decide to sue them because i have family members that still work with the company. Management is horrible and often times made bad situations with guest worse. On a Friday night you were lucky to walk out with $100. They over staff and keep people on when the restaurant is dead. The GM is a big baby and shouldn't be the leader of anything especially a fast pace restaurant.
bad,There is no job security as they are coorporate restaurant full of robots. They do not care about their employees and will fire you at the drop of a hat with no warning.
bad,"there is no such thing as teamwork here, the management cares only for there numbers and not their co workers. You will be told one thing and get no results."
bad,The General manager at the location I was in lost her store. She panics under any stressful situation and losses her cool. poor leadership qualities. I do not believe in the brand anymore.
bad,a typical day at work is where i get to work around 9am clock in and work hard and be as productive as i can along with having fun and interacting with coworkers or customers. Also be respected and not under to much pressure while working and reaching 30min of break to eat and regroup. Then going back to work and continuing my duties that where assigned to me and finish the day around 4pm and getting enough hrs in and going home
bad,The restaurant scene in central philly differs wildly based on who you work with. It is difficult to anticipate what one work experience as one's co-workers will be nothing if not diverse.
bad,managers (at the time) we always tucked in their office and nearly impossible to talk to as tho you were inconveniencing them. and the pay was absolute garbage. prep got 8 a hour but cooks got 16. co workers didnt speak english and the best part of the day was the walk to the caqr or the free meal (off a limited list)
bad,"No breaks, you have to stand for 8 to 10 hours."
bad,"Head manager was great, but assistant manager was very unprofessional. He always made nasty racist and sexist remarks, other employees are very great kept promising raises never got one. You don't have to be good at your job if they like you they keep you."
bad,"I was very excited to start my journey as a ""chili head"" and at first it was great. But they expect u to entertain guests while the kitchen is behind (which is often!) I did not sign up to entertain I am a server not an entertainer! When the kitchen messes up the bosses grill you for it which I find ridiculous I have served for 8+ years and I have never seen kitchen staff as terrible as this one! Management well they were ok but some of them were more worried about flirting with employees than getting there job done which I find extremely unprofessional! Real quick to point out flaws of employees but terrible at looking at there own flaws made u wave your breaks when too busy which was annoying! over all this place really should have it all together and they don't and I'm not sure they will anytime soon! DO NOT QUIT YOUR CURRENT JOB TO WORK HERE!!"
bad,Wouldn't work at another Chili's again. Had lots of issues there and the amount of work was not worth the pay. A lot of servers had problems at work as well and no just with the customers.
bad,"Would not recommend to anyone, poor management and staff acted like strangers. Ready to leave as soon as I went in. Once again, would not recommend to anyone looking for a job."
bad,It was crazy environment employees are disrespectful poor management. The management showed favoritism when ever a  situation occurred.
bad,"Management picked their favorites, and even though I was their best bartender, I didn't fit their mold. I really enjoyed my co workers and guests, but felt I was taken advantage of."
bad,As an employee of Chilis for 6 years there are not many opportunities for advancement. The management team are inconsistent and not very supportive.
bad,It was difficult to work there after one manager left. She was the only manager that worked hard and the rest caused a lot of cognitive dissonance. I believe this chilis restaurant has the highest turnover in the twin city area. Managers are clueless and inexperience in handling employees needs.
bad,Easy place to work. I learned a great deal from each store I was placed in - that was over 5. The company is great the advancement opportunities are few.
bad,"Ability to learn how to multi-task and interact with Guest. Giving great Guest service. Answering the phones and processing orders, and also preparing Togo orders as a bartender while making drinks for the entire store."
bad,Everyday is something different. You can never predict a day at my job.
bad,The company was not very flexible with work and school schedules.
bad,fun place to work and they had good staff for the most part and delicious food all the time
bad,"Weekdays were usually slow but fridays and saturdays were hectic. Management did not do very well when it came to caring for their employees' needs. My coworkers were friendly most of the time but some obviously had bad days. I enjoyed my job overall but it was kind of hard being on your feet all day with no break. It was rare to get a free meal and only happened when I took a double shift. I was always overtime on my hours and my managers still did not appreciate my dedication to my job. I really enjoyed meeting new people and catching my coworkers on a good day. One of the worst parts of my job was being yelled at even though I would help the servers, bussers, and bartenders when I had the chance. I was not appreciated as an employee as much as I should have been. I learned to work hard but to take a break on my days off; instead of stressing myself out by doubling back to back."
bad,"Quick money, poor management. A good job over all if they could maintain consistent balance and work flow. A great place to engage in team member building skills and cultural values."
bad,"Management makes it hard for you to stay by cutting your hours per week and giving you less than 40 per week. Staff members are very unfriendly and hostile to work with and have no empathy and rude. Managers on some weeks tell you to only work 3 days. I would not recommend this company to anyone, it is a dead end job. No future working here."
bad,"In past not hood management and corporate does nothing for hourly employees.  The new management at this location is very good but corporate does nothing to help part time hourly employees.  Why should a sever promote anything, just do the ownership can be rewarded"
bad,"Even if you schedule time off in advance, they will threaten to fire you if they schedule you anyway and you don't show up.I had scheduled time off three weeks in advance and they scheduled me anyway and then threatened to fire me if I did not come."
bad,"The store was wonderful aside from in fighting with staff, and serious miscommunication.  Some servers would be too busy arguing or gossiping to get their orders, or be attentive to the customers. The changes that forced the hosts to be server aids while also; Keeping constant guard of the front door, holding the door, cleaning and bussing tables, taking and running drinks, running food, organizing for large parties, mamaging reservations, and only getting about 5% of all tips. Which servers were told only to submit tips that come out to 10-15% of the tickets price. Not to mention the manager tried to sleep with my mom and subsequently got my kicked out of my house."
bad,"they're severely under staffed."
bad,"Overworked with no breaks. They missed one of my pay days, paid me 2 weeks later, but wasn’t the correct amount. Overall an easy job, but managers can be demanding. They’ve called me while I was in school asking me to come in. Coworkers weren’t very friendly."
bad,"I worked for the company for a few months and in that time 8 workers ,including manager and bartender, quit. I was shuffled to fill in the gaps but was eventually stonewalled for 5 weeks (no schedule but no termination) confusing both me and the co-workers with me. I do not by any means have any hard feelings towards Chilis, and will be a chilihead for life.. But this particular one needs corporate touch."
bad,"When i was hired i was told since i had experience serving id be able to move up faster and start serving. i applied as a host to learn the restaurant and tables and make sure id be a good server there without asking too many questions. i was hired in January and its July and i haven't been moved up. they moved up every single host they hired after me and made excuses like ""oh we need more hosts before we can move you up"". they also asked me every time i brought it up, ""do you have friends that wanna be hosts and work here."" i dint know it was my job to get people to hire. two months later they hired more hosts and still moved them up before me. they hired more servers and food runners and didn't care to move me up. i even had some of the servers and food runners ask why i wasn't being moved up and they also talked to the managers about it. Also some servers told me they were being treated the same or similar to how i was. recently, i had a wedding i needed to attend and i requested it off and released the shift a week before and reminded one of the managers that i couldn't work. one of the managers called me while i was there and asked me why i didn't come in then blamed me the next day for not requesting it off or releasing it on hot schedules. also told me that the manager i reminded told him the conversation never happened. i went beyond what my ""technical"" job was and bused tables for the servers, rolled silverware, took drink and food orders, always asked ""is there anything i can do"" if it was slow or before my shift ended. managers didn't care if i was injured and needed"
bad,"First and foremost, the clientele here is awful. $2 tips or getting stiffed isn't uncommon. General manager is disrespectful and doesn't care about employees, sits in the office all day only comes out to yell at everyone when we're struggling, etc. The only thing that keeps me from losing my mind is the staff and the supervisors. (Almost) all of them are fantastic people with great senses of humor to get you through those rough shifts"
bad,The co workere are fun alway cracking jokes and playing around.  Pay isnt enough if you want to live on your own. management's a joke. Its a great job for high schoolers
bad,Management is unskilled and doesn't care about their job. Servers have no skills and can barely perform their duties. Kitchen team is completely uncooperative and slacks in their duties. The only way one would enjoy this job is by working here is by being a server because you won't have to do much. The management will do most of your work for you if you wait long enough. You will also be thrown into your job with little to no training. Management will also give you the run around if you want to switch jobs.
bad,Great servers and cooks. Managers are on a power Trip. Not all of them but the kitchen manager especially. The rest the managers come in and work but don't exactly manage.
bad,"Te obligan a que compres dulces que ellos deben de vender para apoyar a una Fundación que ellos apoyan y si no los compras ""voluntariamente"" te lo descuentan de tus ganancias o bien te castigan."
bad,"If you did not hit goals, you would get cursed at from director.  You worked as a Manager, but would also be running positions in all areas of the restaurant.  They would tell you to staff it but if you did not hit the labor goals they would call you and curse at you."
bad,Strange culture which makes it impossible to hold anyone accountable.  Long hours. They will listen to any customer complaint no matter how illogical.  Hard to get things repaired.
bad,"The managers kept hiring more and more hosts so we each had one shift a week. We all wanted more hours so they would train some of us to do some of the back of house jobs. I was there the longest and they would never move me up, always made me feel unappreciated. Does not value employees. And everyone talked about everyone, super annoying. It was a lot of drama."
bad,"It may have just been my position, but working at Chili's as a dishwasher is as bad as taking six college courses a week. There was no actual training, no assistance to warm me up to doing it on my own, and the nights I were there just felt like a total drag. The little enjoyment I had was the calmness of organizing and cleaning dishes, but then I was told not to fully clean them."
bad,"A job that will give you hours to pay he bills, rent, buy groceries. Offer growth opportunities. Besides discounted food! Stop offering sub par food to customers and selling it as if it's made from scratch. Stop only hiring African Americans and Mexicans to work in the BOH."
bad,The entire corporation is more about making money than their employees. Poor managing and favoritism plagues the Crystal River location. I'm not sure about all Chili's but the wage you are paid is not a living wage.
bad,"I would usually work 10-12hr days and do 10x the work and not get paid for it. When I talked to a manager about an advancement in my job they told me I had to do this, this, and that. So I ended up doing what was asked of me so that I could get more money and when I went to ask again there was another problem. So with that I ended up leaving because I felt as if I  wasn't getting treated right or paid for the amount of work I was doing. Management was terrible, it seemed as if all the managers focused on FOH(front of house) and barely acknowledged the kitchen. If a kitchen member asked for something it would take the managers a while to help or assist the kitchen in what they needed. However the employees were fantastic to be around despite what management had going on. The employees really made it an enjoyable experience for me."
bad,Chilis was a good place to learn the restaurant ropes. With that being said the management was not so great. Continued to feel as if I was not cared for and that is was just a person they had to deal with on a daily
bad,Very interesting place to work. There is almost zero opportunity for job advancement along with no benefits and horrible pay. The management is not the best and I hated working there due to the fact that no matter how hard I work there was always problems with another component of the restaurant to dishearten the customers. And also no matter how hard I worked it didn’t reflect in my small amount of pay.
bad,Very poor management team. Way too much stress for a serving job. Management walks all over the team members. Management is usually no where to be found when any issues arise
bad,"Very stressful, management can not keep employees. Always hiring and the turn over is high. No advancement and the management have no clue how to run this store. I can say, they know how to sweep everything under the rug when the big wigs are around and, they cover up very well."
bad,I've worked for the company for 3 years been at  2 different stores and worked at all in my area. I pick up every shift possible and have even come back from out of town to cover shifts. Instead of this being a good thing I'm picked on because I have epilepsy and am never given a break when on a double.
bad,You get there and instantly have to start cleaning and stocking because the people before you never do it. On top of that you have to make sure you are getting out your orders in under ten minuets which sometimes is not possible because the prep people seem to never do their job. This is from a night shift or closer positions point of view.
bad,"The setup for dishwasher is dumb. You'll be by yourself even on the busy nights, no dishes get touched till 4-5pm, all trash is your responsibility with no help, you'll be the last out because you can't finish untill you get the cooks dishes, servers just throw dishes sometimes with food still on the plates trash included, management team claims they'll help but disappear first chance they get, and last not but not least there is far too much desire to be the next ""gossip girl"" tv show going on (in other words they gossip about everything)."
bad,"The dish pit was so small had little space to move around there well known no place to put anything,they got mad when I would put things away but they wouldn't have the servers do it when asked also management wouldn't help, they just stayed in the office & not help."
bad,"Tips were below min. Managers always want you to work more shifts but when you take time off there’s an issue. Dbl shifts with no breaks, managers don’t care, they like hiding in the office more than working. You work much harder than you’re paid for. Definitely not worth it. Stay away!! At least from Chilis in Little Falls!"
bad,I have worked at Chili's for almost 2 years as a host at first then into a cooking spot. Raises are few in far between. You're consistently required to go above and beyond what you should be required to do just in order to be seen at all and not lose your hours. Cleaning duties are crazy and go well into 2 to 3 hours after close on some nights. They send cooks home based on who is approaching OT and not first in/first out. Terrible place.
bad,"Company isn't doing well and its showing.  Managers either don't care or are micromanaging to the point where you do not want to be there.  You can make some money but not as much as you used to be able to, their new system is not good for employees."
bad,"I wouldn't recommend anyone working here. I was miserable the entire time but ha to stick it out for my family. As soon as another opportunity arose, I took it!"
bad,The managers were really cool but the quality of the food was gross and the hours were not great. They didnt have enough employees so it was a very stressful environment.
bad,"Dishonest management, lack of motivated employees (front and back of house), lack of knowledge of restaurant environment, from the top to the bottom.."
bad,"You never receive any shifts, but the atmosphere is fun. the only money you make is on tip and if the customer does not give you a 5 review you will most likely not get shifts."
bad,"Aramark is not a company you want to work with. They do not take care of their employees and do not consider the repercussions. The management for the restaurant I worked at were the same age as me, and they didn't care."
bad,"The place in incredibly busy which is awesome, however, the management and kitchen struggle to keep up with the rushes. There is also a fairly quick turnover."
bad,"Just a job to get buy and pay the bills there is no work life ballence here managers expect a lot of hard work from you while they stand around and do nothing but joke around and disrespect there employees and stuff there faces with food. Uncomfortable work inviorment with unprofessional sarcastic management that care nothing about there employees only about what they are going to get out of the company for themselves, running there employees to the ground on a daily basses until there is no life left. Lack of supervision over the HOH team making it a uncomfortable work inviorment with a lot of drama and lack of team work. I don't know how the other chillis restaurant's in this company operate but someone needs to clean this place up and take out the trash."
bad,"I enjoyed my job for what it was, however, the location's management, and overall policy towards it employees is not something i would recommend to someone."
bad,"There are some great people who work at Chilis, but NOT all of them are. Some of the managers SHOULDN'T be managers. They don't know what they are doing, and it is a waste of money for the company. You literally have to burn the place down to get fired, they say they care....but trust me they don't"
bad,"Ill managed, poor environment, and lack of motivation in employees. Rarely did other employees care to provide great customer service, and focused more on their smoke breaks."
bad,"Im ready to find new employment soon. A more appreciative, more teamwork, and new friendly faces to be around and a company to grow with. thank you much."
bad,everyday walking into my store it was a stressful day.  the managers do nothing but hide in back! help was out of the question!
bad,"I loved working for this company, the first two years, the last three years were horrible. They could not keep management or employees! No one ever knew what was going on. I had to spend countless hours working over, because mangers would come in where ever they felt like it."
bad,you have to push yourself beyond your limits when a coworker call out which happens every week.sometimes you dont even get a break/the menu is to big for one person to do by themselves.
bad,"Poor training and low wages, allot of transision due to U.S taking over of canadian locations. Needs work on kitchen issues and food preparations,food quality and kitchen issues."
bad,When we first opened the restaurant it was new and fun but after a while it was not worth spending my time at a restaurant that was impossible to make any money.
bad,Little money. No change position. Manager so cheap. No break time for cooks. Always short in personal and everybody overwork with no overtime paid.
bad,"A typical day at work for me would depend what job that I am doing that day. If I am serving I would clock in and then go check in with a manager and see what's new or if we are out of anything. If I am doing To-Go then I would clock in and go get my money drawer from the manager. I will then start working whether i would be running food or greeting customers I would be busy either way. Some of my management team aren't very good, especially my General Manager she thinks she can do whatever she wants but she isn't fair with that many people, like if my co-workers have another job or if they are going to school she doesn't care because she has a restaurant to run. She isn't fair with paying people evenly either. If they need me to host I expect the same pay as the recent hosts so I will be treated fairly also with the QA position they are suppose to get paid $10/hr and so if they need me to QA for someone I want the same pay as them, it is only fair. I like most of my co-workers they are nice and we for the most part help each other out. Gilroy Chili's is seriously like high school because of all the drama that goes on there though. The hardest part of the job is getting on certain co-workers bad side because they are in good terms with the person in charge so you don't want to get fired for something stupid and also dealing with management. I can't think of the most enjoyable part of working at that job is."
bad,Chilis is a place where each day is a different day. The management and staff we all make our day fun and professional.
bad,Too much drama. It's hard to work in an environment where your bosses chat about everyone. Cannot stay level-headed.
bad,"a typical day consisted of coming in to a disorganized, unstocked, unclean line. Missing prep required for the shift, and equipment not properly taken care of. The lack of caring by employees to be on time and sober and the inability or lack thereof from management to control these issues leaves much to be desired. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the mass inadequacy that ran rampant through not only HOH but FOH as well. The most enjoyable part was being able to cook your own food{providing of course that you are HOH staff} and knowing that you will move on to better things."
bad,Taking care of the guest making drinks serving their food in a timely fashion handling money I enjoyed the guest most of all. Management could have been a little more helpful at times I Loved my coworkers we all made it a fun place it come to on a day to day bases.
bad,"I've transferred within Chili’s on multiple occasions so, I'm only going to rate the location I'm currently at. I feel undervalued as an individual. My hard work is taken advantage of. I am nothing more to them than a dollar sign. At the other locations I’ve worked everyone was treated with respect. Hard work was praised and rewarded."
bad,"It was fun when I first started there. Then I began to notice the managers played the favorite game. Their lack of discipline towards employees when they call off, back talk, or the insubordnation was horrible"
bad,Poorly managed. Management does not make overall cleanliness a priority unless there's a planned visit from someone big in the company or from the health department.
bad,Loved the job itself management was horrible waited a month for my check resulting in me leaving the company gm walked out one day if you needed to call out for anything regarding family matters there was an issue managers sometimes were 2-3 hours late opening
bad,"The Chili's I worked at was horrible in almost every way. However, it is a nation wide- possiblly international- company. They habe great values and a wonderful mission statement. Chili's-Lakeshore in Birmingham, AL does not uphild to these standards."
bad,It’s ok to work for chili’s they never give me a chance but  I prefer to work someone who care about your team and build relationships and to many menu changes
bad,"The job was ok. It was a lot of work,too much time and not enough money. Management was slightly helpful. Great Gm poor assistant managers. Overall not enough money for me to continue."
bad,"I worked at various chili’s locations over 3 1/2 years and they all had some kind of issue. My last location being downtown Philadelphia, you would think downtown would be busy, but it was actually pretty slow a lot of times. Busy moments would be if there was a convention in town or something like that. Chilis has cheap food  so to me that screams low tips or no tip at all. That location attracted a lot of younger people who dont care to tip."
bad,I just wouldn't go back. Not my kind of restaurant. I prefer a place where my management backs me up and doesn't just immediately go against me. Environment was toxic.
bad,The people i work with is very helpful to me i like the job i dont like how managers deal with situations to fit themselves its alot of favoritism that goes on at this place and people loose their jobs behind it
bad,It was very Poorly organized. They were always under staffed. The other employees were always late. The management at chili's was terrible. It was an overall unpleasant work place.
bad,"Money is horrible and never consistent, absolutely no benefits to work there. Menu is getting cheaper by the day which brings in terrible tippers on very low check averages as is. Management is horrible"
bad,There on a Fast Road to losing everything over all management is more concerned about profit V.S the Customer  they make you feel as a employee  like you are expendable and very easy to replace No real room for advancement unless you've been there for years upon years they need to learn to listen to there employees more instead of trying to dictate over them Faverostism is big there and the turn over rate is at a all time high
bad,Workers are lazy and managers dont do nothing to change how things are ran the work environment is not how a restaurant should be nor feel while your at work
bad,"I have worked here for about a year and a half , almost everyday I have to force myself to come here just so I can build up my savings for college, expect that if you put effort into your job it's gonna get overused and taken advantage of at every moment of the day One example is I was made to do both to go and qa on a Saturday afternoon while still being clocked in for to go at 8.25 an hour when I am already trained as a qa would make 12 an hour I am already looking for a job and if you are considering joining the ""chili heads"" don't"
bad,"I worked for chili’s for almost half a year. The management tried really hard to be everyone’s friend but that got confusing when they tried to pull you aside to talk about ways you could improve. Hosts had to constantly worry about pleasing both the servers and the management, so that was always very stressful. They were very willing to work with my school schedule."
bad,It was a great place to work as far as teaching me how to be a server. But it became very competitive and rules were not enforced unless they chose to enforce them.
bad,"I was with the converse location for almost 2yrs before i had enough.  My team members were awesome to be around with and some of my mangrrs knew what they were doing. The main manger on the other hand was tuff to work with. She stop caring about the place and took it out on everyone.  If you want to work for this company,  do not go to converse location."
bad,"it was ok working there at first but the staff are rude the management doesn't take care a problems immediately at all. But a typical work day for me was"
bad,"My duties were line cooking and setting up dishes for customers, the management at he time was not the best. Overall it was a good first job. I left to get a better paying job."
bad,I don't  know what to say about tips but most of the people tip awful a lot of kids come there hey  whatever it's works cause they have a whole lot of them
bad,"I was not a good fit for Chili's.  I had a very young child, a wife who was a full-time student, and my work weeks exceeded almost 70 hours a week.  Not for me."
bad,"Management was terrible. They treated their hosts terrible. There's an excessive amount of drama. I was bullied by some of my coworkers. Every day they run out of napkins or togo boxes or something, or they're understaffed."
bad,a typical friday night at chilis was very wild. Things do not run smooth with FOH and BOH. Food takes long and customers do not come first. The employees are nice people and management tried to help but usually didnt. i wouldn't recommend working there
bad,They really need new management. I learned everything on my own. the hardest part of the job was dealing with so many different personality. the best part of the job was the break meal.
bad,Ive been working here almost two years with no raise a nd i do just about everything. I cook clean dishwash and prep for not even 9 dollsrs a hour its sad.
bad,"Typical day at work was hosting and bussing tables."
bad,"If you can't stand the heat, stay out of the kitchen is not a joke. Extremely fast paced and stressful. I couldn't stand the heat. The hours were terrible work from 11am-1pm go home, come back, work 5pm - 1am. No time to gather your thoughts, management wanted you working, done, and out ASAP. Not the job for me."
bad,"I was a hostess and we'd help bust tables even when there were people to sit waiting on service. "
bad,Worst possible place you could work unless you were extremely desperate I would not advise ANYONE to work there the money isn't even worth the hassle.
bad,"A typical day at work wasn't an easy going on, there was always problems coming from somewhere. I learned that teamwork is a key point to have to keep a balance atmosphere. The management was not the best, but they did most of their job. The culture was not the best, but it was dealt with for the most part. The hardest part of the job was dealing with all of the emotions from the workers. The most enjoyable part was meeting new guest and connecting with them."
bad,"Depends on location, Noblesville is better than Muncie. Muncie has poor management and poor teamwork between the servers, unpleasant culture. I make good money there because the store is busy, but cuts are made very late and don't expect shift food."
bad,I really hope it was just the chili's I worked at that had horrible managers. They never wanted to help and it felt like they almost went out of their ways not to do what was needed.
bad,"Had a great time working for Chili's.The management was probably my least favorite part they were unprofessional, horrible with scheduling, and did not care about any personal issues if it conflicted with work."
bad,"Used to care about employees, but now they just treat them like numbers. They care more about labor hours and their bonus than they care about customers experience."
bad,"bad pay, horrible benefits and you're bound to hit your glass ceiling within a year. Biased work environment and all sorts of useless employees who get away with way too much"
bad,"A typical day was very exhausting on a busy day. I have learned that serving is not an easy job. While I worked there, we went through at least 7 managers. My co-workers were great for the most part. The customers were the hardest part of that job. The most enjoyable part was closing time."
bad,"I use to work 9hrs a day/ week and get 1day off, i learn the mexican food and italian food how it taste and how it have been prepare all this time and like to work under presure"
bad,Even the managers there with 15 yrs in make under 35k a year and they work 60 hrs a week. Bad management skills are the consequences.
bad,Staff there was really close and never opened up to new people. Bulling was very common in the work place. Management was a title and not a job at Chili's.
bad,Its an ok place to work at. Very few people stay for more than a year. they are ok with scheduling but sometimes take a while if understaffed which happens quite often.
bad,"Upon taking this job, I was under the impression that I would start in one possition and move up very quickly. I was mislead about how fast i would be trained in other areas to work different jobs. I was mislead about I was going to be paid. I feel the management team has it's strengths and it's weaknesses because they aren't all on the same page. I wish my experience at Chili's had been more possitive."
bad,"This job consumed my entire life. I was given 8 shifts in six days, which is working six days a week with two double shifts. Management did not treat employees well. The only thing that has kept me at this job is how quickly I can make money. There is a new set of rules and new jobs every day. Management is awful with letting employees off for emergencies. Many times we ran understaffed or a sick staff. This restaurant cannot keep employees. Many new hires walked out on this job because of the high stress and lack of care from management."
bad,i was hired as a fry/grill cook and was made to work as a dish washer for the first month. co-workers fought often. managers were seldom there.
bad,"there you work as a team player, make friend, and make sure your customers leave happy."
bad,all in a days work you will be stiffed and mistreated and if it weren't for the upstanding guests that occasionally come in i would have been gone a long time ago
bad,"Basically i went in for a shift and waitressed on average 3 hours, but mostly picked up extra hours doing doubles. It would very with money depending on what day it was. I felt that the management did a pretty good job staying on task with quota's and sales. As far as the way myself and many other co workers were treated i believe they were very clicky at times and unfair with shifts and unfair treatment. But the most enjoyable part about it was working with the military and giving back to them through a smile and great service."
bad,"I hated this job. At the time I took the job, it was a job. The managers are bad and honestly they don't know how to manage a restaurant."
bad,"Worked in Alpharetta. Management was cool. The rest of the staff were petty, non team oriented, and some exuded glimpses of racism. Manipulating the seating arrangement in hopes of seating an assumed better tipper. Meaning showing preferential treatment to white patrons. God bless."
bad,It’sa server job. You won’t make a fortune here but you’re going to have short hours and a flexible schedule. If you’re looking for quick cash then this is the job for you.
bad,"Working at Chili's has potential to be good, but overall its the management that makes or breaks working there. You will be in a lot of high stress situations when working in a restaurant, and I've found that management usually doesn't help in the matter, and in fact usually adds to the stress. If you like the manager, then it might be fine, but if they're a jerk like mine was, then you're in for an extremely rough time."
bad,The coworkers  are fantastic whereas management is absolutely awful. Half the time you need a manager you wind up calling for one 5 minutes and they still get annoyed about you needing them. There are no bussers and the servers are lazy and entitled so they leave tables full of dirty dishes and hosts are expected to man the front and keep the restaurant clean. They’re understaffed on a daily basis so hosts are also asked to food run as well and the best part is you don’t get tipped for anything you do unless a server feels nice enough to do it
bad,The works is fun and easy the company has good benefits but the management team is HORRIBLE!!! The general manager needs corporate called on her so maybe she'll learn to respect the employees that bust their butts for her
bad,Fue mi primer trabajo y  me quedaba lejos el trabajo ya no pude seguir laboraron ai
bad,"This company at one time sincerely cared about its people.  After the ""realignment"" of above restaurant leaders, chilis is ONLY focused on 2 things... productivity and increasing shareholders money..  There was a time where the most important part  of running this great company was its ""people"" and the ""guests"" return..   If your only concern  is numbers and adding to the bottom line than this is for you..."
bad,"This place isn't a bad restaurant, it's just a bad Chili's. The moment I walk in I see the chaos unfold everyday and I begin to wonder whether people actually do their jobs or do they just do whatever they feel like. All to say that this place needs a lot of work and upkeep just to be on a normal level.   I do believe that this place can do better if it was more structured and more organized rather than everyone doing their each individual jobs."
bad,the management is bad they dont care very much about you. pay is low. co-workers are rude. there can be some favoritism. low staffing. dirty work place.
bad,"The hosting jobs here suck, I was forced to the bottom every time I had a chance to go up in the ladder. Every person that I trained ended up being put in positions that I was promised."
bad,poorly managed company.  no paid vacations.   no availability is accepted you must when they schedule you even if you have a second job.   no request off is accepted.   overall it was one of the worst managed companies i have ever worked for.
bad,"It changed after the 14years I was there. I asked for a raise because I was doing so much more & was told no. Also favoritism is a problem. Hard workers shoulder much of the work, while others do nothing"
bad,Managers more concerned with scores than taking care of their people. Can’t understand why we got low scores when it would take 45 min for a burger to come out and somehow that was the wait staff problem. They didn’t care if you needed time off or a schedule change because of family issues and then allowed other people to “vote” as to allow people to work there as opposed to actual work ethic and behavior. Very high school drama oriented. performance. Ver
bad,"I was fortunate enough to work with a great GM when I first started; he made the high stress and low tips bearable. Unforunately in my time there I also got to see one of the worst managers I believe I have ever had in my time in the service industry. The company is honestly going down hill not because of my horrible experience with management, but for the food quality is horrible now a days. They used to be a place where you could get decent food at a lower price now its premade, packaged and pre cooked food."
bad,The company is a dumpster fire. They invented this whistleblower hotline to make the staff or team members feel better about coming to work. And in return they just created this let’s get rid of a manager hotline that we don’t like they could basically call and say whatever to them. They would listen to the team member and then terminate manager I’ve seen it happen at least a 15 different people
bad,Management is extremely rude and unprofessional. nobody does anything.. The servers are never getting help from the managers and are always stressed out. multiple people quitting from the filth in the kitchen and the food that gets served out is ALWAYS cold. it sits on the metal food rack for up to 30 minutes just getting looked at. managers would rather sit on their phones and complain than actually do something useful.
bad,Not enough hours but would make one person work on floor doing two jobs. There is a different set of managers there now. The place has been updated recently.
bad,"The people I work with are fantastic."
bad,"In theory, chili’s seems like a really fun place to work, and i really think it has the potential to be, but it depends on location  and clientele in my opinion. I love my coworkers and all my management, but the clientele in our area is just awful. Bad tippers (and I’m a very experienced, skilled server) and sexually harassed at least once a shift. Chili’s as a whole i think is a great company though I’ve worked at 2 different locations and enjoyed my first location very much."
bad,"It’s a relaxing job , but I’m trying to separate my self and improve by surrounding my self with other people who will help me improve so I can finish school ."
bad,I really dont have anything to say. The general manager shows favorites and the server manager was sexist and racist. I loved the new manager that came in. He was very involved and made sure his team had what they needed unlike the others.
bad,"I worked there for 4 months, GM and Second in command were lazy and rude when it came to even asking to pick up a shift. If you're planning on trying to get a job here, don't, let em burn."
bad,Its wack to work here. Your quality of life/family suffers for the back of the house. Look for a better job if u have a family. Like most jobe they make false promises. They make it seem like they're helping u out...when in reality its the other way around.
bad,"horrible management, never know what to expect each day. Stressful, managers really don't care about employees. its like a high school, too much drama. would not recommenced"
bad,"If you like good food and even better people, don't go to Chili's. Just not a good place to work. It had problems with management to dishwasher. Just don't do it."
bad,"Working at Chili's used to be great, I got great hours, new positions and got to train people and overall it was an amazing experience. Until new mangers came into the picture, after the general manager left  the kitchen manager took over and the restaurant was still great. That was until a different manager came in and tried to make his employees fear him rather than  respect him. This same manager threatened to take away shifts from and and when telling the manager up I was told to basically told I need to get better. The employees act like children, some even are intoxicated while on shift and not a word is said. I have had issues with management and coworkers and would never recommend working at Chili's Milpitas"
bad,Over all store operations. This was not a good fit for me. I was moved to a store away from home and told to fix it. In my opinion the store needed to be shut down and the employees retrained. This is all a i have to say about that.
bad,"i like it there it just a quick pace job that what i like ntn "
bad,It was okay the interesting part was the people I worked with and the hours that I worked. It was a positive work environment and the food was good and reasonable
bad,"Start day by cleaning and stocking station for the coming dinner rush. I learned that there was a group within Chili’s that stuck together and did not like my kind (I’ve never been mixed up in racism, but they definitely didn’t like me, not sure why... well I know now.) "
bad,"I work 6-7 days a week and sometimes work doubles because employees are not strictly enforced to come into work which is annoying on my part for being depended on to work shift that aren’t even mine. And i work so hard making sure i’m pacing everything and bussing everyone’s tables and they don’t even share tip. I don’t have to buss tables but i do generously to keep the flow going. The managers are pretty awkward don’t really help me much, i end up trying to figure things out on my own and try to work on situations myself. the pay checks i would get are horrible and you definitely can’t live off what you get from there. On weekends there should be two hosts and when i don’t work there is two but when i work there is just 1"
bad,There was little to no room for advancement for someone who constantly worked their tail off. The work was cut-throat but I appreciated receiving more experience working in a fast-paced environment. I would never go back to cooking for the restaurant industry.
bad,"This isn't a career, this is a job. If you're young, single and you need an entry level gig to get some experience, or if you need something quick and part time, this is for you."
bad,The store is pretty crazy. I understand it is a restaurnt.  Yes but at the same time why is it that so many people leave.......  yes can always get a replacement but there shouldn't be that much of a change. Seems like there no eye to eye. Lack of communication. As well lack of being on the same page. 1 tell you one thing and then the others do any other.
bad,"I never want to work here again the management went down hill. I work there for 5 years and did every position. I wanted to further myself among the corporation thinking I could improve it my self. But no, I couldn't its disorganized and unprofessional."
bad,its a very stressful environment and doesn't really allow you to make what is needed to pay for living expenses. cooks are under paid for the amount of work that is put into the restaurant
bad,"To match our labor with our declining sales they schedule one person to do the job of 3. As a server you will seat your tables, serve them, wash dishes, and then bus the table. Its awful. And we have new managers every couple months. Pros: good discount on food, very relaxed if its slow you dont have to do anything but talk to your friends, flexible schedule."
bad,"Chili's is a widely known and massively popular franchise, so you can always count on business to be steady, some nights more so than others, but still consistent. There are always lots of servers coming & going, so each day holds something new."
bad,"The management has seriously gone down hill lately. I've worked for this company for  years and we lost alot of employees due to management. Also, corporate has created a new system that hardly works for it's employees. We are always understaffed and under paid. As a bartender my duties in the morning include, being the host, bar-tending, togo and QA  there has even been times where I had to go cook my own food!!!! Just to get paid $5.26 and hour and barely get tipped because I cannot attend to my guest properly."
bad,"Chilis is great for new managers.  The autonomy is minimal and the expectations are not too high.  The pay is decent if you have more experience but if you are someone that values the ability to do more and use your mind and skills, you will be miserable."
bad,"The servers were very rude, management never gave you days you requested off, customers were rude most of the time, lower amount of pay when rolling silverware, and you don’t get paid enough to do what is required."
bad,They should not allow managers to hinder the growth of employees or make them feel uncomfortable in the workplace by speaking a completely different language online when referring to another employee in their face just completely disrespectful
bad,"Same as Olive Garden, not enough money for the amount of time spent there.  Gratuity is greatly needed at both of these establishments.  Otherwise you be broke all the time"
bad,"I worked for Chilis for over 20 years off and on. I was not happy with the money or the hours I had to work with them as a Manager, You were never off. On off days you'd get text and emails all day. I remember doing employee schedules on my vacation. Work load was excessive and not good for family."
bad,"The managers are okay I guess, depends on which location you go to. You’ll work a lot of hours if you’re full time and not always make the money you should. Customers are pretty rude sometimes and tip badly."
bad,"I would go back but only for the money. Tree favoritism and choosing which policies are worth holding up depending on the worker is beyond ridiculous. When I was threatened no one cared when I had an issue with a coworker treating many others and myself intolerablely I was told ""this isn't high school"" I had 1 incident and was fired."
bad,"organized, efficient system used to get food out in time.  requires sold customer service skills and ability to multitask.  Quality of food is lacking"
bad,mangers bend the rules. never give accomplishments or recognition. there is no motivation to work hard. everyday was rough and the day we tried to make fun was rough
bad,"Chilis has a rich history. They are struggling to adjust to the new marketplace of causal dining, but they will find it and survive. There are some great people there, and there are some who do not live the culture."
bad,Chili's has gone down since the change in the ownership. The quality of life went down as well as a good quality work life. They started to focus more on firing TM's VS. Helping them develop.
bad,"There was nothing to do. If you like getting paid for doing nothing, then this is for you. I got in trouble once for cleaning around the restaurant, which makes no sense."
bad,"I have worked for chilis for 7 years, its a decent place to work. used to be a lot better but upper management I feel has taken the company in a negative direction."
bad,"They focus on the front of house and forget the back of house. They call back of house ""heart of house"" but it has no heart. All awards and challenges are for the front of house. The back of house gets broken promises. I have seen them go through over 20 cooks in less than a year. Their top level management has not kept up with the times. They are using ideas from the 90's it seems."
bad,"This is not a terrible place to work however it is a food industry, labor intensive place and for a little while there was no AC and the line would be in excess of 100 degrees with."
bad,And jealous co-workers with false allegations were my downfall.  They took advantage of a new gm and a new area director.  I've considered litigation since I left.  My initial years with them were great.  The last six years were really disappointing.
bad,"Managers were rude, one wasn't very smart and kept messing me up which slowed things down, When I called in I got attitude which wasnt't acceptable. I made some friend there but otherwise there was no real flexibility in that job like if you needed a day off."
bad,This was a typical food service job where they focus more on status like drink selling than they do customer service. It was an ok job while i was in college.
bad,"Was taught fast paced movement, team work and accountability. Helped aid me to advance in hospitality industry. The pay was not very good but definitely relied on customers and the fondness of your serving."
bad,"I enjoyed this positon as I could talk to the customers, and build solid relations, however when others abused their authority or went over their boundaries, I was led to leave company because management wasn't stepping in to handle the problems head on."
bad,"Not a fun place to work."
bad,"they hire you at 40 hours per week but only actually work you about 20."
bad,"I honestly believe that I would have enjoyed my time at Chilis a little more if the management was better. Also, if they provided breaks for their employees that would have made it perfect."
bad,People always run around here like chickens with their heads cut off. Everyone gets so stressed out when it gets busy. It's not very fun to come to work everyday walking into a nightmare.
bad,I was actually promoted from a team member to a Manager and the expectations are out of control. I was washing dishes more than being a manager. Or I was cooking because everyone would call in sick. The labor requirements made getting the job done properly impossible. Team members are unhappy and management is dragged through the gutter.
bad,My year and three months of working at chili's has been a tough but yet learning experience. It has showed me to stay on my feet through long shifts and has helped me gain a lot of  work endurance. It has also helped me to have respect to the people working in the customer service because it is not easy as it seems!
bad,"issues with staffing and changing policies led to poor morale,i don't know what else to say...things may be better there,now,as i have not been employed there for 3 years"
bad,Great place to work part time but unless you enjoy the ups and downs of not being able to budget your money this is not a long term job.   Management often struggled with supporting the team and making the customer happy.
bad,"don't care about employees"
bad,"my first year was great but that quickly went downhill, the management team treats there team like dirt and they never said thank you to us if we went above and beyond the call of duty."
bad,"It may just be much location but there are unrealistic goals being given and not enough logic. Managers aren't there for support and the workers are treated reminiscent of slaves, do as much as you can and be thankful you have a job is the attitude."
bad,"We don't get breaks even when working doubles, there's only one decent manager. The restaurant is a mess constantly not just appearance wise but in every way possible. If you need an income, like I do, then you deal with it but it's not a professional environment, whatsoever."
bad,I worked there too long without feeling wanted. The management team in my area seemed uninterested in the work and had no real values or care for employees
bad,"I loved the people that I worked with, but overall the job was very stressful. How stressful can a food service job be, right?? Management understaffed each shift. THey cared more about labor, than they did guest satisfaction or the capabilities of their staff."
bad,"Was not at chilis for to long, my manager was horrible, he would forget about me hosting and there would be no customers and I would still have to stand there doing nothing until 1 am"
bad,"Worked at a few locations and bumped into the same problems everywhere. Management is awful, the restaurants are dirty, and not much room for advancement. Worked there to pay for college but would not like to go through that again."
bad,I loved my regulars that came in to see me every week. Most of the crew was very nice and outgoing. you should always enjoy where you work. May god continue to bless you
bad,"Business seems to be dwindling by the day. The prices keep dropping, therefore tips keep dropping. Not worth working here. Management walks around meowing at people"
bad,"in my opinion, the company was solely focused on numbers and profits, and virtually not at all on the guest experience, although that is precisely what they sell you on at the door. Entirely too much micromanagement by district and regional supervisors, who had virtually no idea how to run an actual restaurant."
bad,"As a prep cook working at chili's I would have to clock in early. I would have to chop the vegetables up, marinade the meats before the store would open. The hardest part of the job was, when it get real busy and I'm done with preping I would have to go catch up on the dishes."
bad,This business helped me advance in my culinary career. It just wasn't managed right and they didn't pay what u was worth. I was promised raises I didn't get. Managers more worried about their bonuses
bad,I made the money i needed to make usually. Although the guests you get here are mostly all the people that come in do not want to tip and want to get in ans out of there as fast of possible. Your entire career there and how much you get scheduled and if you get the good shifts is ALL determined by the feedback and number of people you can convince to take the survery on the ziosk at the end of the meal
bad,"My work was easy enough to do. Greet and seat customers in a friendly and professional manner. My problem with this job lied solely with the managers. I felt that I worked pretty hard for someone who was just a hostess, I went above and beyond my responsibilities, but all of my efforts went unnoticed. I was looking to advance to serving and I got passed right over, and told that someone who I had been training was getting the promotion that I was seeking."
bad,It was fun to work at with my coworker. It was easy and always enjoyed my work shift. I worked 8 hours aday. It wasn't hard work at all.
bad,"The opportunity to work is available. However, the tips and overall compensation for time spent can vary substantially from day to day."
bad,Been here for over 2 years and the management has not change. Everyone picks favorites. If you got into a car crash all they would care about is if someone was coming in to fill that spot. Not if you were okay or alive. They can not keep employees there. Every a couple months there is a new crew. That is not how to run a business.
bad,"A typical work day meant taking customer orders and serving their food. Cleaning tables and floors to keep a sanitized restaurant, communicating with chefs and other servers to get food out on time. Taught valuable customer service skills as wells as serving and food expo skills maintaining food quality. Integrity was required to run the restaurant smoothly with busy managers."
bad,"The best part of this job was the discount on the food because we can all admit Chili's has bomb food!"
bad,"love the food!"
bad,"I left that place crying so many nights"
bad,"When I worked here I was studying. I looked for a summer job, and they offered me a position in hosting. It was a lot of fun. The way to maintain the areas was interesting, but for me, I couldn't keep the job position because I was studying."
bad,Work is fairly easy. I learned how to deal with happy/unhappy customers. Management is unfair and rude. Co-workers are adolescent. Dealing with rude co-workers was the worst part. I enjoyed making decent money and when the staff was productive.
bad,"Management is very dependable, usually fresh out of training with no experience. "
bad,"A typical day of working at Chili's included making sure restrooms were clean and stocked, greeting and entertaining customers, organizing and stocking hosts' stand, seating customers at tables or booths they preferred and were convenient for the servers, informing the employees in the kitchen of how many orders they should be prepared for, helping the servers as much as I could (refilling drinks, bringing out customers' food, and cleaning tables), keeping track of wait sheets when necessary, and sitting customers in a timely matter. I must honestly say, in my opinion, the managers did not do their job correctly. Whenever I told them about my coworkers not doing their jobs correctly, and leaving me responsible for picking up their slack, they did not report it, or take any action to correct the issues. The hardest part of the job, was having to pick up the slack of my coworkers, and having to go above and beyond my job responsibilities, in order to keep our customers happy, and the restaurant moving smoothly, and having no help from the managers. What I enjoyed most about working there was the fast paced environment, and being able to bring a smile to our customers' faces, and make sure they enjoyed their experience as much as I could."
bad,"cook and prep food"
bad,"it was hard and fast pace without a lot of opportunities to advance. i like hard, but i at least want a positive outcome in the end."
bad,"I loved the people, not the work. It is really stressful and some co-workers will take advantage of your help. I felt like as if I had to do millions of jobs and get paid very little for it. It was not worth the stress I experienced. It may not be like for others. I did enjoy the atmosphere and all the give back event we did. I do feel like we give back to our community, something I never experienced at other places."
bad,"Hours got cut and you don't make any money. Not a great environment if you are looking for something positive. After many years, the only changes made were negative ones. The money isn't even worth going in sometimes. This is a good job if you don't mind only working 2-3 hours a day."
bad,"Terribly managed. There was no manager communication whatsoever. My first 2 weeks 6 people quit because everyone was overworked and treated like garbage. Breaks are a thing of dreams even if you tell management you need a second to breath. It was definitely the most unhygienic working environment I've ever seen. Promises for advancement are never kept over and over again. Double standards from different managers run rampant throughout the restaurant. Outdated equipment in the kitchen have extremely poor ventilation. Seals on the stainless steal equipment were gone and everything was improperly cleaned, leading to insects pupating and then flying out of parts of the food storage equipment."
bad,"Happily greeted everyday by fellow co-workers. A very rough clientele to deal with. Not always a great place to want to spend a day in. Management is very lax and not eager to deal with unsatisfactory complaints or guests."
bad,"management was terrible. I did make a lot of money, would have kept it if management wasn't so terrible."
bad,"This job is better suited for younger people, like teens who need extra cash. Good for a first job but once your older you will want to progress somewhere better."
bad,"They no longer take care of the guest. They are only worried about hitting their labor. They put the management in a bad situation. The area directors only visit when the regional directors are in town. Don't work here, you will regret it."
bad,"This was my first job waiting tables. I found out very quickly that hard work goes unnoticed and kissing up goes far. The overall corporate structure was fundamentally flawed in that the menu changed almost every week, no one ever knew what exactly was expected of them, and the high stress caused each member (managers included) to lash out at each other."
bad,Not a great place to work. Management does not care about you they consider you just a number.
bad,Chili's Bar and Grill is an okay place to work. The management tried to help servers best they could in solving any customer issues. Teamwork was a must to work here. The co-workers got along for the most part.
bad,The Chilis and Starbucks I worked at was ran by a third party establishment.  Long hours no family life and no acknowledgements and thanks for doing extras.  the schedule would be such that you would work an evening shift and then have to open the next day... I remember some shifts I worked a 24hr period with not even a thank you for staying.  No extra compensation either.
bad,"While working here I've noticed that the managers do not communicate with employees. They as well do not follow their own guidelines or even those of the company by which they are employed. My co-workers, of course, tend to follow same example. However there are some who take charge and follow every guideline put in place. I am however happy that I have learned certain skills valuable in the restaurant workplace. Other than that, unfortunately, there is nothing else I can say that I enjoy about the environment I worked in. Other than the fellow employees who actually ""worked"" as I did."
bad,"When you clock in, dishpit area is a mess, trash overflowing, dishes pile up"
bad,My job at Chili's started out as an easy full time after getting married. This job allowed me to go to school and work at the same time.
bad,"A typical night at work would be long. You learn that people can be very cruel. Management knows that people are cruel, but they're paying so it's their luxury. Your co-workers are you troop-in arms so to speak and can either be the most enjoyable part of the job or the hardest part of the job."
bad,"Typical day at Chili's would be BUSY! Always on your feet staying at a fast paste. Chili's taught me that if ""their"" paying for it, there food, beverages, etc. will be just the way they want it! My co-workers at Chili's were awesome. We always worked as a team. Never let a table wait for their food if one of us was busy. Hardest part was carrying the huge trays, you have to make sure to set them on the arm the correct way or else something will fall! My most enjoyable part was of course my customers. Great conversations! When I first started and made small mistakes, as I would apologize they would reply with a "" its okay mam, your doing okay"" Sweet customers, great tips!"
bad,Management did not care about us as a team. They did what was best for them and not the company. A typical day at work was fun because most of the co-workers were friends. We worked hard and helped one another. My co-workers and the people we encountered made my job enjoyable. The hardest part of my job was management. Our set schedules would change without notice and they had a take it or leave it policy.
bad,"Unprofessional, unhappy Front of the House workers gets treated better and there's lack of respect for the kitchen workers,unresolved issues and lack of advancement and lack of raises,favortism,being taken advantage of but it's a job for now. I kinda regret ever applying here"
bad,"The level of disrespect coming out of management is absurd. I've seen many good cooks and servers make a simple mistake, which happens to all of us,  and a manager be completely unprofessional and out of line. It doesn't matter how hard you work because they play favorites. If you come in, work hard, and give it your all,  all you get is more work. But if you come in and get buddy buddy with therm,  you get it pretty easy."
bad,"When I first started working here I made great money, loved the people I worked with and they have great benefits even for part time servers. That’s the only reason I gave it two stars. Since they have implemented 3 for 10$ meals in the last year the customer base has basically become a bunch of cheapos. People coming in with checks only 10$ and then having 5 coupons they want to use. It’s basically become fast food for trashy people in a restaurant setting. Ready to work somewhere that doesn’t give every guest 5 coupons so that you have to run down the manager for every table. Ugh."
bad,I worked as a server for Chili's Bar and Grill. I really enjoyed the fast-paced environment. There was a buddy system where you and a coworker had a section together and you just helped each other with all the tables in your section. I made real good money. But I was fired for being late by two minutes and all the women there were late every day by at least ten minutes without even a slap on the wrist. Very poor management
bad,"Chili's is a strange environment; hourly employees may work any amount of time from 2 hour shifts to 7 hour shifts. I've suffered through a 15 hour day with only a half hour break, on multiple occasions, for lack of a specific position. The servers are money crazed, the management doesn't attempt to solve any internal conflict, and the guests don't always tip. In fact, often guests in ToGo don't tip at all, and dine-in guests are hit or miss. People leaving $5 on a  $65 bill may sound insane, but they're much more likely than you could ever know in this abomination. The cooks are underpaid, the hosts are underappreciated, and the rest of the staff is expected to go with whatever crazy schedule they can concoct. Good luck if you're considering this job, I hope your experience is better than mine was."
bad,Tips were not the greatest. The clientele was the worst I’ve ever experienced in the Industry by far. I wouldn’t mind going back if the money was worth it
bad,"Managers choose favorites and do not act on employee drama, very stressful place to work, and do not take into consideration emergency situations within family or home. Do not staff properly and over work servers sometimes. Manager gets way too frustrated when stress is high and doesn’t properly address problems, leaving guests angry, food times are always high."
bad,I am not sure about other locations but I do know that they have table side computers that are more like self service then the server them selves. Maybe other locations are not as gruelling but you would have to check it out for your self. At least they have outings for trainers or they use to.
bad,You get the brunt of everyones day trying to smile. No sick days unless you can cover your shift. That's simply the majority of the restaurant culture.
bad,"training, interviews, coaching and feedback, schedule, inventory"
bad,"Bad management, played favorites, long hours very shorthanded, always covering shifts for favorites with no. Recognition for a hard work or a good job done. Management always cursing and throwing things when we would get busy. Very bad turn over people that been longer working there not even offered a management position but still making about 17 bucks an hour. workers were good but the management was the downfall"
bad,"Apart from dealing with managers who schedule based on an unfair performance rating, often times ""guests"" were impossible to please. A lot of time and effort is spent on trying to satisfy and save face on ""guests"" while the kitchen would constantly make food incorrectly. Often times it will be perceived as the servers fault for making food improperly. Very very frustrating environment, but the pay is received that same day and was often decent despite the troublesome tables"
bad,"Chili’s is by far the most understaffed company I have ever worked for. They overwork you like crazy if you are evenly slightly above average. I know what kind of server I am and believe me I am in no way super-server. I can barely juggle four tables and they have me in the hardest sections, working doubles nearly 4 days a week, 10 hour shifts. That’s sad because I know I am barely average. There is way too much side work that will keep you in the restaurant nearly two hours after you are cut. The poor managers are forced to work over 60 hours a week. Corporate needs to get real and allow for stores to have server assistants (bussers) and food runners. Maybe their turnover rate wouldn’t be nearly 200%. The staff wants to blame their store managers but it’s CORPORATE. Nothing will change until corporate stops being so greedy."
bad,"When I first started working there the job was good I genuinely enjoyed working there. As time progressed I started seeing different sides of people, especially managers. I felt overworked and I was all in all tired. I often worked 5pm-10pm which is not bad but then I worked almost everyday of the week which is tiring being a high school student. I would not recommend it."
bad,"Long hours"
bad,When I got the job at chili’s I was promised at least 20 hours a week starting at 9.25 with room to advance into To-Go and serving. After about 4 months my hours were cut to less than 15 hours a week.
bad,"I mainly helped the other workers and, if we had a lot of business then I would  take orders and deliver food. when we had food trucks I would also unload them"
bad,My time in this establishment was fairly brief as it was simply a part time job while I was still in high school. I was employed as dishwasher with no promise of advancements. Eventually I left the job after being accepted into a summer long social program in UCLA.
bad,"This is pretty lengthy but I was fired from Chili’s and and it seems unfair. Poor training and management for new employees. Received only negative feedback. And I had no room to become better. I went in really excited to build skills as a waitress (with no serving experience). Memorized the menu perfectly before starting. Wasn’t trained efficiently from one server in particular who moved so fast without explaining thoroughly. Felt like a helper following her around. She gave up on me in the middle of my shift because she handed me a check and said to take care of it without telling me how and where to do that. She told the managers I was not good enough to do the job after my third day there. They said I couldn't have a chance on the floor because they received bad feedback from this trainer (although the others said I had great skills to become a server, what about them?). I understand cash handling is very important but if i has been instructed properly this would not have occurred. They delivered this to me harshly that I started crying. I told them that I believed I could do the job and they let me work after I waited on the managers to judge me themselves. My first night serving was fine, second night great and I made $150. All the customers liked me and left me big tips. The third day I made a few mistakes like rang in an order under the wrong thing, gave someone a 16 not 22 oz beer and took down an order as a plain quesadilla when she wanted classic chicken (although she did say cheese quesadilla.. doesn’t every quesadilla have cheese?) My manager sat me down and told"
bad,Over 15 mangers in 3 years. No teamwork. Constant back stabbing and fear based leadership. No reward for high performance even though rewards were promoted at other restaurants and corporate emails.
bad,"As a to-go server, I took orders, handled money, and delivered orders.  I organized the area and kept things straight.  Very fast paced and busy day times"
bad,Chili’s is an ok place to work at and I probably wouldn’t work there ever again tho. Hard work for low pay and long hours. A job is a job though so whatever
bad,"The management was beyond poor, i was part time and they had me working 40+ hours a week along with giving me an hour notice when someones shift wasn't covered, rude coworkers"
bad,"There isn't anything great I can say about this job. There was favoritism from management that could change with the weather. Inconsistent hours and rushes didn't provide a stable work environment. Especially if it was your main source of income. The only saving grace for this job was working with people you got along with, and getting lucky enough to work with managers you can tolerate."
bad,"Work at Chili's (diamond circle) was stressful and the management between the four managers was poor. After taking a month off that was required for my health, I was not out back on the schedule after repeated requests. I had let all managers know of my absence at the time of being hired and months in advance for employment. After I came back from my absence, I was told that the managers thought ""I quit,"" even though I had communicated during the duration of my employment there. I quickly gave my two weeks notice upon being given the information that I was moving to a different city, and told the managers the exact week I could not work due to moving. They of course scheduled me said week, and when I communicated that there was absolutely no way for me to make it in that entire week, and that no one could cover, I was scolded and berated by the front of house manager. I quit on the spot and was insulted for doing so. Overall, awful workplace."
bad,I like working there but the way certain managers handle business is not exactly the greatest.In conclusion I believe Chili's as a company can come together and create a solution where employees are paid fairly and given hours based on availability.
bad,"Some of the servers are probably the nastiest girls I've ever encountered in my 13 + yrs working in food service.. or even way back in high school! They tear others down instead of building them up to work together as a team, which is so important there, because there are no bussers or expo, and hardly ever a host scheduled, so everyone does everything. Servers even wash dishes at lunch. It's hard to be happy and welcoming to your guests when you're being treated like s*** right behind the corner."
bad,"I would never recommend anyone to work at Chili's, now that they have made the 3 for 10's a permanent staple to the menu. With servers only making $2.13 an hour (which only covers taxes), lowering ticket prices really hurts the servers. I've never had an actual check come from being a server there and with tip"
bad,While working at chili’s 8+ people quit because of one single manager. They Schedule you outside your availability. Waiting to get a new job then quitting. Not a great place to work. But coworkers are awesome
bad,"Employees usually attended to their cell phones more than guests.  Management is unwilling to enforce rules.  Servers will constantly complain about how they didn't receive a tip, being a server myself and not getting tipped I know sucks, but when the it becomes a constant thing it really brings everyone down.  I maintained a positive attitude and it made me one of the consistently highest earning servers in the restaurant.  People have a tendency not to do their side work and management shrugs it off.  Hardly ever clean.  Also working in the restaurant industry doesn't come with breaks all that much.  All that being said it can be a rewarding job when you come home with a lot of cash money and developing friendships with guests and coworkers is good."
bad,"The company's cool, but the manager was not. It took me 8 months to get the position that I applied for, even though I was told it would only take two. After the fact I was supposed to get a raise and never did. And they just treated the employees badly. This is strictly the 5600 West location"
bad,"I would not recommend anyone to work there, it's as simple as that. We were over-staffed with nothing but lazy people who waited for everyone else to do their job, you were lucky if you got 20+ hours a week."
bad,"In my thirteen plus years of working for Chili's I always felt replaceable. That corporate didn't care if I worked for them or not. That I was not valued. My usual day would involve being a line cook or prep person, more as a fill in the spot person then a manager. I learned in my time there how to do all the administrative work involved with being a manager including profit and loss, dealing with vendors, hiring responsibility,  inventory and ordering. Upper management is more concerned with the appearance of a well run establishment than making sure company polices and procedures are being followed by all managers. I do enjoy the culture, the fast paced changing environment and working with young people. The hardest part of my job was trying to insure our guests had a enjoyable time while being forced to run with a limited staff. The most enjoyable part of my job was when you could change someones day with a great meal and excellent service."
bad,"While I definitely learned how to be a better manager, much of this came from me growing personally. I was shorted on my training, HR is a joke, and promises were made from the beginning that were not met even after 7 months."
bad,"Only three out of the four manger really cared and wanted to help, the people i worked with werent the nicest the whole thing was more like high school but i was being payed to be there. One manger basically said my co-workers thought i was mean because i didn't like to talk very much. Other than that very few coworkers helped me, and the three other mangers did their best to see me succeeded."
bad,"We experience a lot of turnover and hire unreliable people who cant show up for work. In return, other people have to pick up their slack. Managers are unorganized, the restaurants constantly out of items, clientele is ridiculous, coworkers have attitudes. overall just a terrible and unenjoyable work experience."
bad,Stressed all day not much is appreciated management has no game plan they always want u to work and help the next guy everyday for no extra pay or thanks
bad,"Since I've been there, the company/food as a whole has really gone down. I wouldn't go eat there as a customer, and definitely would not recommend anyone I know to work there."
bad,New store  things getting stolen everywhere. Night crew is filthy. No gloves worn  no one washes there hands  just wipe them on dirty towels. I loved my job  until I stuck up for myself  with all the men . hours cut  being sent home don't work a full shift  production being changed everyday  by three different mangers   who cant agree on anything  . I could sit here all day and the story's would be enjoyable  but.. Its not worth spending time doing so .
bad,The OD at the time did not believe in a work life balance for managers she would get us hotel rooms so we could work more so we never saw our families
bad,"Chilis did not know what they wanted to be, ever changing leaders with ever evolving directions!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!hopeless"
bad,"What was once a great company to work for, has become a blatant cash grab operation. Little to no care for anyone not present at the boardroom table, everyone not in a suit on a day to day basis is now simply a commodity. Completely lost as to the direction of the menu, the food quality has steadily declined while prices have risen with alarming frequency. Several questionable, back scratch deciscions have lead this once great employer from prominence to middle of the pack at best."
bad,"People working were unsanitary after using the restroom. They would treat everyone like garbage and make very inappropriate jokes. I was constantly promised a chef position but when the position became available, they told me that they never intended to hire me as cook."
bad,"The atmosphere in Chilis was not what I expected and many customers did not tip. Some of the other servers were rude, but the managers did their job well at the branch I was at."
bad,"its chili's... good money for a typical college student. flexible work hours. management is terrible, but what do you expect. be prepared to spend the better half of your night running frantically around wondering if anything is getting done or if you're the only server in the whole restaurant."
bad,"Just another restaurant, but the upside is that they have great benefits. Optional healthcare, discounts with the company and they will even help pay for school tuition."
bad,chili's needs improvement on all levels. I truly hope that a new CEO takes a look at all of their restaurants and how they are doing. Goodluck to anyone working there.
bad,The job is pretty straight forward. The pay really is not good but for a summer job you can't complain too much. The tips is what you get as bulk pay.
bad,"Very youthful atmosphere typical to a restaurant culture. Professionalism is not a value that is imposed. Not consistent with expectations. Fun to gain regular customers that request you, looks good for you, the manager and the store."
bad,"what I learned from this job is to do your own work and don't worry about others, don't depend on others to help you, always check out, don't let anyone insult your intelligence"
bad,"A great experience working with a team, but overall a bad time to be working for the company, as it had started to decline."
bad,"By far the most unorganized restaurant I've ever worked in. The whole staff was lazy. Food would come out wrong, late, and or scattered on a daily basis. Servers would stand around doing nothing. Constant miss greets and upset customers. Managers were no where to be found most of the time.Only a week and half advance notice was given before store shut down. When it came to transferring, other stores were already overstaffed. Worst part is I was hired 2 months before closure, with them knowing."
bad,In the training part there is such disorganization. The managers dont communicate with one another. The general manager is excellent but I do not know about the others.
bad,"This is a good way to make extra cash but the management there is awful. They preach that they schedule off of work sales but really schedule based off of who they like better. I've went from have six days to having 2 writhin the next week it is not consistent!! The managers there are inappropriate and RUDE. Save your time and go apply elsewhere, I couldn't stay here for more than 3 months."
bad,It is great for students or anyone that is looking or something with flexible hours.  The issue comes when the server is not capable of multitasking.  Any restaurant is a high stress environment and anyone looking to be in the business should have patience and have a positive mindset if you are going to survive a shift here.
bad,"Hard work very long and mind numbing. Would not recommend working there if you having experienced cooking. Good pay, hard work, fast paced."
bad,"As a hostess, your job is to seat guests, bus tables, and answer the phone, roll silverware. You don't get a lot of training before the person you shadow gets bored and leaves you alone. You also don't get a break. EVER. Management doesn't work together. One will tell you one thing, another tells you something completely different."
bad,Its was super long hour. i was placed in a very rough area. the resturaunt was very dirty and not well managed. Not really socially acceptable place. very one way place all the upper mangers are friends.
bad,Company is mainly concerned with ratings so they can receive recognition from higher ups. They claim to be concerned with your individual goals but it becomes evident quickly that that is not the case.
bad,"I have heard good things about Chili's in the past, but the location that I chose to work at was terrible. There is way too much emphasis on the numbers, and clear favoritism for the servers who bring in the high scores on the surveys. One of the servers was favored by bosses even though he consistently showed up to work high, was rude to all the employees including the hosts and kitchen staff, and even sexually harassed most of the female servers. I made a complaint to my manager about him and was basically told ""that's just the way he is"" and there was nothing she could do about it. "
bad,"Most enjoyable part is the staff.  They are the best part about this job and are very hard workers. Management is not organized, does not look after their employees or their needs. Hardest part is having a life outside of his job because of high turnover rates and they tend to take advantage of employees who seem to be excelling."
bad,"I have always enjoyed the restaurant industry, its where I have my roots. The last few years Chili's has gone through many management and policy changes. Unfortunately not everyone has been on the same pages with these changes, which has made for difficulties in the work place. I prefer to follow policies and achieve for change as I believe said policies are there to improve the restaurant in all aspects. I respect many of my co-workers but Chili's is no longer a good fit for me."
bad,"Store suffers from poor management and lack of maturity/ professional discretion in multiple facets. Other than that, Its a great place to work during the busy season as a server. Growing with this store is not recommended though."
bad,The company has changed for the worse over the past 7 years.  They have taken away all budgeting for support staffing and asked management to pick up all support staff as well as management rolls.  Each shift we are supposed to work every hourly function as well as develop our team members and build the top line sales.  We often find that there is never enough time in the 12 hour days to complete managerial duties as well as the hourly functions that we are needing to do in order to keep the shifts running and the food going out of the windows.
bad,"I was a 9 year employee of this company.  Everyday was different and a new challenge.  The co workers I had, on site, were great.  Over time, I learned many skills of the profession."
bad,Work with no breaks in a 90+ degree kitchen. Often short handed. Management more likely to laugh at a problem then seek solution. Was asked to lie on anonymous management review and was watched to ensure the lie happened.
bad,"You definitely know who favorites are there. unless you've been there like 8 years you wont get respect there. Management is very unprofessional there and treated me poorly. They gave me dirty looks, talked to me like I was Stupid. When I first worked there I heard horrible things about the management and that should have been a sign first. The ones that were there longer were absolutely horrible to me. I WILL NOT recommend that place to anyone."
bad,They would have you come in at weird times and you would have no idea what time you were leaving. It was hard to make appointments or have any schedule. I also got told at my orientation and had paper work that said I would be making $8.00 and hour and was paid $7.25 the whole time I was employed there.
bad,I was not only a waitress I also worked in the kitchen and sometimes in the bar. I did not see my management trying to help anyone excel further in the Chili's company. So I took it upon myself to further myself by learning every aspect of the job.
bad,Long hours with  little appreciation.  You are only a number.
bad,Chili's has a quality of life statement that is never followed. They allow less labor than I have ever seen before. All the team members are always stressed out. I wouldn't recommend unless you are desperate.
bad,A typical day working at chilis as a hostess included seating customers and maintaining the reservation list . The enjoyable part is the interaction with customers including regulars the hard part is dealing with the large crowds and maintaining the wait list.
bad,I had many challenges and roles throughout my time.
bad,"rotating shift with different days off every week, different start times and often split days off. Company refused to flex my work schedule so I could go to school for IT training, even though they wouldn't be paying for it."
bad,"Line cook, cooking cleaning and prep work. very busy, long orders, worked til 2 am."
bad,A typical day would be going through my section and making sure it was clean and set. Sometimes relieving a server for break. Making sure thing in the kitchen is prepared with items that will be used during the shift.
bad,The most enjoyable part of the job was greeting the regular customers.
bad,Deberían pagar mejor al housekeeping porque es es mucho trabajo y la paga está muy abajo por eso la gente no dura
bad,"The management is nice, but the hours are long and the job is hard. I was working 50+hour weeks when I told them I needed no more then 30 a week due to chronic illness. Lots of doubles, no breaks. Customers are very mean. Not rude, straight up mean and hateful. I've been spit on, yelled at, called names and the serving staff is just as rude. They have cliques like highschoolers, and make fun on everyone. I was made fun of for having diabetes and a miscarriage, and made fun of for being chubby too."
bad,"Worked this job to earn money during my junior year of high school, wasn't the best but wasn't the worst either. I was a host but was frequently called to do other tasks like bus tables and food run."
bad,The company needs a new ipdated computer syster especially since almost every order is special. Also not all the managers talk to you and are very rude.
bad,"They have a good kitchen lay- out, great on cleanliness, good training but no advancement opportunities or raises. "
bad,The company expects you to  finish 9 tasks at the same time while simultaneously taking a minimum of 4 tables at the same time and the management refuses to help.
bad,"There was never enough help. Company had extreme turnover problems. The equipment was always in need of repair. Because of the high turnover, no one was ever trained."
bad,"I worked for Chilii’s for over a decade. At first the company was great! However, over time things changed, and NOT FOR THE BETTER. They say you will have a 50 hour work week. That is a lie, they will work you 12 hour shifts, until you are completely exhausted. 6, sometimes 7 days a week. There is VERY LITTLE room for advancement (unless you are in “the club”.  So you had better be good at be good at brown nosing. ONE of the worst aspects of this job is the unrealistic expectation s they have about labor cost. You will be forced to work with a skeleton crew. Who picks up the slack? You will, you will be doing everything from washing dishes, unloading trucks, doing prep, waiting tables, cooking, pull thaw...I could go on and on! In addition to performing all of these “hourly” tasked, you will still need to do all of your management duties.  Which will involve a lot of unnecessary busywork. They continually pile on more and more tasks, which will make “managing” a restaurant extremely difficult. Yes, the pay is very competitive...but YOU WILL WORK VERY HARD to earn it. Forget about a social life, and sleep. Some days it was impossible to even get 5-6 hours of sleep before you need too be back. I worked at many different locations, and one thing was the same....the GM will work most of the day shifts, and nother management will be stuck closing an unfair amount of shifts. I finally escaped this company. Please don’t be fooled by the dream they will sell you! However, if you like A LOT OF STRESS in your life, this company will definitely deliver!!!"
bad,"I really enjoyed working there, but a lot of things happened that didn't sit well with me. My coworkers were awesome but the scheduling was garbage and the management rarly took responsibility for unfair practices."
bad,geeat place to work but corporate restaurants do things in a weird way. that i dont really think is fair you get tables bases on your survey scores and statting new it doesnt really give you a chance to work your way up
bad,"It’s a good job for teens trying to make money. Fast dining can be made beneficial but a lot of customers that eat at Chili’s are extremely cheap and will stiff the server. At times you will end up with a $150 bill and your tip will be $5. Don’t shy away from it if you are looking for extra cash but as a server at Chili’s in Miami, you most certainly will not make a living. "
bad,"Chili’s just ehh.  Like the management is poor.  Extremely, and they let too much of the wrong things go on , i  mean the pay is decent but you know thy just ehh."
bad,"waiting tables, getting food ready to send out, bussing tables. greeting people at the door and seating them. cleaning the front of house. the hardest part of my job was not making enough money to live. the most enjoyable part of my job was the people I worked with."
bad,"Over time work daily without any rewards (11 hour+)"
bad,"Los gerentes no te dan apoyo, no incentivan a sus trabajadores. Los pagos son impuntuales y menos de lo que deben de pagar"
bad,"Worked very hard there for a year. Worked harder than any job i've ever had (i've been working in the restaurant business for quite a while now). And surprisingly i've lived off minimum wage for almost the entire year, until i told them about a raise at the end which it felt like they were giving it to me reluctantly. Besides that, coworkers were nice."
bad,Some of the management at the franchise was alright. The general manager that I worked for as well as the area director I felt were not sure of how to get the restaurant into a better place. They were down in sales by a significant amount and had poor scores. I had a clear idea of how I would go about turning the restaurant into a shining jewel. I felt as though my ideas were ignored by my GM and then after a few months we would cycle back around to the ideas I had suggested and felt as though he took credit for it. The Chili's that I worked for was part of a franchise and not a Brinker controlled restaurant.
bad,"Working by yourself on holidays, without a lunch or a break is not acceptable, yeah other employees might be ok with that but it is wrong and illegal. It does not boost moral, and being treated less than by the waiting staff is a slap in the face. Just because you’re a dishwasher doesn’t mean you deserve to be treated like less than."
bad,"was very fast paced. hosts aren't on tip share so you gotta slave for the servers for free. If you get hired as a host, they aren't gonna make you a server so leave while you can."
bad,Worked there a while back. The beginning of my stint working for Chili's was great. But when the original management team left and the new management came in is when all the problems seemed to arise. Managers not knowing that employees are working double shifts and try to write people up for not being clean on the second shift. Managers trying to write people up for an employee calling out 8 hours before their shift because their wife was having a baby. Just sad that it went downhill like that.
bad,"Somewhat flexible with hours but also demanding of time. Only flexible with class schedule requiring weekend or night shift work. Open late. Hourly wage plus tips, tips are minimal during the school year because dining dollars can be used to purchase meals. Great work environment young staff, mostly students who attend western carolina university."
bad,"When I began working at Chili's, I spoke with one specific manager who was very understanding of my school schedule and my living location. I explained my schedule and the hours I was able to work. Once he left,the other manager in charge of our shifts was unwilling to bear any of the employee's outside lives in mind, over-scheduled the majority of us current employees, created a very hostile work environment and left us feeling incredibly undervalued."
bad,Chili's praises the phrase life is short work happy but does not practice it. Unless you are a favorite of the leader ship team you have  little chance to advance despite your skills and results. They do not provide a training program for new GM's which results in failure a good part of the time. Have met many great team members and fellow managers during my tenure who look to move on due to these conditions.
bad,Working with this company proved  to be little to no benefit for me as an overall person. Ran by a poor management team and very sloppy. Team members can be working together well at one point in time and then at another it turns into a storm.
bad,They feed you to the wolves. If you never had restaurant experience don't go here cause they do not give you enough training time. Like I got 4 hours of training then they threw me on the floor on a Saturday night all by myself.
bad,"Not a livable wage and I'm not paid enough to put up with half the stuff I do put up with. Two out of three managers are bearable individuals but sometimes, when you're looking for a manager to be calm, cool, and collected, you find someone about to have a tantrum."
bad,"laid back environment , do what's needed leave the rest."
bad,"great place to work for at first , no one works together all working for something different ..left for better place to work . loved it at first when they first opened ,,,now ?? no"
bad,"Never have i worked somewhere where absolutely no body wanted to work together. It felt like highschool cliques between certain employees and managers. I experienced managers talk about employees, which, in my belief, is beyond unprofessional. I watched employees literally be bullied and no one cared."
bad,Chilis are pretty different all around. I've worked at two location and you just have to find the one that you fit into. 5/10 experience due to favoritism and other reasons.
bad,"My day consisted of picking up after and managing my co workers.It was an impossible work enviroment =, it was stressfull in all the wrong ways and there was no where to move up to without being a company manager and even with that, it was a small improvement. I typically plated food, stocked the hot line, ran food, and communicated between front and back of house to ensure food went out quickly and efficiently. the most enjoyable part of my job would have to be me being accountable and or directly part of the restaurant running well, it was all on my shoulders. The most difficult part of my job was having to take the blame for others mistakes."
bad,Typical server job. Take care of guests. Take orders. Run food and drinks. Handle money. Always keeping a smile on your face and handling difficult situations.
bad,This is good place to work while you're in school or training for another job. They are flexible and willing to work with your schedule. The people there are willing to help.
bad,It was a great place to work and had great coworkers. When new management came in they took the fun out of the job and made it miserable place to work.
bad,"This is a good place for college students and high school kids to work. Your job is based on a survey if you serve. Its a totally inaccurate survey. Chilis has potential to be a great company but their desire for profit causes them to overwork their employees. No bussers on busy nights and yet cleanliness is pushed. Team service is pushed but with all the server responsibilities its impossible to do them all. Chilis rips off their employees. They are not concerned with quality of life, only profit. They say they want to create the best life but its not true. The turn over rate is high because the quality of life is low. I love my co workers. It seems like some of them could run the store better than the greedy people in corporate. Your employees need benefits Brinker!!!!! Give them a reason to work harder!!! Stop the survey  because its not an accurate depiction. Put some cameras in the store, and put gratuity on those large tables. Your employees are suffering!!!!!!! Since the gem survey started my tips have gone down. I make less because im surrounded by servers who cant focus because they are scared of getting bad scores. I worked at a store that had great scores but their comps were thru the roof. So is the survey really accurate?"
bad,"Awful place to work. The employees well the servers all hate each other and are only out for themselves and are super rude to the host me at most times. If you are in a great mood you really won't be leaving out after shift. Under staffed, messes up sleep patterns with long hours, and almost no breaks it feels like never again will I pick this place"
bad,"Work was always fast moving, usually understaffed.  Money is solid, but far from spectacular. Tough to live a structured life with such variance in hours."
bad,"A typical day at work starts off with greeting fellow employees and finding out about changes, if any, that have been made or promotions that any servers should know about.  The hardest part of the job in my opinion would be, ensuring that you maintain a positive attitude and are as accommodating as possible with unhappy customers and being unable to please them.  The most gratifying part of my job as a server is giving outstanding service to a customer that allows their meal to be more than just a meal, but a great dining experience."
bad,"didn't like working here, not good enough pay, poor management, just wasn't a great place to work."
bad,Learned how to perfect good customer service during this job. Co-workers were friendly. Not good at working as a team though.
bad,I was hired as a host/ service assistant. I would escort customers to their table and get them set up while they waited for their server. I also cleaned tables when we got a heavy flow of customers. Servers were always unprofessional and inconsiderate of the customer
bad,it can be fun but it has some its down sides. its a little unorganized
bad,The managers are running my particular store into the ground. They have a few favorites who can break all the rules and eat for free.  Those favorites are also responsible for schedule making and training so you can see how some might benefit from the job while others barely see a good shift.  
bad,"Althoug you are compensated fairly, the constant changes in operations and policy is crazy. If you are brought in with advancement as a selling point beware."
bad,My day normally began with light cleaning and seating the early lunch crowd. As the day progressed the establishment would have its normally scheduled happy hour/dinner rush. I had been a hostess prior to working at Chili's so there was nothing new to learn. My co-workers were nice but a bit on edge from time to time. Management was usually in shambles and unorganized but normally had good intentions. The best thing I got out of this job was a long term friend and the tried and true knowledge that working for a chain restaurant is not the best place for me.
bad,"A day at work for me is never typical. My main thing is the money isnt consistent and you constantly are dealing with alot of rude people. In the Chili's atmosphere the ""customer is always right"" and in some instances this can turn a good day at work bad very quickly. I enjoy my job but at times it feels like the management team is more so looking out for themselves instead of what is really right. I have been with the company for over four years and things for me are just seeming to get worse before they get better."
bad,"A typical day at work seemed long and was uninteresting. I learned how the back side of a restaurant basically functions. My managers were mostly introverted and grumpy, and most of my co-workers did not speak English. The hardest part of the job was when we were understaffed, and so by default, my shift always seemed to be extended. The most enjoyable part was honestly just knowing that I was making money."
bad,I enjoy my job as llng as there is no manager around. I work well with my fellow employees and i am very efficient and prficient in what i do. When a manager tries to change the methods having never worked with them it disrupts the flow of business and causes chaos within the work environment. I also feel that the hardest working employees are never given the recognition they deserve.
bad,The employees did not get along. There was cussing and hostility and just not a place I can see myself working. I was treated horribly. the only thing that I enjoyed doing was working for the customers and serving the public.
bad,"I enjoyed working at Chili's starting off but, as time pasted by it became an hard job. The reason I say that because, the coworkers (other hosts) wouldn't want to do their job. They would always be on the phone the whole shift not tending to customers. I pretty much had to do most of the stuff."
bad,A typical bday at work starts off great pretty smooth also steady I like interacting with people managers are usually helping customers or talking to customer about experiences
bad,It started out great I got along with my co-workers just fine for the most part. Over time once promoted my hours got cut shorter and shorter. Management did nothing and guests were often disrespectful.
bad,"Quick turnover, corporate doesnt care about employees just the bottom line. Lack of communication throughout managers. Recently there is an added element and no compensation. My tips have been reduced by more than half because of the added outside delivery service."
bad,"Management didn't know how to schedule shifts. I left because it was a literal waste of time to work there. Also, they do not care about their staff at all."
bad,"Chilis Inglewood is a very stressful job to be working for, but the tips and paycheck say otherwise. chilis in Inglewood is one if not the biggest and most busiest franchise they own in California. and they totally are. team workers are very dramatic, share to many information and some are friendly who just go in and make their money and head out... 95% Of employees are stressed out of their minds and the other 5% is management."
bad,"I really enjoyed the staff and had a lot of fun working late nights and feeling like a part of a little family. Everyone was quick to help me learn the new order taking system and all went well - it is hard to get help on an evening rush; there is sort of a fend for yourself mentality that only gets people yelled at via management. I had complications in the beginning of my pregnancy and after needing some time off to handle them, my boss told me I was too unreliable and took me off the schedule until I just quit. Mind you, I was their lead opening and closing waitress, I unloaded the truck, and trained new employees. My brother-in-law passed and I took a week off to travel to identify his body with my husband. And by complication I mean I had a partial miscarriage and lost one of my twins at the end of my 1st trimester so I was mandated a good amount of time off by a doctor. Unreliable."
bad,"During the week they only have 1 host that greets, buses, wipes, and seats every guest. Constantly overwhelming. Servers don't do much to help out with cleaning after their tables."
bad,Management did not really care for the place. They honestly tried to show that they did but it was always a complete mess in there with new people who did not care for their jobs.
bad,I didn't mind the job so much but when the day gets busy it seems that your coworkers and management staff are of no help and then later get on your tail for it. There is a lack of respect and communication and the overall place is unorganized and uncoordinated.
bad,Wouldn't hire the proper staff to do the job effectively. Working split shifts. Work at 8 a.m to 3 p.m come back at 5 p.m. and work til 10 p.m. Understaffed and very stressful
bad,"Everybody that I worked with was fantastic including management but even after asking for a promotion to an official server position I was ignored and taken advantage of I feel like. I was a host for the entire year and 2 months that I worked there which was extremely unfair because I worked harder than all of the hosts combined and even harder than some of the servers. I got promoted to To-Go but it was so slow that most days I just picked up the server's slack and brought food out for them, without EVER getting a single tip from the servers. It was to the point where if I was promoted to server, they would not have had to train me. "
bad,Poor management. Managers avoid issues/hide from employees. Never fix any issues within the running of the store. Does not work around family schedule.
bad,"The new system really screwed me over and I do not make nearly as much as I did. This job does not provide me with what I need. I learned to multi task and run around everywhere for low pay. Management is okay, but you have to tell them what you want instead of them telling you that you are moving up."
bad,Took advantage of good employees left employees hanging when needing help while managers would stand there and watch never offering help and expecting you to have job done in timely fashion
bad,"Like I said, the managers were really fair and they made you feel like you can make it. Yet, when it came to the kitchen crew they made you feel like you were an outsider. I did not feel like I belonged."
bad,"After working at Chili's for about a year and a half, I got to see the ins and outs of how the restaurant ran, and I realized that it was a very toxic environment to work in. Perhaps it was the staff I had as coworkers, who often had drama surrounding them and it got in the way of us doing our jobs. The management turnover was pretty high because the restaurant wasn't doing so well, at least in the one I worked at. The managers would send servers home too early, and then the inevitable rush would come and guests would get bad service because we were low-staffed. Overall, our interactions with each other just weren't that great. It was stressful, at times emotionally draining, but the money was pretty good depending on the day. I got a lot of experience out of working there, that's for sure, but I was really happy to leave, if I'm being honest."
bad,Chili's is ok but not the greatest place to work. At the rio rancho location you can make good money if you work at it. The staff is not all friendly by a long shot.
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of atleast 4- hours of being on your feet. Every manager I had throughout this job was immature and feed into the worker drama. Unfair biases and judgments about me were made by both the management and the team members. The general manager was and continued to remain unfriendly, intimidating and uninviting during the year and a half I worked for this company. one manager in particular upheld innapropriate confrontations with her employees and still continues to be a part of the company. Hours and employment were dependent on the intent to return surveys that guests had the option to fill out. I dealt with alot of immature adults however I also made good relationships with a few of my other workers."
bad,"met many nice people and co-workers, but the management was unfair and very lazy. i did'nt like that they used the kiosk to determine when and if you even get more shifts. i hate that if the food sucks and it is not the servers fault but the cooks, the servers still get blamed and also get shifts taken from them. i hate that the management gets trained to serve, bartend, cook, QA, and togo, and still don't help with anything ever."
bad,Management and service was good but the other employees were not so great. I was a hostess and when I sat people in their section they were furious and they had no problem letting you know it.
bad,It could be stressful working there as the general manager was not the friendliest person to work with. Other than that it was a great place to work.
bad,"The pay sounded awesome until I saw the dish pit and the amount of work they expect. First of all, there was no 3compartment sink. Just a tiny scraping area and the worst/dirtiest dish machine I have ever seen. With nowhere to let the dishes soak, the job becomes tedious. On busy nights it is just plain ridiculous. They expect you to do everything a dishwasher is usually expected to do but on top of that you have to pick up any slack from the cooks. Many nights while closing I would be ahead of my schedule and I would have to help the cooks pre-close, meanwhile, when the cooks finished early, they would just leave while I had to finish everything myself. Don't let the high pay trick you into working here. NO AMOUMT OF MONEY IS WORTH THE STRESS!"
bad,"I learned the way a multi unit chained restaurant operated. Brinker was the leader in corporate  Restaurants. We had the latest  tecknowlege in prep sheets, p-mix tracking, liquor tracking. This helped me learn more about controllable cost."
bad,"I worked my butt off and did more work than my job title and didn't get recognition, and when I asked for a raise, management said no."
bad,A day at chili's was steady but no busy enough for me. So you lose sight on what the real goal is. I learned how to be a better waitress at my current job. My management was strict but not very helpful to farther my job skills. My employer weren't very friendly or family oriented.   Hardest part of my job I wasn't happy there.
bad,With the continuous cutting of position and hours working at Chili's has become increasingly stressful and taking care of the guest on the level that the company requires is very difficult.
bad,The kitchen staff was principled by the health services. The manager team was strict on staff with understanding problem solving methods. Hours were good through out working week and also the pay. I would come in the morning prepping what the kitchen needed before setting up and cooking for my station. When the order screen began filling up I know the store has open.
bad,"very busy and not very organized kitchen, had to be on both sides FOH and BOH at the same time"
bad,"I enjoyed working for chillis for the most part. It was a very fun job. I liked my co workers and management alot. However, the pay was not very well and there were no real benifits. Also they tend to not promote people. I had to work at a different restaurant to become a manager. The same was also true for alot of my co workers. The company seems to want to hire managers from outside the company."
bad,"I was a hostess and it was terrible. We had no bussers so not only did we have to seat people but we also had to bus tables and the servers were lazy and entitled and would leave tables full of dishes. On busy nights its absolutely horrible. Although when you had good servers the job was decent. "
bad,"nothing special. good to get by for a little. Pay is based on the culture around the restaraunt. Our typical customers do not tip very well, where other chili places get better pay. Too fast paced for too little pay"
bad,Over the period of time i worked there it only got worser everyone began quiting because of horrible management bad communication towards one another & bad reviews on the whole restaraunt
bad,"At Chili's you will be taking care of the most low-class of guests. Many of them are either poor or are too cheap to tip. since it is a basic chain restaurant, decent tips. But if you are a surprisingly very good server, you will see yourself get some very good tips. but never can you avoid the low class cheepos"
bad,"toxic work environment. Everyone expected you to help them especially servers when they asked, but if you asked for help on something they'd tell you to find someone else. Everyone would talk behind your back here, not specifically me, but about other people in general. "
bad,"good job for expanding work experience, however management was not very stable. Not an environment I would recommend if you are a sensitive person co-workers and customers can be extremely harsh."
bad,I did not enjoy my job at chilis. It was very stressful and the managers treated me poorly. I was the youngest employee and I felt that I did not receive the same treatment as the older employees.
bad,"I had issues with the area manager, the lady who was area a manger was demoted and had lots of anger issues and would take it out on the employees. She would tell everyone she hated it there and didn’t like us."
bad,It could be great places to work. Not all chili's are not the same because the chili's where i started frist it was a great places the manger was real down to earth
bad,"At chilis you are expected to host as well s buss tables. However, like at most restaurants you get a tip at the end of the night. At Chili's, you do not get a tip out even though you buss."
bad,"As a hostess I learned to manage time better to accommodate the restaurant, but it also helped in my personal life. I regret to say my experience here was not a good one. Management and employees were unorganized and on edge. The hardest part for me was having to deal with people who lost their temper; customers and employees alike."
bad,"A typical day at work is not consistent, You will not know when you are scheduled till."
bad,Management was very spiteful. Shifts are based off of numbers from a survey a child can fill out or fellow servers fill out their own surveys to get shifts - all because that's what their bonus is based of off.
bad,"Opening and closing the store is mostly easy. It was just the managers that made the day hard. Some where new , young and still needed more experience. Other just felt like they had other things to worry about other than their employees problems. The co-workers were fun to work with. Good people. The brand is a good brand to work for but the managers at this store have more to work on."
bad,"Working for this company has not been the best experience for me, It is very unorganized and the management team is not the best. The people there are amazing, getting along with the guest and co-workers are the best parts about the job."
bad,"The management is horrible and unorganized. One of my managers tried to hit on me, one always seemed high, one was pretty cool but got aggravated if you needed something and the GM was rude with mood swings."
bad,Fun environment with flexible scheduling. Potential to make good money if you work hard and do your job well. Weekends are where the money is.
bad,"A typical day at work included assisting guests with an upbeat, positive attitude to ensure a pleasurable dining experience. I also  trained new employees as cocktail and floor servers. I learned the fundamentals of serving here at Chili's, and how to take care of guest needs in a restaurant setting. Management at this particular Chili's could have use a lot pf polishing. The general manager did not truly respect the servers in this restaurant, and I felt that they were not always there to back us up the way we needed them to. I did, however, really like my co-workers here at Chili's. All kinds of personalities came together and built a fun, quirky work environment. The hardest part of the job had to have been the extreme work load the servers had to deal with at times. We sometimes had to prep our own food, run the food, pre-bus lots of tables, run the to-go stand, run the host stand, and also take care of up to 10 tables at one time. The most enjoyable part of this job was the fact that I gained plenty of knowledge here about what it takes to provide for my guests, and the strong friendships I built with other co-workers. "
bad,"The customers were not always the best and the job was not the greatest. However, the management was great to work for. Very caring for their employees."
bad,I had alot of problems when working there but it was all love in the end. Its an extreme headache but if you work together everything will be okay in the end.
bad,It was a great company. I worked with a variety of coworkers and got along with everyone they're. I made decent tips and had a blast working they're . often I would pick up extra hours.
bad,A work place that would be fine for some but would not work with schedules for students and we’re not easy to talk to. Did not have set hours and was always lost on who had what shift.
bad,"Was brought into an environment where there were standards set and gradually the management and employees stopped meeting those required to provide guests and team members with a consistent, professional and productive environment and experience. Fraternization between managers, employees and area directors was a very big problem here."
bad,"Managers showed favoritism. My coworkers were extremely messy, not all of them but majority. I enjoy eating there but I will not work for Chilis and time soon."
bad,"Work hard or don’t  it doesn’t matter. Managers and team members are the same. Work your fingers to the bone 80 hours a week or party all night and sleep in the office. Nobody is held accountable, managers never ever get fired no matter what."
bad,So much needs fixed in the restaurant I had amazing regulars that made going to work enjoyable. I love people so that was also a big plus! The actual restaurant needs a lot of help
bad,"My over all experience at Chili's was poor. After 4 months of countless training and sexual harrassment modules my opinion of Chili's as a whole was low. If you have worked in the food industry for any amount of time you know that firstly fresh ingredients make the best food. I could not endorse the product when people would comment on how great it was knowing it was 80% frozen from the steaks to the ribs to the soup, even the tortillas for their tacos were routinely microwaved along with the pasta and alfredo sauce and most all hot hold items were microwaved multiple times before being served. On top of that the district training Manager was definitely not meant for the job with 0 patience and a habit of talking down to every single employee that they came in contact with, whilst throwing away hundreds of dollars of product that hadn't been labeled but had been prepared that day. As a Manager you were required to spend time washing dishes and bussing tables as well as hosting throughout your shift which is understandable from time to time as business calls for, but not 3 or 4 hours in the dish area daily on a weekly basis. So over all if I had been aware of the condition of the unit I was going to work at I would have definitely turned the job down. The GM at the unit was also a 6 month Inexperienced, emotionally motivated, side talker that was only interested total domination. I would seriously consider all your options before accepting a job Managing at Chili's."
bad,"Well I was their head cook, someone put in a false claim about me and alllll the managers know it was false but because it went to corporate I had to get terminated. So I feel their officers in cooperate should get  reevaluated. But working at the actual restaurant It's really not that bad of a place to work at. I miss it a lot , the fast paced and party platters you have to keep up with. The co workers are okay.  Pretty much everywhere you go, its the same negative things! But starting off as a cook"
bad,while working there the managers were on different pages and couldn't collaborate accordingly with one another. The lack of communication between the management and employees was horrendous. Management treated employees with disrespect.
bad,"She was not very kind to me from day one everyone said she was that way to pretty girls she felt threatened  by, well it was true, and I eventually quit because how she made me feel when she was there."
bad,You can make decent money here but the last 2 hours (especially on weekends) typically brings in the worst of the worst.  Be prepared to run harder and work more for less as your closing the restaurant.
bad,Easily I would say that this job is by far the most stressful and unorganized location and that is why I had such a hard time. The clients were rude and coworkers carried a poor attitude because of the lack of organization.
bad,the place always seemed like it was a step away from total chaos.  Communication was at an alltime low and the servers were in constant competition with eachothether
bad,"Everyday was hectic and the wage was very low. Besides, there were hardly any tips as well. Customers were occasionally rude and co-workers were not exactly appropriate as well."
bad,This is a fast paced high volume work environment with some room to advance. Friendly staff and some friendly management. hardest part of the job is being on your feet all day with not much time for breaks.
bad,"We gave waiter service, but also we have so many activities for a salary of 2.13 per hour plus the trips. However we have to gave the 1%, of our tips to the bartender and from a guys of the kitchen."
bad,"While working as a dishwasher there I wasn't able to take many breaks without them getting mad, my coworkers treated me bad by throwing dishes at me, the managers kept all the heavy dishes on the top rack above the sink and didn't move it after I told them how difficult it makes it for me and that it fell on me when I was doing dishes a couple times, when I told them the person working with me was slowing me down by not helping and just being on his phone they did nothing, the girls there were always staring at me and always trying to flirt with me and didn't stop when I told them to, the mangers and supervisors slacked off and allowed the other workers to do so as well, you can bring as much food as you want home and almost everything on the menu is free, I made a couple friends that were dishwashers as well, but they soon left the job for a better one, pays 11 per hour so I made good money, I got a lot of hours, received a award there for doing extra work, and has benefits."
bad,"I learned that people can be really really rude, and management was alright. I learned that you can get a lot done in a little amount of time. And you can make friends with anyone."
bad,I did not enjoy working here. The managers were not at all respectful or nice. The hours were very short. The pay was not acceptable as well. I would never work here again or any other food place.
bad,"The people were fun to work with. Managers withed with your schedule. The hours were not the best, and neither was the pay. You did receive discounts on your food."
bad,"Chilis is not a hard place to work. The environment is good. Working under pressure is not a strong suit for the employees there. Once busy season came about, it just went down hill. People started dropping trays on guests, messing up orders,taking the wrong food to the tables because they are not paying attention. Management not handling situations properly between employees on certain occasions."
bad,"Chilis is a restaurant, so when its busy you are all over the place, but its organized and you get lots of exercise as well as new friends and work on your people skills!"
bad,"It was a typical chain restaurant job. If you're a server, you work for tips, if you're a cook, you're hourly. Chili's is a great place to work if you're in school or on the way to something else, it puts cash in your pocket quickly and you don't really have to dedicate a lot of time to getting better at your job."
bad,"If you were to fall under requirements for the corporation seeked from a server, you'd be scheduled less. This made it difficult to get your scores back up. i felt stuck and management seemed to only care about score rather than helping employees. Other than that i did make new friends, became more outgoing and learned many new server skills."
bad,"low pay , low tips, tip out percentage..not too much to say perfect for highschool students need a job. area is tips good SOMETIMES! I cant say too much only been there for like 5 months"
bad,Too many hours and not enough pay for that tasks that they require you to do. The turnover rate was high and the culture that was established was not good.
bad,"You expect stress when working in a restaurant, but not like this. I tried to hold out while the new manager tried to make improvements but there are some things that can't be fixed."
bad,chiis was a very difficult place to work all the pressure of guest that dont realize you are a person and no matter what they are always right managers suck
bad,"Stressful, but fun. There's a lot of amanzing people to work with. I think you only get a break if you work double shifts. Working in the back you get a free meal, if you work up front you get half off."
bad,"I understand this job is extremely stressful at times but the management didnt really seem to care that much about whether the guests were being fair to the employees. They are all about teamwork and helping each other out but when it comes down to it, you are on your own."
bad,"fun, exciting , great place to work; great atmosphere, awesome staff; great, busy location;  Great company, values employees; never had trouble taking time off when needed"
bad,Not everyone is cut out for this place. It is very fast pace and you have got to keep up or will get behind resulting in upset guests\managers. Most of the time you didn't get a break until you were actually off for the day.
bad,"Poor conditions of prep areas lead to slower and less quality service . Working at Chilis,  I'm positive I'll never eat there again."
bad,This was probably my least favorite job for many reasons. The management was unbelievable. Everyone was related too so if you werent part of the family you were always wrong like no other. It was crazy
bad,The lazy workers are the ones who get everything they want. If you show that you are a hard worker they will squeeze as much out of you as they possibly can. They say that they care about you but they really don't. The pay isn't worth all the headache and hassle from other employees who are on drugs most of the time.
bad,once the grill was removed from the kitchen it was no longer a place that took skill to work at. The managers were lazy which caused the staff to lack any motivation to perform at the best of their ability's.
bad,the laziest crew i have ever worked with in my life. everyone conplained about everything and nothing would ever get accomplished.
bad,"Managers seemed to not communicate with each other, staff definitely wouldn't communicate with each other,  causing too much stress."
bad,It was OK working at Chilis. It was my first serving job and i learned how to wait tables but management was awful. would not recommend working there.
bad,working at chilis was an experience. I was good at my job and the task was easy to do. Working there made me realize that i wanted to do something that would challenge me more.
bad,Management plays favorites.  Need I say more?  I enjoyed the other servers I worked with.  I did not feel like they provided their employees with enough work.
bad,Greeting customers as they walk in. Seating them at certain places around the restaurant. Learned how to talk to a group of customers at one time. Co-workers were fun to be with.
bad,"it was always busy, learned more about giving well customer service, the management was okay but needed to be stronger and more involved, my co-workers were good, just to stressful at times and it was unorganized. just enjoyed putting a smile on a customers face"
bad,"Manager Marnie was always yelling and overwhelmed. Over hired when they had servers who were requesting more hours, and thus compensation was inadequate. ""Incentives"" used were somewhat insulting to anyone who needed income or considered themselves an adult (i.e. plastic party favors appropriate for children)."
bad,The job wasn't enjoyable. The manager's acted as if they were above everyone and belittled the people who were not managers.
bad,"Cool people to work with. However, managers are only worried about their bonus."
bad,Chilis Bar & Grill. Restaurant & Bar. Fast/Casual cuisine.
bad,There is no break. People can be rude and ignorant. I learn that working in a reatuarant is not for me.
bad,this company is highly uptight the management is awful and i do not feel like a part of any team.
bad,accurately take orders from customers and deliver food in time manner
bad,"Very mismanaged company to work for. No one really knows what's going on. No one in management communicates with each other. It was better when I worked in Nacogdoches, NOT San Antonio. "
bad,"favoritism need new management this is the store in portland, texas"
bad,I have learned a lot about interacting with customers and making sure the experience was unlike any other. I greet customers and make sure they have a great time while spending a few hours with me. I have made many friends and regulars who frequent my shifts in order to see me. The Chili's standard is like many thriving businesses and the fellow staff members made it a fantastic place to work. Management has tried to keep pace but has failed to stay with this restaurant standard. Rules are always stretched and the hardest part of my job was getting a consistent standard across each shift. I enjoy interacting with customers and making sure they have a memorable experience. Chili's has given me a lot of experience but I am ready to move on.
bad,"check in, get to work. very hands on. not much standng still somebody will always need something or help so its very busy"
bad,-Provide guests with excellent customer service
bad,Promoción no es efectiva solo a amigos cercanos y no en base a capacidades o aptitudes.
bad,"I enjoyed Working there, work life balance was key to me being able to work two jobs. I made great money because of my customer service. I enjoyed talking to people all the time and that being my job!"
bad,"The coworkers and managers at this store are awesome. Unfortunately the compensation just cannot match the work environment. The main problem is the slow season (late fall until mid spring) it just isn't enough money, even when close to full time. That and pressure from the higher ups to maintain certain levels of scores and credit card payments on ziosks."
bad,"Fast paced restaurant. Family like team. Learned how to balance 6 to 8 tables at a time. Management is very encouraging, fun and supportive. Coworkers are the best. Hardest part of the job is how packed the place can get. 8 tables can be tough so you HAVE to work fast and be specific wit customer needs. Tips here are awesome but the best part is my family/ coworkers."
bad,"Very good with hours, management makes you feel like you're part of a family instead of a work drone. Great benefits. Flexible schedule, so it's perfect for a college student like myself. Very fast-paced so it's never boring, therefore, if you're the type that's lazy and hates working, this job is not for you. I'm really close with the servers and other staff, so it's makes team work a lot easier and the environment more fun. You get promoted very easily and training is easygoing and efficient when you move up. You also meet a lot of amazing and pleasant customers. it's honestly the best job that I've ever had so far. I love it."
bad,"Love who I worked with but hated who came in.  People walked there checks, stiffed you or worse leave you change for no reason.  I could work from 2 to 10 and you work, there is a tone of side work and tests and rules and regulations.  If you like working your but off then this is the place for you."
bad,4-5 hour shifts unless you are a bartender. You walk out with cash. Every day is unpredictable.
bad,"Chilis was a fast pace and most time intense work environment, it was great until I had children and then the 65 hour work weeks were not conducive to the home life that I needed to lead."
bad,"I met some great co workers during my time at chillis. The real problem was management, I went through 7 different managers in one year which is ridiculous. If your lucky enough to find a manager that lasts more than 4 moths I would recommend it."
bad,"It's a great place to make quick cash and the people you work with are very fun. The job is very competitive, stressful, and the management struggles to get the restaurant running smoothly. It was enjoyable in the beginning, but now it is no longer fun."
bad,Had to deal with much of unwanted drama.  The environment is unprofessional.  Would not go back to working here.
bad,"The money is good if you are a good server. The management is horrible. They think that you have no say in anything and that your opinions don't matter. Alot of the servers complain and don't want to be at work. The job is very easy, but when you have to deal with everything else, it becomes a problem."
bad,"Working at was a good work environment. compensation really was inadequate, and was not opportunities for advancement"
bad,"I loved working the chill's over 10 year, We had a lot of changers, But when we loss Great leader, It all was started from the top. OVER 4 menu changes in 6 months"
bad,"Chilis was a great place to work .  You learn hard work and have fun at the same time.  I was able to become lead trainer and move into management.  Honestly the hardest part about managing in a restaurant is the age and mentality of the people that work in this atmosphere as most are still very young and think it is just another restaurant job.  It is hard to get everyone focused on the common goal and that is to make sure our customers are happy,  keep it clean and stay focused.  I enjoyed my job as lead trainer as I was able to create schedules, give orientations, and most importantly I was able to run our charity events for Saint Jude's Children's Hospital.  The environment at any Chili's is so diverse which I believe keeps you grounded and also makes you become aware of how to work with different personalities.  I believe I walked into the establishment everyday and greeted a new employee.  I showed them how to start out the day, walked them around, showed table numbers, and taught them the menu.  I showed the new employees tricks on how to memorize the menu so they would always send it to the kitchen correctly and keep organization and multitasking a key goal.  It was definitely an enlightening experience and taught me how to be personable and organized.  Always meeting new people was a big plus."
bad,Not bad if you're about that life. Good management and nice coworkers. But the people that go to eat there are rude. The system of scores is not worth the stress. Making people fill out the survey for the sake of your section.... PASS! and I worked there for about three years. Maintained decent scores but annoying overall.
good,Los gerentes no saben separar lo personal de lo laboral se ensañan mucho si alguien les cae mal seria un excelente lugar para trabajar si tubiera lideres mejor preparados
good,Not a place I would recommend unless it’s your first job . The workers don’t get paid enough to do what they have too . Too many rules not enough if any benefits are provided
good,The people that work with me are all the times taking smoke breaks and not wanting to do the job.  And they leave before all the job is done so that leaves me working alone and staying 12 hours or more
good,The atmosphere was ok at first but quickly realized that behind the scenes there was a lot of favoritism and backstabbing that make the workplace uneasy most of the time
good,Lack of communication and empty promises. Management won't listen to complaints or concerns and definitely won't do anything about it. Constantly make promises to help improve work life but nothing ever changes
good,"I hated this place, I discovered roaches and rats on food all the time, I will never work at this place again. I couldn't dream of a worse place to work."
good,"Working for this company has been just that WORK. Managers don't listen to your opinions, and only give praise to hand only a few of the workers. Turn over rate is crazy!"
good,"Came to dinner with a group and me and my guest were not granted my half off discount as advertised in my interview. Manger tell employees they should make $20 per hour, don't get your hopes up. At the Odessa, FL location servers on the restaurant leave there with approx $100 per shift, which equals out to about $12 per hour. Management is awufl, no respect for personal life (ex  - scheduling of mandatory meeting 8 am super bowl Sunday with no make up for employees who had to close the night before or the day of the meeting). I stuck it out in this corporate situation, but after being denied my employee discount, I don't have a reason to stay now! It's like high school all over again, and the management just feeds right into it."
good,"Decent job. Very stressful environment, Little help from management. Benefits are dismal, and no job security. The fact of the matter is that it becomes what you make of it."
good,"Loved my co-workers, really struggled with inconsistent hours, I was sent home when it was slow, and had no help when it was crazy busy. The waitstaff expected the hostess to bus all their tables when they had a lot of tables. It was very stressful."
good,"Poor management while not paid fairly. When put two weeks notice in, was asked to leave with no benefits and was not allowed to work even the two weeks. Managers are just looking to take advantage of employees and have no interest in them."
good,"The average day was pretty hectic. It seemed like once you got sat you got sat every 5 minutes. The goal of Chili's is a ""burn and turn"" establishment which meant fast paced and quickly get your customers to cash out so you can get more people in the door. It was a bit competitive, some peers might take some money here or there or take good paying customers out from under your nose. The hardest part of the job is when your section gets sat with big, church parties (like, 20 people, give or take) and your section partner wont help, since you're not technically obligated to split the tip. The most enjoyable part was I had never been part of a more close knit, family like establishment. They had numerous get together and it's not uncommon for everyone to still get together and hangout. It's like a constantly growing family."
good,"Not where you want to stay, unless you fall under management. For a first job, I'd recommend it, but it won't keep food on the table as the pay rate is low."
good,A typical day included doing many other jobs including your own. Many times it would be just me doing everything while other s just stood around. There was little team work and I would get little positive feedback and reinforcement from my managers form my hard work. I would be visibly very busy and still told to go do something else. Overall a very stressful work environment.
good,"I did not like the upper management, the general manager never came to work, and when they were there it was always complete chaos. The hours worked in a week was way to much, was told i would work 50-55 hours a week, but averaged more then 60+ per week."
good,"We live in this society where restuarants think its acceptable to pay their servers less than $3 an hour to represent the restuarant, food, and customer service, expecting that they should get compensated by their guests. This whole mantality is disturbed. Restuarants should be paying their servers a living wage and if they so happen to get tipped so be it."
good,De mi parte el area es buena pero ay muchas cosas con respecto a los supervisores que no ponen atencion ni el momento para la importancia del area y equipo de trabajo
good,Hated working here. Everyone was so involved with each other and it was not a professional workplace. Everything was unorganized and people were not praised for good work and often went unnoticed.
good,Chilis'  is a fun and upbeat place to work. Lasting friendships and teamwork are what I took away from this company. It was rewarding working with the public.
good,"Work day as management can range from 10 to 14 hrs. Corporate micro manages every tiny system. Every Restaurant is expected to be ran exactly the same way with no thought put into the location, demographic, or guest base. Unrealistic sales goals, with the design of no expectation to hit the numbers to earn bonus. Over worked, underpaid, understaffed."
good,"this is just a regular waitressing job that pretty much sums it up."
good,Very fast paced. Customers dont understand that we get busy. Lousy tips
good,Highschoolers might love trhis job because they work with your schedule. Plus they get payed every week.
good,"When I started at Chili's, business was great, the people were easy to get along with, and the management staff wanted to work with the serving and bartending staff. The typical day shifted when a new staff of managers came in. The typical day shifted from working reasonable hours of one had other priorities such as children or school, to unpredictable hours and expecting employees to stay and cover shifts they were not responsible for. The job also involved greeting people and seating them at appropriate tables, taking food and drink orders, rolling silverware, stocking and cleaning, and taking to-go orders over the phone. I learned how to listen to people and to make them feel welcome in a coporate atmosphere. The management staff cared more about their own jobs than helping out the serving staff and making the guests happy. The coworkers were great. They made each day a good day to work. The coworkers were the gold standard of what team work should be in resturants. The hardest part of the job was understanding guest complaints when the guest was not at my table to begin with. The most enjoyable part of the job was the comradarie of the people I worked with."
good,"the management at this store was trivial at best. they say its a dog eat dog world, this store epitomises that saying"
good,"It’s okay for a part time job, working at Chile’s full time is stressful because we are understaffed I like my coworkers and as a cook you get free meals"
good,Work you hard no benefits unless your management. No chance in advancement pay increase is a null. Expected to do other people's work as well as your own
good,"Work place is okay and mostly clean!Staff are two-faced, managers are two-faced and talk behind employees back non-stop. Management definitely needs to be fired and improved! I can say the cooks are clean and food is never an issue! The cups are very dirty and the dish washer, puts all dishes through once ! Wether they are clean or not. Pay is okay, but they ask you to go up and beyond with no additional pay, compensation or even a honest down to heart thank you. If you need the money, go for it but, i can say its not worth the disrespect!"
good,"The managers don't care about what their employees request. They do not hold people accountable for slacking off, and we don't get any benefits for picking up slack. The schedule was never what I needed it to be, I asked for less hours because I needed to focus on school this semester and when the next schedule came out I was scheduled 30 plus hours."
good,"Somebody is always calling out. Leaving others to pick up slack, so no , ""forward direction"" occurs.. simply stuck in a rut. Expectations are too high for a single individual. Standards are unevenly distributed,( according to business). No faith in the companys' progression. due to always being between a rock and a hard place. Management holds nobody (except those who take it upon themselves) accountable for anything. including, but not limited to: tardiness, failed attendance, work ethic, or basic knowledge and performance."
good,"Managers do not care to care about your life. If you need days off you probably won't get them. People talk to you crazy( costumers, management, and staff)."
good,"I am thankful for having the experience of waiting tables, however, management plays a huge role in the success of any company. The assistant manager that was brought in caused a ton of issues for not just the employees but for the guest also."
good,Managers change too frequently. They promise advancement opportunities and then hire from the outside. They don't have any consistency. Their communication is terrible and they don't support the employees in a customer-employee conflict.
good,chili's wasn't the best place to work although it is a good discount and nice coworkers. management sucks. they were good people but didnt pay attention to employees needs. you are over worked.
good,A typical day at work would be running pretty slow and smoothly. The management needs to improve. They don't know how to schedule people very well and they always have bad attitudes toward the employees. Work used to be fun back when I first started and now it feels like I'm in a jail. I enjoy working with my fellow peers. They make work better! The culture is pretty unique. We still have along ways to go and improve.
good,"No room for advancements unless you have worked there for way too long. I worked as a server so the pay is pretty much nonexistent from the actual company, but that is known going in. I got lucky and worked with some awesome coworkers, however."
good,"Quickly looked down upon from the rest of the other employees. I would try and keep up,even though most nights need 2. A good handful of the employees were arrogant."
good,"Very low hourly pay, no benefits, never a set schedule, shifts were all over the place, almost never worked a full assigned shift (would be cut halfway through, thus taking away from declared tips and hourly wage), management was poor."
good,"my co workers always look up to me for answers and help,and i am glad to help them.I work with real good people who want to do a above average job."
good,"Tightly managed and maintained food and beverage company that teaches incoming managers the business from the ground up. On a daily basis most managers are asked to wear many hats and juggle many duties while also maintaining excellent customer service. Tight cost controls help maintain even tighter budgets, but constant vigilance is necessary."
good,"A typical day at Chili's was busy, slow, or stressful. Working at a restaurant is unpredictable. I learned how to do multiple positions and multitask."
good,"evening shift and den next day morning shift."
good,i was a cook and cashier here for about more than a year and i would always be cleaning up after everyone. not a very great place to work
good,When I first got the job it was great! The managers were awesome and the people seemed pretty nice. After a while i realized the pay didn't balance the hours I made. The servers gossiped a lot about the host and the shift manager sexual harassed the girls! I filed a sexual harassment report against the manager and the other girls did everything they could to get me fired. Not recommended!
good,"Despite the terrible management, employees were very motivated and hard workers. There was little time to catch your breath, however, because business was constant and never-ending. I learned how to stay on my toes and handle multiple jobs at once while performing to the best of my ability. Overall, it was a great experience learning how to multitask while handling customer needs."
good,I worked for this company for a total of  eight years and it can be a great place to work sometimes the guest can be very difficult to deal with the thing I like the most is the training opportunities
good,Chili’s is like a train that never stops. The managers seem like they’re half trained; and corporate can’t seem to grasp the concept that some stores sell different things based of the demographic. Thus meaning the line would have to be set and stocked for different things
good,"In the southern region servers are not being taken care of. They get paid 2.13 and make 15 to 18%."
good,Fast past sometimes bad management and not enough pay is what you get at this company. Can work 40+ hrs for weeks then they cut you down to 30+ cause your making to much money. The boh is funny and the front of house isn’t that bad. Have to do managers job managing the foh and boh and deal with the km and the  gm. Not what you show led get payed cuase they don’t want to pay what you’re worth to even after you have experience. You will not get above 15$ as a boh
good,"The manager who makes the schedule gives the best days to people she likes, and gives barely to people she doesn’t like for personal reasons that shouldn’t be involved in a work place."
good,"Lots of running around, doing many jobs "
good,I was a good place to work for the time. I couldn't make a career out of the food industry so i decided to make a switch. That is when I left to go work for Vestas Aerotek
good,I don’t like this job at all. I would not recommend anyone else to go work here. The management team is very unprofessional. They have really bad reviews.
good,"The work is fun and challenging but there is a lot of drama and the Managers really don't care about their employees, especially the head manager. They tend to treat you like you are very replaceable, even when you work hard."
good,"Well Chilis really needs work. There’s no gruduity on the slips which doesnt help the servers get any type of money most of the time working at Chilis will consist of customers walking out on their bill, not tipping, cursing at servers and we have to take that I do understand that’s our job but not to the point we can not pay our bills. We do not get paid on promises. We as a server at Chilis make 2.83 mostly everyday getting off of work I make about 80 dollars or less which I use 10 dollars a day to get home. Its a hassle period to stress on meeting ends meet but can not even eat smh"
good,Working for chilis was a temporary job that gave me the ability to put cash in my pocket. I was looking for something more permanent when I started and began building my resume for the future.
good,can be slow or fast paced depends on the day. Mgt was good about helping out when needed. Servers sometimes help out if you need it or are falling behind.
good,"They peach to you ""quality of life"" but don't actually care about your needs. I had to constantly fight for what I wanted, for time off with my family, or to be able to leave at a reasonable time."
good,The job from back of the house to front was a joke and so was the pay. There are many good memories I have with guest and coworkers but the lack of good management and pay had me leave.
good,I cried everyday after work only two really great managers and both weren't hands on the hands on manager was a jerk he wasn't flexible didn't care about your life or advancement.
good,My only problem at chili`s was the pay rate. It felt like I was doing to much work for not enough money. I did all my duties I was assigned to do but there was still no good outcome for me.
good,Management could of been better. I would not like to work there anymore. That's about it I can really tell you but I would recommend someone else to work there.
good,Management loved to hide whenever there was a problem. Constant change over of managers all unqualified to handle the restaurant. Staff was way over worked.
good,"Not appreciated, managers not focused on most important thing guests.  I enjoyed making schedules.  Some of the people I worked with were okay.  Managers not organized, never on same page."
good,"I acquried many skills being a waitress, time management, multi tasking, customer service, and great accountability. "
good,I worked at chili's for so long because I loved who I worked with but management was a little downhill. Our general manager who often did nothing but give orders made everyone nervous. We had another supervisor who was really scatterbrained and got overwhelmed easily. Another supervisor who often got in trouble so was constantly overwhelmed when all she tried to do was keep the restaurant running smoothly.
good,"While the culture of the job is fun and interesting, I have never seen a restaurant crew as stressed out as at Chili's. The management constantly changed and with it, the rules and regulations, the environment was oppressive, and servers were constantly stiffed as management far too frequently gave free meals to customers."
good,"It was a very good job very fun job Nice employees"
good,Its a cool place to work. They just have a hard time keeping good management. Iv seen at least 20 managers come and go. Some of them were really good and should not have had to leave the company its just sad.
good,"Typical day at work, is greeting guests, and seating them. Sometimes the guest can be rude, but its whatever. The worst part about working here was my co workers and one manager were so disrespectful. Just didn't talk to me with respect at all, would make fun of me, and I am not going to continue to work in that environment."
good,"el ambiente es agradable con gente que conoce bien su labor y la sabe hacer de la mejor forma, le hace falta un poco de compañerismo."
good,"Chilli's is a difficult restaurant to work at, even if you have server experience, which I did not. That being said, then I decided that being server while going to school full time was not the best fit for me at that particular corporation."
good,"Service with a Sizzle!  A typical day for me was starting my shift with completing the tasks assigned to the section I was working that day prior to starting my Lunch or Dinner Shift.  During the shift I interacted with customers by taking their food and drink orders with a smile.  I learned a lot about customer service and how to make my service more efficient.  My management team was young and inexperienced at the time when I worked there.  My co-workers were there to make money, as was I.  We were friendly with each other and had great team work, which is needed in the food service industry.  We learned rather quickly that if we worked together we made more money and provided better customer service.  Teamwork is extremely important in any working environment that is customer driven.  Chili's worked very well with my schedule while I attended college.  The hardest part of my job was working fourteen hour shifts on some days.  The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting the people that came to the restaurant."
good,"Chili's was a really fun place to work. The entire staff was full of young college kids like myself. A typical day of work involved a lot of cleaning of the eating area before opening and after closing. I have a very friendly personality so I enjoyed talking with customers and was able to develop regular customers who requested me as their server when they came to the restaurant. The management at the time was very childish and things tended to be unorganized. At the time I even dealt with inappropriate comments that were directed toward me from management. They have new management now and from what I have heard, they are MUCH better!"
good,"decent place to work for, dead end job. too much stress and work for the money"
good,over all good but some management problems with poor conflict resolution
good,"A typical day at work consisted of beverage, food, and customer service. I learned to work as a team instead of a manager. The hardest part about the job was waiting on customers who had a bad day and were rude, and the best part was when I won the Margarita Madness Competition for selling the most premium top shelf Margaritas and all the support from staff and co-workers. The co-workers were awesome and it was so was the food. This was a fun and enriching experience."
good,"horrible turn over rate, bad scheduling, there is an opportunity to make excellent money, hard to advance"
good,"He believes in anyone. Although he has some managers that need more training . One of them needs to learn to communicate with people. Another manager fratnizes with the employees. Other than those things, which caused issues in the workplace it would be great."
good,The work is easy. The management can be a little greedy with labor. Currently manager won’t hire anybody bc “we don’t need anybody” but we’ve been short staffed almost two months. When it’s not short staffed it’s pretty easy.
good,When there was a good management team it ran incredibly well but as soon as corporate pushed the good managers away it went right back down the tubes.
good,"My review of the Company is Management definitely needs improvement and skills on communicating with staff."
good,I went from working full time and even overtime to 11 hours a week then to two hours a week due to keeping labor cost down. I’ve had to get several jobs to be able to live.
good,a fun loving place for the workers and a good platform to learn the knowledge . I learned the main difference between service and hospitality.  a good management for the marketing strategy but poor management for the employee benefits and the norms.
good,I enjoyed working for Chili's but unfortunately managers are required to put in too much extra time without compensation.  I worked over 60+ hours a week only being compensated for 50 hour work week.
good,"I will leave this very professional, even though it might have not worked out for me, it could be your perfect home! Only complaints was the unprofessionalism and management."
good,"I worked at chili’s for about a year and at first it was a great place, getting used to the fast pace was just the easy part... the managers were very fair at first then I saw their true colors. That consisted of talking very rudely behind the backs of team members and lying. The amount of times I got told I wasn’t a good employee was crazy when I was doing my job, Not to mention the late hours as a student. Besides that I had amazing team members and made great friends and good money, but you’re definitely working for it..."
good,Pay is Pretty good and you can sometimes get good overtime. Managers are hit or miss and some don’t really care about employees. Experienced managers talking about employees in a negative way. Requesting time off is a hassle because they won’t tell you if you get it. You’ll have to wait for the schedule to come a day or two before the next pay period. Usually the workers who have been there the longest get the best shifts. Good place to work if you have good managers and a good team. No guaranteed breaks on double shifts which can be from 12-16 hours. Let them know if you’re going to get sick the day before. Calling in can usually get you in trouble no matter what for. Work hard and you can advance easily. Good team members can make a shift enjoyable but it is a very stressful and fast paced job.
good,Good starting job for someone who wants to get into waiting tables. You have to work very very hard all the time. I commonly sweat at work. tips could range from $20-150 a shift.
good,"Poor management, lack of quality control, poor budgeting, no real career advancement, staff horribly under trained. Store has failed inspection. Poor cleaning habits"
good,"This position is perfect if you are just starting off and want work experience because of the skills you have to acquire in order to be successful in that company, however the pay is very poor and is not realistic."
good,"Coworkers acted as if they were still in High School. Very clique-y, judge-y, petty, and there was too much gossip, not enough work ethic. It wasn't a job I wanted to work. I want to find a job I enjoy going to, a place where I can feel safe and in a sense needed."
good,"Chilis is a great way to make a lot of money if you are great at serving. but the problem is that the managers act like children. if you arent scheduled and they ask you to come in and you cant, they will treat you poorly and sometimes just completely ignore you! they gossip to other employees and they will pick and chose favorites. for example i forgot to bring a belt one day so they sent me home and someone else they liked wasnt wearing a belt and they said they just get a warning and they were able to stay. so if you arent on the managers good side you might as well just quit."
good,"Working at Chili's is not difficult, it can become stressful and fast paced when busy, but what is required of you job-wise is not difficult. However, there is an increasing trend of management ""manufacturing"" the hours. What I mean by this is that they will move numbers around to give everyone just few enough hours/ pay to benefit the establishment, but not to pay their employees a sufficient amount to survive."
good,Sets unrealistic sales plans knowing target bonuses will not be achieved and bonus plans with help the companies bottom line profit when reporting to wall street at EOY.
good,"Nice place to work but not very busy, hours are short, nice managers. Not a lot of room for advancement. Clean restaurant, flexible hours. Younger wait staff."
good,"No opportunity for advancement. Management promised promotions that never happened. The people on the bottom work the hardest physically taxing, and no tip outs."
good,"Awesome training program, extremely stressful, no room for error, at times poor management. Money is fast but not all money is good money. Expectation is the enemy."
good,I don't mind working in a restaurant but I wouldn't recommend working at a chain. You take a lot of abuse from customers and the pay is so low that you often fight over tables with other servers.
good,Very stressful no work/life balance. No advancement. One of the manages there was very unfair. I would not go back to work there as it was a very stressful job never had time for anything else.
good,"Ok job, the Money is good but for the whole time I was there we were short staffed. An ok environment if you do not have a family. Loved the community of staff we did have."
good,"Brinkerpays to little, hard to keep a good quality of life, big company, good benefits, good food, long shifts, low wages, disconnect from corporate to stores."
good,"Despite the restaurant being a very lucrative business, it also does have fun moments. When I first started with this company, everything was fun and we did a lot of team based activities. However in the recent years, despite how great of a server you are, your job ultimately depends on a survey done by the guest. Results from these surveys vary from day to day and whether an incident is your fault or the fault of the kitchen, your job can be snatched because of it."
good,"Once I transferred to Greensboro chili’s the atmosphere was horrible, management was poor and lacked accountability. Extremely stressful & toxic environment, for guests & employees alike. Management team not on the same page."
good,"I do not want to write a review. However I would recommend working at a Chilis restaurant just not the one in West Lebanon NH. Very Poor and inconsistent management, did make some good friends there particularly the bartenders and a few of the servers. Good money and no tip sharing which is a plus"
good,"you work so much that you see the people you work with waaaay more than anyone else so you grow close to your coworkers, hope ya like em lol you will also run your buns off"
good,Great for making quick money during serving shifts. Specific policies must be upheld to maintain employment. Contests and specific selling goals are expected by the company and it is frowned upon if these are not upheld.
good,It was a great place to work when it comes to the work itself. There were favorites among the servers to each manager and you could clearly see that. People were treated differently and got to get away with certain things that would have gotten other people terminated or at least repremanded.
good,hosts have very little time to function and if you do well you get yelled at more. they make up new jobs for you every other day and it never gets enough done to actually get tipped out. coworkers are rude and management was poor. I got no breaks and even got yelled at when i had to drink after having to work when i had a bilateral kidney infection and had notified manangement.
good,"been with chilis for about 4 years. Their managers are lacking experience, and tend to undermine the other staff. Constant power trips and irresponsibility"
good,"i like serving, but not where i’m at. there’s no respect between management and employees and many employees have left because of it. money is an issue as well"
good,management needs help. workplace has a lot of favoritism going on. if you are on the good side of the manager then your okay even if you do something wrong. I did everything I can when I was working there and they never gave me a server title
good,The management was very rude and didn't know how to talk to people. Very disrespectful to women. Everyone in the one I worked at was dating the other person. Everyone took thing out on each other. The only good position there would be a server. Being a host was the worst. Everyone who worked there was miserable.
good,The fact that you could make actual cash every night was nice but I didn't like trying to force someone to buy something. You either want it or you don't.
good,Everyday I made sure to try to help hit our quota and stay positive at all times.  I learned how to work well and communicate with other employees as a team.
good,"Working as a server gave me the opportunity to challenge my ability of speed and pace to accomplish an overall successful service to customers. With the best of my ability, I learned how to work and earn for my tips by providing outstanding customer service, working quickly to serve food/drinks and maintaining my surrounding environment clean, safe and organized. Most enjoying part of my job was serving friendly customers and having staff support you when the restaurant atmosphere gets busy."
good,"The management was sucky. I had to basically beg to be a server when others got it willingly. I was able to do so, better than others and yet they still deprived me of it and was treated like dirt."
good,Stressful and never consistent. Never got the pay or advancement that was deserved. Promote women first because their women. I would never work there again
good,"Come in, grab an apron and rags and proceed to check your reach-ins on the line. Restock as much as you can in between orders. Go through two large rushes then start cleaning about an hour before close. Close your station and clean the kitchen. I learned that our kitchen needed a leader put in charge. a designated kitchen manager and ""head"" cook would have solved almost all of the problems. but our payroll wouldn't get expanded by corporate. Management was mediocre at best. The people I worked with were generally enjoyable people to be around. Mostly humble people, not too many egos. Culturally it was pretty diverse and most of the staff had a good sense of humor. The hardest part of working the on that line is the volume of food. our window (pass) would be so full of food for over five minutes we would literally have to stop cooking so quality assurance could catch up. very frustrating. The most enjoyable part of the job was the fast-paced nature on the line and having fun with the other cooks. the kitchen was way closer than the front of house"
good,Started in an established store. Moved and opened a new store. Lots of learning and growth opportunity. Laid a good foundation for getting into management.
good,To those who have worked in the food service industry and understand the stress and fast pace work that of course comes with the job... Chili's isn't too bad.
good,"The job is your life, no time for family. Constantly having to get rid of staff due to labor constrants even though you still need them. Corporate work is alway how to make the stockholders money, not how to take care of the people who actually make the money for them."
good,"For the short time i was employed, it was a complete disaster. I lie to you not, following from unprofessional management, to running out of things on a daily basis, down to working 13 hours with no break and then to be lectured upon for being in a slightly bad mood. I would not recommend for anyone to work for this company."
good,"I got hired on as a line cook and they said that I apparently needed to start from the bottom by doing dishes as a dishwasher then I'd work my way up but I talked to a line cook who had transferred in and he said he NEVER started off as a dishwasher and hasn't known anyone else to do so. So, I got lied to about that apparently, on top of the fact I worked TWO jobs and they wanted me to SOLEY work for them and let me go because I didn't want to burn a bridge at my previous job and ask the NIGHT BEFORE if I could come in at the end of my shift at my other job. Yes chili'spaid me $2.50 more than my other job, but it's the principal of things and I was raised to not burn bridges at ANY job. AnywAys this bridge is def burned and I'm never going to work for chilis again 👌🏻"
good,do opening duties for lunch which weren't to bad or to much. I also learned to seat guests bartend and do dishes if needed. Most of the time management was good except for 1 who they made GM she was terrible! Very uncaring to customer complaints and employees. Having to do all duties because they would send people home then we'd get real busy. Meeting and speaking with customers.
good,when i was working there i was working with a hiring program at the beginning it seemed as they really needed me then they moved me to prep and then to fry while still in the program and said would hire me after the program was over and then once the program ended they didn't. The managers told me what i did wrong with one week left of the program i would not recommend applying here for any position. other coworkers hours were being cut just to hire more people.
good,I only worked for Chili's temporarily. The training was very robotic and repetitive. Co-workers need some customer service training. Management was very dictating and made you feel very closed off. I enjoyed working with the customers rather than the actual employees. Chili's needs to revamp or it ratings will get the best of them.
good,"Too many managers to listen to, each one tells you a different task to do and they do not communicate with each other so you end up always in trouble because you cannot get everyone's tasks done."
good,"A typical work day at Chili's is usually a fast paced environment where you are given several tasks to complete during the hospitality and dining experience. An employee has to engage in team work and must maintain very stellar interpersonal communication skills with their guests. Our goal at Chili's is to create a unique dining experience for our guests. I have learned to keep calm under pressure and to maintain a positive attitude regardless of whatever challenging situations have been placed in front of me. "
good,"I loved most of my coworkers. I adored my regulars. The hardest part of the job was management. They talked down to us servers. We were treated like animals. There were racial slurs from the managers and harassment. The most enjoyable part of my job was getting to serve guest, out on the floor i was always positive with a smile. I would leave all the negative in the back of my mind. I learned patience and how to roll with the punches."
good,"Every young worker should work at a restaurant at some point in their lives. I did it early and I have not intentions on going back to that field. Its not a bad place, its the customers that make it crazy"
good,"I need a job where i can advance as fast as I learn. It hasn't happened due to my young age, its derailed the positions i get. I love to cook and had a higher food standard then the managers, we had a falling out. Then I quit, and the managers got job transfers due to the situation. i was used for personal gain of coworkers and learned what a dead end job was."
good,Good place for first time jobs. You handle customers one on one. Food and money handle required. Flexible hours available which are good for people with more than one job or college students.
good,"I love working for Chili's, I love the people I work with and I like that I get half off of food. My job as a host includes engaging guests in conversation, welcoming them to Chili's, cleaning the host and front door areas, folding kids menus, rolling kids silverware, sometimes running food to tables, busing tables, sweeping the restaurant, restocking supplies in the bathrooms when needed. The hardest part of my job is trying to engage every single guest in conversation, sometimes it's hard to have a conversation when you have your back to someone. However I've learned to ask them how they are, or ask them something like ""What have you folks been up to today?"" just something simple like that before I begin showing them to their table. "
good,"Managers are stressful waitresses are rude."
good,"This seemed like an optimal place to work. About 2 months in I started noticing the way the restaurant ran was not the best way, and their ethics conflicted with mine. I left Chili's due to the management having favoritism and discriminating against me because I was new. Overall, not the best place to work."
good,"As quality assurance I would make sure the food that the servers needed for the guest would go out on time and made the way the guest wanted it. I learned that working in the restaurant business at times can be stressful. The management there was not great, a lot of the co-workers were great hardworking people that I enjoyed being around. The hardest part of this job was that I was not appreciated for my hard work, and the enjoyable part was that I made life long friends   from that job."
good,"Typical day at work involved checking in with manager and station buddy. Making sure station was stocked and ready. Taking orders and making sure every guest had an enjoyable meal and left with a smile, as well as, taking payments and providing change. Working as a team to help kitchen run smoothly and making sure every station was stocked in order to function smoothly was very important. Then we would clean our work station at end of shift before checking out with manager, which required us to turn in the money we had collected from payments during our shift. I had previous experience in customer service in the restaurant industry but Chili's was much busier and had bigger work stations with more tables than any other restaurants I had worked at before, so I learned how to really manage a large table section with ease. My co-workers were amazing workers and so helpful, always there when I needed help or looked like I was struggling without even needing to be asked. The hardest part of the job, unfortunately, wasn't even anything pertaining to the job. There were too many personal issues floating about the restaurant that everyone would get tied up in, managers included. They would sometimes consume our time so much that it would cause a server to fall behind. The most enjoyable part of the job was the laughs and the energy and environment of the restaurant on good days. "
good,"The managers at Chilis make it very clear that you are completely disposable to them. One mistake, and anything good you have done no longer matters or is taken into consideration. A typical day at work is a typical 5 hour shift, making good tips, thinking you have done great, and then being confronted at the end of your shift about what every single thing you did wrong and making you feel as if you are in trouble, regardless of the fact that you made customers happy, got food out on time, were constantly helping in the kitchen, etc. The most enjoyable part of the job was fellow coworkers sharing in your pain."
good,"Working at Chilis is a headache, they work you until they cant work you any more. Working at Chilis gives me no freedom."
good,Fun place to work if your going to school. They work around your schedule. management not very good.
good,Management is not understanding and is very discouraging towards employees. It's hard to find coverage if you need a shift off. Don't ever try and take a vacation while you are employed here.
good,I would not recommend this company.  Overall they do not care about their employees.  I was promoted and basically let go for doing something management told me to do. It was a set up.
good,Great place to work if work pressure will be reduced you will not have a job security can't balance your personal life Salaries can be revised with more benefits
good,"The portage store I worked at was fine pretty much a Standard restaurant, although the management was fantastic and they were fun to work with, i would recommend working there to anyone who is looking for that kind of work"
good,"Not a bad job, I worked there off and on for about 5 years. It wasn't that bad, just didnt make enough money and never once got a raise or considered for a promotion. I left there and instantly got a management job."
good,"When I was hired I was told I would be good for the other servers seeing as I was about 10 years older than all the other servers and had a pretty significant serving background."
good,There were always too many servers during the day so you wouldn’t make as much money because you wouldn’t get any tables. If the kitchen made an error the servers were blamed and came out of your tips
good,"I would say there was anything special about working for chili’s. I came to work to serve and make tips, and I did just that. They were not anything to ride home about but good enough for the time"
good,El ambiente laboral es tranquilo aunque igual considero que se cometen muchas injusticias
good,The general manager passed the blame for everything wrong on to others and took no responsibility for himself. He is a bus driver and tosses everyone under him under the bus to keep his job. He even strait up told me this to my face.
good,"A day here is very quick paced and you're definitely on your feet a lot. I've learned that things can only go as far as you let them. Management could be better. The hardest part is that there isn't that many hosts, so basically, you'd be on your own. The enjoyable part would be the food."
good,"I've worked as a waitress and bartender for almost 6 years, and when I made the choice to move it felt natural to pick up a part time at a local restaurant. Having only worked at family- or locally-owned places in the past, jumping into a corporate environment was a bit of a culture shock."
good,Most of the time in this line of work not everything is going to be peachy but honestly the money was defiantly not worth everything that went on in that place. 10/10 do not recommend.
good,"Tough environment to work in.  One manager can ruin the entire bunch.  Senior employees did not welcome new employees, they did not want new employees taking their shifts."
good,Very stressful environment. Management not well trained at all anyone can become a manager.  They hire anyone felons and drug addicts that's part of the reason i left.  Just to much stress and drama.
good,"Nothing really stands out about this place, there is worse jobs, there is better jobs. 5/10 would not go back to work there again but the tips were good"
good,"A typical day spent here includes taking multiple tables at once, taking their orders, explaining the menu, bringing their food and drinks out in a timely manner."
good,"Chili's was a good work place for me, I worked there for 4+yrs. I learned a lot of customer service skills and so much more.it was a great opportunity to meet a lot of new people!"
good,I had a great time working at chilli's for the most part. Until my general manager was fired and replaced did the environment tend to sink. Alot of people quit due to the lack of respect and being forced hours that didn't fit the availability of my fellow crew members.
good,"Ho lavorato per diversi anni nell'azienda e mi sono trovato quasi sempre bene, alcune cose sono però da migliorare"
good,"team members run the show. If trying to be a manager for chili's, remember the team members are always right. "
good,"Working at Chili's I did multiple jobs from Serving customers, To-Go, Hostessing, and Rolling silverware. Management was impossible just hard to work around. I would work with Chili's again though."
good,"Okay work place, the employees make this job comfortable but there is poor management at the West End location. When I worked her I felt as if I put more in that what I was getting out."
good,Over all  it could be better I don't like how they run things the management don't take stuff in consideration when things are going bad they would say are we going to look into it and they never would who treat their customers and employees  so bad something things can be a little bit better over there they don't take life serious they take your life for granted over there
good,"At first I loved Chili’s because everyone is nice and I was told I would make more than I actually made once I started the job. I also assumed that I would know what time my shift ends. Everyday into work, we never know when we’re going to leave. Its very hard to balance work and school without knowing when you’re going to be cut from work. It is very inconvenient and no one told me about that before I started this job! On the bright side, managers are understanding and communicate very well with their team members, however, I wouldn’t recommend anyone to work for Chili’s if you’re a college student like me. The money is too unpredictable and you’re literally never going to know when you can leave."
good,"My managers were horrible, so I'm sure the experience would be much better elsewhere. The atmosphere is always fun, and servers stand to make a lot in tips. Its a sports bar branded as a family restaurant."
good,This is not a place to have a permanent job. If you are going to school or looking for a stepping stone in life then this is a great place to quickly enter and leave.
good,"Typical day = Stressful, cut throat, repetitive "
good,This is not intended to be a full time job.  It is very physically demanding and the turnover rate is awful.  I think the location had a lot to do with why I couldn't make the money I needed to make.
good,Towards the end of my time at chili’s I was so unsatisfied with the manger staff .Ive worked st this location for 5 years and I’ve had 4 general managers and out of all the ones I’ve had I’ve never felt like I was less appreciate before.
good,"It was a stressful place to work with crazy expectations and little to no chance of job advancement, but they do work with school schedules if you are a student and the tips are decent. Management is crazy and fickle."
good,"In 2010, Chili's made the decision to ""revamp"" what they do. The life and culture completely changed and it seemed they were trying to flush out the high paid employess to bring in less skilled employees. Hours and job descriptions changed, making it impossible for a single mother to get 40 hours a week."
good,"fast paced, multitasking at its finest, great people, and pretty good money most of the time. I enjoyed my 4 years there. just needed a change for me and my daughter."
good,"It is a relaxed workplace culture and a good job for quick cash. While the management is not always professional I was able to make more money in college then my friends were making. It was not a bad experience, but not a great one either."
good,"A typical day would start by trying to find a manager to clock you in because you probably already have customers in your section that might have been waiting there for who knows how long. So this is where making the customer happy comes in and when I have to work a little harder because they have already been waiting there for sometime. Management only comes to table if there is a problem with the food and thats after the second or third time the food had to be fixed. if your lucky youll get a five dollar of coupon or a free dessertn for your next visit for an apology"
good,If you need some extra cash or a college student it’s perfect. Flexable hours but you should work some busy shifts to make better money than on a lunch shift.
good,"Chili's is an ""OK"" place to work.  The employees are cool and you can make many friends.  The management on the other hand tends to pick favorites and those favorites can do no wrong."
good,I would go in and stand at the door and wait for people to come in a and seat them then for togo I would wait for the phone to ring to take someone's order and for qa I would prepare the food coming out everything was fast pace and the managers it would depend on who was working some were better than others.
good,"It was a great job to learn how to host and the restaurant business. However, management gives people who are new higher positions instead of those who have seniority."
good,"I worked at chilis in multiple positions, and was offered a 'key' or managment position at a time. they are inconsistent, and lack structure. though the job itself, was fun..it was hard to take it seriously when bosses didn't."
good,A usual day was often strenuous & not very clean. I learned some hard work ethics by working there as my first job. The management at the time was not very friendly. The workplace culture was fun to be around because mostly everyone had positive motives & were very friendly. The hardest part of the job was being sopping wet after each shift. The most enjoyable part of the job was the food to help get me through the night.
good,"The food is good and so are most of the people. the 2 problems with chilis is the ticket times and the type of managers they hire. nobody wants to wait 30+ minutes for food, and no employee wants to hunt down his boss daily for his managers card."
good,"this company is very unorganized and out of place due to lack or workers and not enough workers . I feel server at chili's are underpaid and should have a free meal and proper break times . the hardest part of the job is not having your team member work as a team , and the good thing about working there is you meet new people everyday"
good,"Culture diminishing, hours extending, poor upper management, miscommunication throughout brand, ever-changing expectations and lack of coaching and development"
good,hardly any benefits or healthcare. don't make any money.cooks are a joke management could care less too many people on no training system people don't last working here hosts and bussers do nothing but stand around
good,"loved getting 50% off food from multiple restaurants. can use discount card in other states, good for travel. hostess had to bus more tables than should have"
good,if your looking for fast cash short hours restaurant's are great. chili's is an ok place to work as long as you can deal with the public.High volume fast pace.
good,"I really like the company and most of my managers, but the staff is always immature and starts a lot of gossip and drama. If you couldn't cover someone elses shift they would always twist it around to make you seem like the bad guy."
good,"Lots of drama, but that's standard with any restaurant. Managers are decent except for the guy who runs the place. Serving there is weird. They give you 12 tables and a partner to rotate your section with. If you get weeded, you're done. It's not good in that aspect. Yes, there is money to be made, but it's not at that cost."
good,Typical work day was high stress. Manager were pretty nice but my coworkers weren't very kind. Hardest part of the job was the stress that came with it and the computer system.
good,The worst part of working for Chilis is the wait staff and the subsequent support of the wait staff.  the management only sort of know how to run a kitchen.  Most are brought up through the wait staff
good,Management was great at doing their duties and trying to maintain a professional and friendly atmosphere. However co workers\employees were very judgemental and dramatic. Everyone knew everyone's business in and out of work life. Training and working when busy was kept very profession and focused but also extremely fustrating and cranky.
good,"Review summary says it all. People are friendly, but the job as a whole is incredibly stressful. We should be paid more for the stress that derives from this job."
good,"It's great getting to know other staff and the regulars that come in all the time. It's tough applying all aspects of the job requirement due to lack of support on certain days. Corporate should realize that the employees at the restaurant level don't ""play restaurant,"" like they do. Instead do there best to be an actual restaurant with some of the most ridiculous job requirements."
good,Care not to go into detail due to other factors not needed to be posted.  Just know that no job is secure with this company. Really enjoyed working with others but turnover rate is extremely high from management to front of house.
good,"Fun to work there.... only because I like all sorts of people and making them smile...I enjoy being a server even tho it was alot of work.I was able to meet people from all over the world. The food was great and lots of spirits to offer. You can make money there because all the drinks, appetizers, variety of foods, and fantastic desserts!!!!!#!❤"
good,"Los servers que trabajan a tiempo completo y son entrenadores no brindan un buen trato a los servers part time. El pago de líneas que se cobra no me parece justo, cobran el 1% de la ganancia de la venta de ese día a la barra, 1 sol al host y 2 soles al qa."
good,Working for chili's was a great environment very nutrition environment the managers were very hands on and wanted all employees to grow in and with the company
good,"A lot of work for the money. May be a good start for a school aged employee, some managers were condescending, I wouldn't go back."
good,Chilis is based off of a family atmosphere. You all work together and help each other out when needed. I love the vibe when I go to work there because of the family atmosphere.
good,Very busy location. Not enough workers. Lack of order. Lack of Professionalism. Lack of rewards and acknowledgements.
good,Other than needing better managment work experience is great. Great expectations required by gm however pay is low. Co-workers are great to get along with and work experience was one of the best.
good,"A typical day may consist of coming to work, clocking in, acknowledging the other staff, checking my work station to see what needs to be stocked up and reviewing the orders on the screen to see what needs to be cooked.Once the shift is in motion, cook to order, clean work station, keep cook times within an efficient timeframe. Upon the end of a shift, or close of business, shift-change or closing procedures are being done. I learned alot about business operations. My management staff did not have great communication with the workers all the time, which sometimes led to longer order times or miscommunication in the kitchen. My coworkers were great. The hardest part of the job may have been adapting to some of the frequent changes in leadership and the expectations that came along with them."
good,Not the best or the worst company to work for. It all depends who you are working for as far as managers go. That's probably the same no matter where you work.
good,This job is great if a person is looking for a side job. They are willing to work with people on hours they try to make it flexible for people
good,I was not given enough hours. I worked over when they needed me. I worked afternoons to close. We did not have an evening manager.  I received and prepared customers' orders. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with my best friend. We get along great. The job wasn't hard at all. I caught on very quickly.
good,"My overall review on Chilis was that they were under staff, and the management wasnt always lined up exactly. They schedule people to many hours."
good,management didnt believe in any family events such as having a child or someone passing. always a problem to get time off even if you requested it months in advance
good,"Pros:"
good,Chilis will help you make some decent money but the management itself is horrible. They don't know how to run a restaurant.
good,I learned how to become a better team player with the coworkers. The hardest part of my job was when management could not stay on the same page. I would be told to do one thing that needed to change  and then they would not stick to what they told me to change. The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing guests come in and ask for me by name and we would sit and talk and enjoy our conversations.
good,"The management at the location I was at was absolutely horrid. The franchisee manager, had never actually worked in a restaurant, or a public service environment, so he had no idea how to conduct the place. He was a rigid and not a workable with person. The average day included seating guests, talking to them, often dealing with guest complaints yourself because the management team did not care. The hardest part about the job was working alongside people who have been in the industry and have experience on certain things while having to adhere to the lack of knowledge by the management team. Head office did close down the location because of numerous complaints, and the lack of meeting quota requirements."
good,No one knows how to work together. Its always a battle between morning and night shifts. Management always let the kitchen crash and burn and they have very little experience in running a kitchen
good,I greeted and seated customers. My co-workers were nice and helpful. Nothing hard about the job. The essential job duties were fairly easy and employees and management were all friendly.
good,"Typical day at work is prep during the weekdays and Line cook on the weekends"
good,"I enjoyed working here, but it was a very dirty. the staff did not care about the business and were all worried about making money"
good,"A typical day at work includes waiting on tables, cleaning, stocking, organizing, having to stick up for yourself to kitchen staff and management in order to keep your tables happy (only way of making money).  I learned a lot about working with a team, things about restaurant service I did not know, customer service, and finding confidence within myself in order to succeed in the job."
good,At Chili's you get to work with a diverse group of people which is the fun part. You have all different typed of personalities that makes chili's a fun place to be at. BUT being an under paid server to have all the responsibilities of making sure everything is clean is not what I cared for. It's very flexible with hours and overtime is not really overtime. Management is sometimes really good depending on your managers and the kind of people they are. There really isn't a hard part of the job besides keeping up with the fast pace that restaurants usually have.
good,"the managers walk around like there kings and queens no team work, bad cleanliness. no communication everyone has to fin for there self's. cooks get all the food out late on purpose just to get you mad."
good,"A typical day at Chili's was steady with a dinner ""rush"".  It was high volume and there was always something to do, which I enjoyed because I love to be on the move. Since it was the first restaurant I ever worked at I learned all the basics and fundamentals of the restaurant industry and front of house positions (host, server, to-go).  I was part of a core group of strong servers who stayed and thrived at Chili's, despite the restaurant having a high turnover rate of employees. The management changed drastically after I was there for 4 years.  Part of the new management team would turn and look the other way when HR should of been involved in many employee differences/circumstances that would normally not be tolerated in any work environment. After 6 years of employment, I was looking for a better opportunity where my hospitality skills would excel and work in a professional atmosphere."
good,"They are desperate to hire everyone and anyone, so all the people that work there think they are the best. It seems like everyone that works there is only concerned about themselves, there is no TEAM morale at all. Also, you don't make very good tips."
good,"I start by coming in on time, clock in, and hang my belongings up. Then I would go and make sure the tables are guest ready. When I'm hosting I made sure that I make the first impression. When I was serving I always introduced myself as soon as I could. made sure all the food came out together and came out fast. Management was great, they always where there when you needed them. I believe the hardest part of my job was when the guests complained about something and no matter what I do, it didn't help. I really enjoyed meeting new faces and socializing with all of them."
good,"A typical day at work will consist of unloading the food trucks, stocking the shelves and storing the food products in the dedicated areas.  I would gather the trash left over from the previous evening and throw it away.  Unload and load the dishwasher, clean my surrounding areas before I start to prep the food in order for the cooks to have their neccessary items to cook the meal ordered by the customers.  My management and co-workers are good to work with.  Everyone knows each other and can talk to one another and it feels like a family.  The hardest part of the job is not being able to take a dedicated lunch break when working around food all day.  The most enjoyable part of my job is having the ability to work with a team, but also have my own job duties that I'm personally responsible for."
good,Enjoyed working with customers. Enjoyed working on a one on one basis. The customers were mostly friendly and understanding.
good,"Over all Chilis was a pretty good place to work, I absolutely adored my co workers, and I truly learned a lot. The only downfall to the job was the management."
good,"Chili's on Cheltenham avenue is a okay place to work if your looking for a fast way to make money in the winter(that's the only time the money is consistent). However nothing is guaranteed there; the management is the worst, there's no sort of team work there, the environment is very ghetto, if your not a managers favorite don't expect to get any hours, its completely DEAD there in the summer, NEVER have any type of an emergency because they still want you to come to work with no remorse on what's going on with your personal life. This was a bad experience for me, however I did make money ."
good,"A typical day at Chili's doesn't really exist, every day was different. I learned a lot about talking to different people and how to relate to them in a short amount of time. I got along with my co-workers pretty well. The hardest part of the job, in my opinion, was to keep a smile on my face and agree with customers who were upset and  yelled at me. The most enjoyable part of the job were all the different kinds of people that would come in, because some of them were so enjoyable to talk with."
good,"Customer service, maintain a clean workstation, responsible for making drinks"
good,"No actual cooking experience needed to work here. "
good,Come in at five for the dinner rush with nothing prepped and having management blame you the second you put your apron on for everyone being behind.
good,"Too many employees, dont give enough hours. They also have this thing were as a waitress if you make so much in tips they will not pay you hourly. No employee discount on food."
good,"Coming in a s banquet server you set up and get drinks out, then work with your banquet captain to provide a great experience for the party."
good,"very fast paced and high volume managed hostess stand and accommodating guests needs, under hostess title but bussed tables for a majority of my shift with no tips."
good,"I enjoyed my time at the two Chilli's locations I worked, but there was not much room for advancement and breaks were not enforced properly by management."
good,"meet and greeted customers, and also seated them."
good,Fun place to work. I learned all about line cooking and working different stations. Learned prep work also.
good,The company is good to work for I just did not enjoy the management team there.
good,Its a great place to work if you need quick money that day. Your pay is based upon how hard you work. Mangers are very childish but if that doesnt bother you its a great place to work.
good,The hardest part of the job at the time was working until midnight or later every night then getting up for class the next morning. I enjoyed my co-workers as well as the management.
good,I loved working here for the simple fact that I enjoy taking care of the public. I had the ability to help them in selectiing menu items as well as upsell the products. The worst part of the job say saying bye at the end of my guests visits
good,"If you really need a job and have no where else to go, I suggest Chili's. I was not treated the way an employee should be treated, and never received any kind of benefits."
good,"The company as a whole is good. It is run well and the management team cares about the employees well being for the most part. Location is important and sadly, Millville is not a good place to try to make a living wage as a server. There is also no option for overtime."
good,Le asen falta más prestaciones para los miembros bde equipo y menos jornadas de trabajo
good,Company has the same bonus structure for the last 20 years even though min wage in MD has gone up every year. No bonus for MD restaurant while the VA stores get huge bonus with the lowest wages in the US . Not fair to MD if you want to make bonus good luck if you work in MD have to move to the commonwealth
good,"The job is pretty simple; however, the weekends and holidays are a lot busier and stressful. Sometimes the job in general is highly stressful. As the face of the restaurant, guests tend to take their frustrations out on you if you have to maintain a wait list. Takes a lot of patience, communication, and customer service skill to hold it down. There are no busser positions here, so more often than not, the hostess ends up having to help servers bus tables in order to seat guests faster and get through the wait list. Many times you have to choose between making the guests or server/kitchen staff angry."
good,"Back of house doesn’t get paid enough, servers shouldn’t make double the pay cooks/prep/dish people get. Good management and fun environment. Weekends and holidays get crazy busy, like we start running out of items"
good,"One can make decent money here on the weekends especially.  It's very fast-paced, and there are no bussers.  You are responsible for making sure all tables are clean."
good,"I like the job, coworkers are fun. Could be better and be more fair with the employees. Clientele isn’t always the best either, but good place to work"
good,"I had to take them to court for underpayment."
good,managers changed so often. Didn't like listening to employees. Employees didn't like working together.  Working as QA you got a free meal. They feed you through training. The kitchen isnt as clean as it should be. They started using a certain criteria for picking your section of tables that was awful. Could be a great server yet get put in the baby section due to numbers.
good,"Company doesn't exactly care for it's people, would replace you in a heartbeat but expects you to work like a dog and to go above and beyond with lack of pay or advancement."
good,It's an alright place to work the managers could do and be better other than that it's a good place to start off if you want to be in the cooking business
good,"Honestly, the pay sucks, the hours suck, the management is kinda lame, co-workers are rude, constantly stressed. Not a great environment for someone someone with mental health issues."
good,"I worked at Chili’s in Charlotte NC for 1 year. It is a okay place to work."
good,It paid my Bill's but wasnt anything special. I worked hard and long hours for a while then got burnt out fast had to go down to part time to keep my sanity
good,"Each day, you deal with many different families. You handle money, drinks, and food. You need to always be on your toes, you never know when the pace will be picked up or not. You have to make sure each guest is happy and is given great service. And always remember, have a smile on your face."
good,"un dia tipico se prepara alimentos antes de comenzar un turno con mucho volumen de clientes ya que las ventas son altas se aprender organizar y pronosticar cuanto se puede gastar y ganar durante un turno, mejorar tiempo de salidas de servicio y tratar de tener el mejor ambiente"
good,"working here is ok i dont really care for it, this is just something to do while im still in school. hopefully this does not last to long cause this is not where i want to be"
good,"This chili's location is in desperate need of better management. "
good,I dedicated mys3lf to this company for over 2 years and was treated like trash when new management took it over. It was a wonderful place to work for 2 years and in 3 months with bad management it declined and became a horrible experience and memory
good,"If you like to work over 60 hour work weeks with no quality of life outside of work.   Going down a path of struggle between the importance of good leaders, and a body to fill a position."
good,"A day at Chili's wouldn't be right if everything went smoothly. Everyday there was a new challenge, from conflicted scheduling to customer satisfactory. Working in this environment has told me how to adapt quickly to unexpected events. The employees are what makes the environment great, great opportunity for workplace diversity."
good,Chilis is a chaotic fast paced restaurant. The benefits offered are not reasonable. It is a good weekend money booster but not something you would want to commit to full time. The amount of stress caused by the work environment is not worth the compensation.
good,Company's vision and market identity are inconsistent.  The direction of the company has changed over the past 5 years with added pressure on team members for business performance. Teams are left to figure it out on their own.  Lesson learned are rarely transferable. Team members are simply a score with the use of unproven technology.
good,"chillis is a great place to work if you are good with an extremely fast paste environment, great management team, but to make money you have to work a lot"
good,Co-workers were lazy and never completed their job requirements.  Management did not discipline their employees for lack of work.  As a host I was picking up the slack for the front end of the restaurant with little to no support from management.
good,I loved my co workers. I was offended by one of my managers and the comment that was said when i was 7 months pregnant and wasnt able for a promotion due to my situation.
good,"It's a good place to earn work experience and make money. Expect to have a terrible time though. Sometimes the employees/managers can be friendly, which makes the job easier."
good,the management is very unpredictable and they are never on the same page.  The guests are usually pretty nice and fun to work for. Most of the staff is friendly
good,Fast paced but fun work environment. Everyone is young and willing to do whatever it takes to get the job done. Food is great and always great to interact with the guests.
good,"I was told before hiring that as a hostess I'd be getting paid much more than the actual pay I received. Hostesses get 1% of tips at the end of the night after it's all said and done.. I thought maybe that would help make up a little for the lower wage pay. In all reality, it only ended up being chump change to take home which usually went to gas to get to and from work anyway. The busiest days were on the weekends, which took away from any plans etc you may have had due to you having to make some decent money."
good,I was a line cook mangers were disrespectful told the general manager about it he didn't care so I found another job and left the restaurant named chilis
good,You had good day and bad days .It was nice when you did have help from manager lack of managers.Learned  to Team work.Loved when customers left with a smile on there face.
good,The actual job was okay. But it was the staff and management were the problem. The managers halfway followed the rules so they would extend certain rules to certain customers which made it unfair for others.
good,"It's great for some money, and learning opportunity."
good,Hardest part was knowing i wasn't going to get a promotion to management or assistant management. I was the server and bartender yet I still had to buss tables.
good,"Working at Chili's was very stressful. Always busy, multiple tasks to do at once, a lot to remember. I learned a lot from working here however it was a lot to take in. I gained life long friendships and many skills I can take with me throughout life. Competitive work environment."
good,"It was almost impossible to get promoted if management didn't like you  I was scolded for taking vacation time during the holidays,  also management didn't agree on the same things so it was hard to follow orders."
good,"I worked at the Chili's on FSU's campus and although my serving coworkers were mostly enjoyable to work with, management and the kitchen staff were not. Management would not willingly come help the front of the house when we were in need of management approval or just an extra set of hands. Service was very slow from the kitchen. There was no sense of urgency from the cooks and when asked for the food in the window, they would respond with attitudes. There's a lot of sidework at the end of the night, and the customers are students, faculty, and parents, so there is a lot of potential to make money but many students are utilizing their meal plan card and fail to tip properly."
good,"cheap food and sales =low checks= low tips +1$ and change an hour = not enough money to live. coworkers are friendly and willing to help you. management are friendly but behind closed doors they talk about people. they know what they are doing but things seem off. hardest part is maintaining handling multiple tables at once and catering to every customers needs. sanitation in the work place isn't so up to par. no one washes their hand regularly and touches everyones food. the gross part is the desert/coffee spoons if they have a something encrusted on it, instead of putting it back in dish they just scrape it off with unwashed hands and gives it to the customer."
good,I was hired as a bartender and after management realized they hired too many bartenders my hours started to decrease and was offered serving shifts instead.
good,"Greeted and seated customers.  Trained new hosts/hostesses, did some light cleaning.  I also would help the food servers when they were slammed, and also sold gift certificates to customers."
good,"working at chilis is difficult, if you are in a specific type of financial situation it came be a temporary relief due to its abbility to provide funds after every shift."
good,"it's work its hard work for little pay. no full time. can wear what you like. have to wear hate, no nail polish. benefits are given to full time but no full time possibility."
good,Duties were clearly outlined. Management was available to help when needed. Scheduling was light with bus boy and stock work shared across too many people.
good,"With any restaurant you have to expect some chaos and drama. I feel like chilis had a lot more of that than anywhere else I have worked. Low clientele which meant low tips. Poor management which meant the employees were always mad. I had my good and bad days. Overall, I learned a lot from working there."
good,"the only thing bad about chilis, is being under staffed and working more hours then you should be working and days you need off. they would have you work a lot of double shifts"
good,They need to treat employees better. People call out every day so were always short staffed affecting the kitchen so food always comes out slow and cold. Management schedules you out of your availability. There needs to be a lot of changes.
good,"Working there was fun at times, but stressful due how employees would get along with each other. Weekends were usually the hardest due to the increase in business."
good,This Job was a great way for me to make money while putting myself through college. It is also a great place to meet new and exciting people and interact with them in their day to day lives.
good,I worked at the strip location so everyday was different. Management were very helpful and involved. Coworkers were competitive in work place but great friends outside of work. Working as a team was difficult. Everyone was out for themselves. Corporate made it difficult to work at times when they come.
good,"As Chili's was my first job it taught me alot! If you do not like impatient and rude customers waiting to be sat or standing and speed walking or having long periods of slow activity, this would not be the job for you. I believe it is a great first job for high school students or college students as they pay fairly and the hours are easy."
good,"Probably one the most stressful jobs I've ever had. No teamwork, I never had a chance to feel comfortable with the procedures before they threw me to the sharks, and the sections were huge. It just was't a good fit for me. I would rather have time to get to know my guests."
good,I wanted to work full time but that is hard in the restaurant business. It almost seems impossible to grow there unless you are super passionate about the restaurant business.
good,The crowd varies so be prepared to either be very slow or slammed. there was lack of communication between the front and back of house and diversity amongst the managing on any given shift
good,"Fast paced and upbeat setting, incoming business is slowing. Some poor management, one particular manager changes rules to benefit herself. Pays well when it's busy but you work hard for the money you make."
good,"Fast paced restaurant where you have to know every aspect of the job.  Hosting, serving, cooking, prep work in addition to management duties.  Can get very stressful during peak hours."
good,"A typical day at work was very fast pasted, stressful, and busy at all times. Management was decent. The hardest part of my job was not making very good tips because of how much each tip out was. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to interact with customers and other employees."
good,Overall I loved the beginning years at Brinker but the management and direction of the company went the wrong way and I decided to leave for better opportunities.
good,"Chilis needs better managers. I love the other employees but the managers drive away most of the really good employees. Firing procedures need to be more clear, if it is on a 3 strike basis give 3 strikes not 2 or 1."
good,"Great Money as a server/Bartender Once promoted to management that all changed. Long hours always short on staff, hard to manage when the people above you dont believe in you. Grateful for the experience"
good,"Must be motivated and quick. Unorganized at times and favoritism. Quick easy money, if your good at your job, but little help from management at times."
good,was okay working there. didn't give much raises and the mangers are great but the Gm was another story he was rude and selfish and a not a team player but besides him I learned to be a cook and made friends and the managers were team players and understanding was okay working there
good,"Chili's has a tendency to overwork their employees BUT you are paid what you work for (FOH staff). Hourly staff is severely underpaid. Management rarely pitches in to help but the strong, seasoned employees make up for the incompetent management team."
good,This was a job for me to just start out serving. It was a fun first serving job and the people there were awesome. Always come back and visit though so I did love the place.
good,Money to be made right now but with bar and grills losing guest interest could be a dwindling concept. Had some good years traveling opening restaurants
good,"On a typical workday, you can either expect it to be very slow or very busy. There is no in between. You only make money during the busy times and more often than not it is chaotic and the pay is not guaranteed. State of North Carolina for some odd reason allows employers to pay their employees less than half of minimum wage on serving type jobs. You have to completely rely on your tips. The serving industry here in this state is not a stable at all and should be changed. I personally don't recommend working at a restaurant like Chili's in this state. If you are to serve I suggest finding an upscale restaurant where the average check is higher than the norm."
good,While I was working at Chili's in Alamosa I was able to make great tips meaning that I was making good money for a waitress. It was a fast pass and no stopping. I was expected to know the full menu as well as know how to deal with an upset customer. Most of the waiting staff became best friends and spent most days off together.
good,Chili's was a great filler job while I was in search of a career.  If you are a great server you will make a good amount of money that will ensure that your daily needs are met.
good,"Being QA was either stressful or incredibly boring depending on the day, weather, time of year, etc. I frequently helped other workers because there was no need for a QA when it was slow. Hours can be a bit inflexible but if you wanted to learn a certain job, all you had to do was ask."
good,You will work. Upper management is very unstructured. Systems are very old you are thrown to the wolves many times only the strong survive. Great learning exp if you can stick it out.
good,"Typical shifts consisted of assuring quality of food, food prep, and taking and putting together takeout orders"
good,"Personally work Ethics were Terrible. The Restaurant was Nearly always Dirty. Not enough business. Managers seemed Confused. Lack Of Communication. "
good,The work life balance to job depends on your position. Servers have to meet scores and HOH employees usually have it the worst than the front depending on your restaurant and coworkers. Some work as a team while others care more about making their quotas
good,When I started working at Chili's the restaurant was doing pretty well and I was making money. Now that they've changed management it has gone downhill. They don't hire responsible/capable servers or cooks and they don't appreciate the ones that haven't quit yet.
good,my day at chillis can be challenging at times but i do what ever comes my way to get the job done in a timely fashion and always busy but keep a positive attitude and for myself and my team members.
good,"A typical day would include making food all day long but with little to no appreciation shown from the managers and little structure when it comes to keeping their employees on track and working together as a team. The managers played favorites among their workers making the work environment non-enjoyable if you weren't apart of the favored. The hardest part of the job was staying interested when things fell apart structurally. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my hands, making the food for the costumers."
good,"Very great place, great managers and people to work with. Overall easy job, something I enjoy and don't mind going to. I meet new people everyday, some are nice and some not so nice, but still worth it."
good,Not good system low salary no insurance no breaktime no free meal they are cutting my time im a PR immigrant her in canada and looking for any partime position
good,"Chilis environment always gave me the feeling like I needed to do something, I tried to find anything I could do just to make the presentation of the place look good"
good,I did flat top cooking and fry cook. The hoyrs were long with no breaks at all. It was a easy job because I love to cook but no room for advancement. The houra always changed from week to week.
good,A stressful environment full of rude and uncooperative people. Have knowledge of what you're doing otherwise you will be shamed for it. They fire easily
good,"Good place to start a career, its fun because of the people you work with. Most part is you get to meet new kind of people every single day and for me its a good challenge."
good,"Its extremely hard to work here for one you don't make enough money to deal with the people you will be forced to deal with on a daily basis, and two the managers were horrible with understanding some people have extreme anxiety. They almost expect too much out of you wanting you to buss do chores other people are hired to do  I quickly left this place and found a much better job the food is okay but a tad bit over priced."
good,the restaurant was okay. the management and training of staff needs extreme help. Some of the staff is welcoming but not others.
good,"Typical day at work consists of helping guests as they come into the restaurant. As a hostess I greeted guests, sat them, and helped my coworkers when necessary. I provided open counts for the kitchen frequently. As a to-go specialist, I greeted guests and took orders in person as well as over the phone, and rang them into the computer system and then made sure the food came out correctly for the guest. I also handled payments. Management changed very frequently in my location. My location is on its third GM in almost 2 years, which in my opinion is not good. Current management does not seem to care about us as employees. Coworkers are like family. Hardest part of the job is dealing with the stress and not being able to please every customer when the food comes out wrong or is taking too long. Corporate also only cares about results. Most enjoyable part is the discount card and my coworkers are like family."
good,Easy place to work for a second job but company does not care about employees. Great place to get started in food industry and co-workers are easy to get along with.
good,Unfortunately upper management isnt great but some management is. Upper management just cares about numbers and money honestly. They prefer slower rushed service over an open table.
good,At chili's i was just a host.I already knew much of being a host. My managers weren't so nice all the time but it was a quiet environment & I'm a quiet person.
good,Nick job security.  They preach how they are all about their employees and will take care of you but it's another story working there. You are u still a number and if you don't produce your out of a job. It's definitely more high pressure sales instead of fun work environment.
good,For the most part management was creepy and adnvacement came to those they preferred. Made decent money in tips but hourly wage is awful (as expected from a server)
good,"I learned a great deal here.  The product is not the quality it needs to be.  I had a hard time really loving my job.  The hours are hard, and locations can be hard to move to and from all the time."
good,this is a great job and only became an undesirable job when a new manger took over. best job ever until new manager arrived
good,"It's overall okay. It's not the worst but when they hired me a full time position then give me ten hours, then it makes you a little angry."
good,Chilli's at MacArthur was a wonderful place to work however there is room for improvement I worked there for a year and had no raise the managers response was that money was going into supplies and it was true some of the minor supplies were getting trashed the overall workplace was great other than that it could be better I worked hard to get that far in the company I started from the bottom with the anticipation to grow within the company I was terminated because I had to catch the last bus that would take me home so I ended up not finishing my work which was trash cans being placed on the patio and the floors
good,You must be able to handle high-stress environments and work a fast pace. As well as learn proper recipe builds and be able to work as a team.
good,My experience seems to be that the trickle down effect from management doesn't go over to well for the entire restaurants benefit.
good,"Lots of cleaning alone and always smelling like food. Some managers were more helpful than others, didn't work with you when you needed help going threw things."
good,"Regardless of what day, you were busy! Great opportunity to make money if you are willing to work hard for it! Also great networking workplace!"
good,"Server, Bartender, To-Go, Trainer & Host: This company is a fast paced job with flexible hours and quick cash. It can be a long term or short term position. The company offers benefits."
good,Working at Chili's help me build my communication skill because if you couldn't understand what the customer wanted to order and you end up putting it in wrong you will have one mad customer. Your job was to make sure the customer has an enjoyable dining out experience.
good,"great work enviroment,  but management was the problem when things are not working and you take it to higher authority first the GM gets upset and get rid of the employee"
good,"I loved working for chili's other than my managers. I was there for 7 months and lost my job for serving a 21 year old alcohol. But sense I didn't show my manager her completely valid ID I got fired. Most of the managers at the location I worked for were unapproachable, and had horrible communication skills. I got hurt and was able to go back to work a week later and they kept me off the schedule for 3 weeks. Then only let me roll silverware 2 days a week 4 hours a day, every now and again I would get lucky and they would let me serve. They don't care if your pay is messed up even if you show them hard evidence that it should of been different.  I'm a business major with a 3.95 GPA and I graduate in less than a year. I have wonderful attendance. Plus I'm a member of Phi Beta Lambda and have been for 2 years. Everywhere I get employed  don't want to work around my school and study schedule."
good,"un buen dia en el restaurante es cuando llegas con muchas ganas de hacer las cosas bien y te encuentras con toda la gente que tambien tien las mismas ganas de trabajar y empezar el dia bien aprendi a trabajar en equipo que siempre es bueno la ayuda de alguien y siempre vamos a necesitar de alguien aprendi a ser tolerante cada vez mas debido a las diferentes personalidades de las personas esa fue la parte mas dificil de todo el proceso puesto que los clientes cada vez son mas exigentes, lo que mas me gusto fue haber podido hacer muchas relaciones publicas con muchas personas las cuales me ayudaron y a las cuales yo ayude en el transcurso de mi estadía en esa empresa."
good,"I begin the shift by opening up the bar and prepping the fruit and liquor for the day. The hardest part of the job is that our store is usually understaffed, so certain hours of the day can be very stressful. However, this could also be the best part of the job. My co-workers, managers and I, really come together in stressful times and work really hard to help each other."
good,"Handling store Inventories (weekly & monthly), Proper Ordering of goods to supplier.   Data entry of receiving & issuing of each department. Preparing indents. Monitoring, receiving, issuing and maintaining stock. Dealing with vendors. Responsible for security and safety of stock. Checking other reports like GRN (MRN) & DRR. Responsible for Bills payments.  Responsible for Purchase, Vendor Development.  Verification of Vendors Bills with Rates, Monthly Purchase bills passing to Accounts Department, Responsibility to make availability of every material in food & beverage and operational and liquor stock"
good,My job was easy and enjoyable. Not a job I would make a career out of but defiantly a reliable position for temporary employment
good,"A typical day at work consists of preparing for the scheduled shift that was assigned to you, such as prepping silverware, prepping food, taking orders accurately, sitting customers, etc. The management was a wonderful team when I first started in 2010, however, management soon changed, therefore, the atmosphere at Chili's was overwhelming and non-caring, were before, it was a place where management cared about the employee's well-being. Many co-workers came and went, but working with them was a wonderful experience. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the fast pace, although I was new to restaurant environment."
good,A typical work day would involve coming into the restaurant at a busy hour and immediately jumping in to help my fellow co-workers which would have 7-8 plus tables. I would help them catch up as when new guest arrive I would start to take over greeting and taking the new guest as my own. I worked with a lot of hard working people who most would help you out when the time came. The hardest part of the job would be the lack of number of employees needed to help run the lounge in a smooth and reasonable manner at busy hours. Help would always arrive an hour too late and management would never come help the lounge. I enjoyed working with my co-workers in a team setting and conversing with the guest ensuring they had a pleasurable stay. Management wise it was okay. We had really good ones and a couple that could care less about their employees.
good,I would take care of front of house customers and make sure that they had a wonderful experience while they were there. Also key was a key manager which I made sure all front of house employees are doing a good job.
good,"Not many benefits unless you are in management, and management only cares about numbers and not the employees.  The focus on numbers really comes from being such a large company and numbers is that can be tracked by the corporate office.  No one cares if the employees are happy, but only if they are under on labor and costs."
good,"In the 2 years I've worked for this company I've experienced 3 new general managers. They all have different expectations for their staff. The most enjoyable part of the job is keeping customers satisfied and making very good tips. The hardest part would be the long hours of being on your feet, no breaks, the lack of teamwork, fast pace, and conflict with peers or customers. Have been offered management within the company several times by GM's and regional manager. Difficult to work for this company. I've learned a lot about respect for others, conflict management, multitasking, and being fast paced on your feet."
good,"A typical day at work was getting in, cleaning up the back as well as my section. Waiting on tables, helping other servers, training new servers, keeping food going out whether it was my table or not. At the end I would have to clean my section as well as part of the back kitchen area. I learned a lot about customer service at this job. Whether you get a friendly table or not, you always know the customer is correct. Also time management considering you may go from 3 customers to 10 in a matter of minutes and you have to be on your toes and handle it with grace. The management was pretty good, I always got along with the management as well as the employees. The hardest part of the job was trying to keep everyone happy and focused when it was really busy. I always tried to be the calming one, and that was difficult at times when everyone was in a rush. The most enjoyable part of my job was training the new employees, I loved doing that. When you train them, you know you can teach them the best system of doing things in a timely manner so that you can still help others. That way when you are trying to help other, and the person you taught knows how to do the same thing, it makes things run a lot more efficiently."
good,Chillis is a great place for college students as a part time job the work load is heavy but as regards to the experience you can learn marketing skills and  culinary skills
good,"A typical day at work in the server world is of providing your tables with the best customer service you can. I would greet the tables with a smile on my face, take their drink orders, suggest a couple of appetizers, and then go get their drinks to ensure they had enough time to think about an appetizer, and look for their entrees. if that particular table needed some more time, i would make my rounds to make sure my other tables had full drinks, were eating happily, or needed their checks. Once all was well i would return to that table take their orders, put the order in, and make sure the food was made promptly. i usually check back after couple of bites to make sure everything is up to par, and check if they need refills.Once i see that they are about 75% done with their meals, ill suggest a dessert. if they decline dessert, i usually drop off their check. Not to rush them out the door, but as a convenience to them. That way whenever they are ready, its all set. One thing i love about the restaurant/customer service industry is that you come across so many people. with that being said you have to adapt to whatever is thrown at you. you learn to solve problems quickly and you can tune your skills to make sure the problem never happens again. The management was awesome at some points but because they had the government as their boss, some times they would be stressed out, and wouldn't be able to give their focus, they way i think management should. My co-workers were fantastic, they ended up being my best friends which ultimately made up for the management because if the guests"
good,"Although it might be somewhat fun place to work because of some other co-workers respect and friendship, is a loud unprofessional and unguided Workplace; Where the Managers get too touchy with the female servers/table attendants. And where they give more chances to work to the people who do not deserve it. After I finish my work I cleaned my work area and even did some extra work without getting paid so the establishment owner can come to the store and find everything clean and organized, I was dropped to Maximum of 15 hours a week from 25 hours minimum that I was told to be. And the other people who were fighting and braking plates and not following even the basic rules of the workplace, were given up to 45 hours a week."
good,I like the people i work with  and the coustmers.making new freinds
good,"Serving people is fun and exciting at first, but after a while it can become tiring and monotonous. Pay is good at first, but tips start to thin out because the restaurant business is seasonal. Once all the snow birds leave, so does the money."
good,"Good job for college students. Good work environment. Fun at times, but a lot of hard work for very little pay."
good,it was alot of fun waiting on customers you meet alot of different of people sometimes you got some rude guest but overall it was a cool est.
good,Prepare and serve meal to company specifications. Train new employees to accurately produce quality goods and services. I learned how to effectively manage my time and employee to ensure each guest had a great experience. Management did not provide an essential time management balance or essential fundamentals to properly identify and fix on going issues reported. The hardest part of the job was maintaining a high level of  quality service as there was an over bearing amount of work to be done with minimal tools and assistance. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing guests leave happy as we went above and beyond their service expectations.
good,"Managment wasnt the best."
good,"Clock in ,get the prep list do all the prep we need clean everything and then we re done."
good,I worked for 3 Chili's over a 10 year period. It has been fun at times and stressful also. There is constant change in the menu and a lot to learn about food and drinks. Other than that its an ok place to work if you are a college student which I was when I started. You can make good money depending on your availabilty and the store location.
good,"A typical day at work was very stressful, but for the most part short. I learned a lot about waiting tables and learning how to deal with customers of all ages and personalities. Each manager was not only a completely different page than another, it was a completely different book. My coworkers were great and most of them were great at teamwork. The hardest part of the job was never knowing what you would make that day or how busy it would be. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the friends that I made along the years of working there."
good,"Job very intense at times, overworked, under paid, physically taxing"
good,"Greet new guests, exceed their expectations and ""own"" the experience."
good,"The work is the same at any hosting job unless we're understaffed. When understaffed the hostess takes on the duties of a server and and expo. The managers are very unfair to the employees that are not ""favorites"". Co-workers are rude and do not work as a team. There is nothing enjoyable about this job. Its a terrible place to work."
good,The company is a great company to work for  as long as the management team is good. The company as a whole values their employees but they have a few problems with favoritism among the management staff. 
good,"Teamwork is lacking, Benefits were cut, turnover is high,"
good,Small not so busy restaurant. management team great to work with. just needs everyone to have same standards
good,"very nice people ,great food, and good cutomers, the job was very easy with a very fast pase"
good,"Not a bad place to work, however, working a forty hour week is absolutely unheard of."
good,"I started as an hourly TM and was promoted to management in two years or so. Lots of hoops to jump through to get there. Average pay to start and they tell you most of your raises come through bonus increases and strong performance. Was promoted to GM after 4 years or so. Very strong support center and a lot of people to call if you need assistance with something. A lot of leadership has left over the past 4 years and there are growing concerns on the culture shift in the brand at restaurant level as well as above restaurant leadership. Ultimately got very political towards the end and if you had any kind of questions about some standards being enforced and some not you were considered negative and not the ""yes"" man. Very demanding schedule and hours especially if you have children. Must be willing to go days without seeing them or spouses. Overall I enjoyed my time with Chili's and the people were great."
good,"I enjoy all the other servers and that's why I stay but the management isn't the best at times, and you have to put up with a lot. You don't really get paid enough for all the work you have to do."
good,"This job was interesting to say the least, I’ll be real the managers were not all that great but my co workers were amazing, I learned how to cope with average managers."
good,It was a great place to learn how to prioritize and how to get the most done in one walk to and from each side of the restaurant. It was a great place to make money fast just your best money making days were the times you wanted to spend with your own family.
good,I struggled with a lack of solid management. Managment changed frequently and so did the atmosphere in the staff as a result. Lack of positive management led to my choice to leave. Other than that I greatly enjoyed my job! I love cooking good food for people. I loved the pace of a solid busy service. My first store was an amazing location and team. I wish I could have stayed.
good,"Chili's is for people who are trying to get money and need a 'in between"" job. No one I worked with seriously needed the hours, they were there for a ""I want money now"" thing."
good,"During the weekend, it constantly busy and the stress continued to build up. We were also extremely understaffed at the host position so I worked way than I was hired to do."
good,"Great company, efficient kitchen, clean kitchen, great coworkers, amazing food,flexible schedule, family friendly, opportunity to advance, great management team!"
good,"It okay to work there, just what happens at work at work.Come in with the mindset to work because it do get very busy out of nowhere. Over all tho, its a cool place to work."
good,"Just like any corporate company, there's ups and downs. You might have to stay late some days and work weekends remotely from home. Lots of work so it can be stressful."
good,"Once a young guy at our location tried to request off on a weekend it was going to be busy. Our managers disregarded him, although he had earlier that month let them know he would be attending a family FUNERAL!!!"
good,"Decent company to work for but, also make you feel as though you don’t matter with the way they let guests talk to employees. There are very good things about working here but, definitely more cons that should be addressed"
good,"would not recommend working at chilis. Constantly understaffed, inconsistent  management. It was also a very slow restaurant, so it was hard to make money"
good,"The managers were really nice and considerate to the situation of my father being in the hospital at the time of being employed there. The food was great especially since I got a discount. I got a decent amount of hours there, they had too many hostesses hired at the time of my employment. One time I went to work for a 7-hour shift and they sent me home 20 minutes in. I was so irritated and wished I didn't drive 2 hours from a family function to be at work. They could have at least called me so I didn't have to come in. It is an okay place to work but, every place has its flaws."
good,People based on my experience were not team players. The people who were there for years are obviously much older and did not like helping the new people learn much. One of the managers was just rude to me because I was younger.
good,"Depending on your needs; Chili’s isn’t that bad. If you are a high school/college student needing money and need a job to work with your school schedule then it is fine. However the upper management is awful. A few managers I worked with were great on a personal level. Most managers only cared about bonuses so don’t expect to be set up for success. All in all, I would say my time at Chili’s was decent. Many coworkers I expect to be lifelong friends but I would not recommend it to anyone who is looking to advance of have a career in the service industry."
good,"Large company with great food and vibes. Lacking in stability and actual problem solving. Unlike most other casual dining chains, Chili's is unwilling to grow out of the 90's mindset of growth."
good,"The culture of the store has changed in the past 6 months and it's starting to effect my pockets. I'm sure it will improve, but at the moment, I can't wait around for it."
good,I managed chilis. The staff was my favorite part. Managment not so much many things swept under a rug. The culture was only follwed when thenhire ups were coming into town.  When personal emergencies happened very little sympathy was given.
good,"Chili's is decent job, if you like the fast pace and the none stop moving/cooking then Chili's is the right job for you,. Chili's pay nice if you work the night shift. Managers kept quitting, Chili's was losing money everyday because certain food would be Missing, Chili's don't not appreciate the good employees they have. Chili's don't like giving their good employees raises."
good,"host, wait tables, help with to go area when no one is present in area, buss tables, grab dishes to help set every station up, and clean restaurant during closing times and shift changes as well as during."
good,You tend to get overworked at this place and its a joke to ask for a break. This applies to all chili's in SoCal. I'm a part timer but I typically work 40 hours a week. This sounds good to a lot of people. but not when you do tons of manual labor and have no break fro 8 hours straight.
good,"I truly did enjoy my time at chili’s, but the management is my main reason for me leaving the company and never see myself returning any time soon. Wouldn’t recommend for full-time."
good,If the management was better it would be a pretty good work experience. The GM there drains the moral of the workers. There’s a high turnover rate because of him
good,Most of my issues with chili's comes from a specific location rather than the company as a whole. Management at my location had a hard time balancing all of their employees because so many of them left so quickly. There would be several days in a week where 90% of the staff would be working a double and therefore breaks would be difficult to negotiate due to a shortage of workers.
good,I like working at chilis because it is calm and layed back but a bit too calm about people constantly being late and not getting in trouble. When hosts bus tables they are  supposed to get tipped but none of the servers give us tips and the management expects us to bus every single dirty table and get mad when we complain.
good,I wanted to try something new so I decided on hosting. I liked it at first but I slowly dreaded going to work when I was scheduled. I was overworked and then asked to cut back on hours for school and then I was hardly working. No tips even when completely bussing tables for a server.
good,I worked at chili’s for a year and was treated very poorly. I constantly did more than needed and help out more than often I and was never appreciated for any of my work. After a year your supposed to get a raise and never got it and if you learn a new position your supposed to get a raise I learned the whole line and was scheduled for the zone and still never got a raise I asked about it and got ignored. I couldent even talk to my manger with out him shooting me a away and he wouldent alow me to bring outside drinks in but would allow the servers to bring In whatever they wanted.
good,"I had a unique opportunity to be involved in Corporate Training initiatives and really enjoyed the ""train the trainer"" sessions and various charitable events that the company was involved in."
good,There are good days and bad days. Some employees are awful and some managers just don't care. Makes it difficult to work there. If people cared more than it wouldn't be as bad.
good,My experience was fun I loved my job I washed dishes took out trash just like doing house work easy piece of cake made good hours and worked six days a week
good,The management is all over the place the scheduling is horrible they don't work around your schedule they get mad when you have to request a day off for something personal
good,"You hardly get hours if there are multiple hosts but when there is no host you are overworked, management doesn't help you unless they are just standing at the door to make themselves look good. Servers expect you to do everything for them even when it is not in your job description."
good,Overall chilis what was and still is a great place to work management come and go teaming help you a lot . You meet different people every day.. that's why I love my job serving
good,"Better than some other chain restaurants. But the distribution of wealth for servers and bartenders is a little wonky and not based on corporate number scores. Everything is based on whether the manager likes you and the chances to “move up” from host or QA to server or from server to bartender are slim to none, even though in theory there are plenty of shifts."
good,Chili's helped me with the knowledge to succeed in a busy environment and prepare me for life challenges.  I enjoyed getting to interact with my guests an ensure that they have the right experience in my four walls.
good,"We are like a family, in the back. But certain managers are out to get the hardworkers (myself included) and its causing the hardworkers to start to leave."
good,servers are not treated fairly. management plays favorites. not organized well cannot handle busy times in an efficient manor. guests end up suffering
good,Company is proud of the brand and provides a lot of activities and events for employees. Leaders could provide more feedback and development to help career growth.
good,"I had a blast working for Chili’s, some managers are better then others. And the foh team we had were great as well. "
good,"Can be a fun place to work, the employees tend to not get along and make it stressful to work. When it is busy it makes it easier to work and makes the shift go by faster"
good,I went into work ready to wow people and bring them in over and over because the felt like family not. Customer. I have dealt with many types of people as managers and I never give up or quit for them. I'm strong and proud of my work ethic. I was cornered into a decesion to leave my home that was work. I loved it but the management team I felt had failed me. I had given so man faithful years to be led astray s I was only a number on the roll. The team work we stood for was no longer.. .I finally had enough. No team no I.
good,the management team needs to have a good head on their shoulders and understand the stress level of a server. they need to back up their team and support highly. especially through hard times
good,Decent place to start a job career if you're young and in or attending highschool. Must thrive for manager position for better pay. An individual will not make a living other wise.
good,"Chili's used to be a top notch company to work for but their recent changes in menu and cooking style have decreased the quality of food in my opinion. Lucky for the current staff, it appears that the public still likes their menu."
good,"Ambiente dinámico, desempeño con atención a clientes."
good,"They where not will to pay team members who where there for years and so they when some where else. when i became manager i got the pay for cook raised to 12$ starting and servers where making 18$-21$ per person."
good,"Pretty laid back company to work for. Good servers, good side-money. Learn the menu and it could be a pretty good starting position for a server. Not too much side work."
good,Every day is a hustle to keep up.. Everyone works independently to help themselves but at the end you have to pick up the load. Guests come first in any situation.
good,"Could be better. I worked there way too long. It paid the bills when needed, but no where for advancement. I recommend any college student to work at a place like Chilis to make their money."
good,"I really don’t have much to say because it was years ago that I worked there , hopefully the management and staff has gotten better . I was overworked literally , I had a hospital visit and the doctor told me my body was exhausted and that’s why I fainted"
good,A lot was needed to be done with short staffing. I enjoyed working there but they need to really work on the managing skills. A lot of personal issues were discussed without being pertinent to the workplace.
good,"Fantastic coworkers they were an absolute joy to work with. Fast paced always busy environment, relatively good team work when thins became hectic. Management would help occasionally, however those of us in the back were left to our own devices most of the time. I was the first of my shift to arrive and usually the last to leave, the hours were the worst part of the job, the easiest was the actual cooking and prepping of food. Overall not a fun work experience, but would not turn anyone who needed a job off to the company."
good,"Overall all staff are great to work with as a team. Different promotions that corporate mandates are awful for servers, bartenders and expos tip wise and also very time consuming."
good,"I enjoyed working with my team , we all helped each other out to make the day go by smooth as possible. The management was great they knew how to have a good time and keep it professional as well . The most enjoyable part of my job was being a prep cook I really enjoyed cooking at the moment."
good,"It was an ok work experience,my former boss lied and said I was self employed which wasnt the case.The truth was is that I worked for him.It wasnt enough hours overall."
good,the job is cool. most of the people i would with are cool. on a typical day you would get about 6 tables and walk out of there with 50-70 dollars. over all not too bad
good,the managers very fun to work with except for the general managers very few of the employees including some of the managers are not fond f the general manager.
good,its ok... very flexible with a schedual...the team members ask to covers shifts every week...if your work night shifts youll be cleaning the kitchen and yea
good,"Chili's is a very team oriented place to work. How ever the problem with them is that they required the staff to do jobs that most restaurants hire for. As a server we are required to clean our own tables and run our own food. Most restaurants hire people to do that. Also, they want its servers to sell multiple different items to customers and get upset when sales are not satisfactory. However, we cannot control what the customer wants. We can only encourage them to try the promotional item. Aside from that, I find Chili's to have a fun, professional, and team oriented environment. Everyone supports each other and helps those in need when it becomes hectic. Management is very quick to take action on anything that goes wrong. If a problem arises in someones personal life, management is very quick to support those in troubled times. The hardest part of the job is having eight tables per server and having to clean your own area while providing top notch service to customers. Best part of the job is having a very supportive team that is glad to assist if they are not too busy as well."
good,"The job had the potential to be a lot more rewarding however local management simply did not have control of the establishment."
good,"I've had better jobs. They treated me like dirt. I never felt like part of the team. They always stuck me up front and, although I kept it very neat and clean, they always found something to get mad at me for. Very unappreciative."
good,worked here as a hostess for a year. asked for raise from minimum wage and was laughed at. Asked to be promoted to server and was again laughed at. Management kept their cool although they clearly do not have their employees interests at heart.
good,"A typical day is fast paced, constant multitasking and team work."
good,"Great staff, okay management. Great Food. The staff is like a bunch of high school teenagers, but what restaurant staff isn't? Kitchen staff is productive and efficient but not very helpful or friendly to newcomers."
good,"They didnt want employees to reach 40 hours or any overtime. It wasnt until i started that i found this out and the shifts are not consistent, they fluctuate daily."
good,"Not terrible, I definitely won't work for them again. I was degraded in front of customers and co-workers.i had to fight to get shifts covered or get days off. It wasn't the best place."
good,"Went through several managers the passed few years cant seem to keep any of them. No one is on the same page, no leadership, no follow through. No one seems to care. Hasn't always been that way and I'm sure one day it will be back to where it needs to be. However I don't have the energy to keep up with the stress to get there."
good,"the management definitely needs improvement , its a family that you build with co workers that makes it awesome  it is a fast pace environment . There is alot of favoritism that is petty when it comes to management . The clientele iis pretty good"
good,A typical day at work is walking in and it's either slow or extremely busy. Usually people are running all over the place or sitting down waiting for a table. I learned from this job that patience is very important to control. The management is okay sometimes. They could be very unfair and the management could be better. The hardest part of the job is bussing all the tables and getting to tables when your busy and doing all the side work after a busy night. The most enjoyable part of my job for me was singing happy birthday to the little kids and watching their faces light up.
good,"It's your average food place, if you've worked in a dinner before it's just like that, maybe a bit quicker than average, no benefits until you been there a year with a average amount of hours per week above 25 hours."
good,"es un restaurante muy concurrido por la gente en general (depende de la ubicación), es un lugar excelente para poder realizar diferentes metas en la vida a corto plazo, el ambiente laboral es muy variado ya que depende de como sea la gente que trabaje ahí y también tiene que ver mucho con el encargado del personal. Renuncie a mi trabajo porque me cambiaron a una tienda en donde hay muy poca venta y no me convino económicamente y solicite ayuda de recursos humanos y jamas me dieron solución, esto me desepciono mucho ya que jamas falle a mi trabajo. "
good,Chilis wasn't a horrible place to work but I  had higher aspirations. Being a server or just being in the service industry in general is a hard job with low respect. I would recommend this place for someone in college or just starting their careers in the food service industry.
good,"I do not approve of the way the restaurant i work at is managed. They play favorites and don't even bother to hide it. It almost the same anywhere you work but here it affects the way we work and how we make our money."
good,"At chilis you can make a lot of money but working as a bartender in a corporate setting almost takes away everything thats fun about bartending.  If you havent worked at both types of places, (Corporate vs. Small) You wont know the difference.  But youre allowed to have a lot morel fun at smaller places."
good,very high energy place to work with.  I was able to meet a variety of people and interact with them.  I thrive in social settings and welcome new experiences
good,"recognition lacking. performance not always rewarded with praise. each location varies as afar as expectations and accountability. I learned alot and worked under some really great general managers and directors, and some that were underperformers yet not held accountable"
good,"If you do not thrive in a stressful environment, if you do not have great time management skills, if you cannot multitask, if you do not have a great memory, you should not work here (and you probably shouldn't be a server at all). It is no better or worse than any other chain restaurant, but it is extremely busy.  Management is hit or miss depending on their mood that day and whether or not they like you. This is just the type of job where you have to accept the fact that every single day something is going to go wrong, at least one table is going to tip poorly, and you will want to pull your hair out by the end of the night. But, at least at this Chili's, most of your coworkers are rock stars and, if you can keep up, there is a TON of money to be made!"
good,Chili's was my first job and working as a dishwasher was a good experience it was a hard job but what made chili's work horrible was the management the manager did not care for the workers just himself. But other then that it is just another job.
good,"It wasn't a bad place to work, but they didn't let current employees advance when a position opened up. They liked to schedule employees with doubles."
good,"The availability of hours is good, but that is about it. Management enjoys micro management and squeezing as much work out of employees as possible with no hopes for reward."
good,Loved working at chilis just once the season ended in panama city beach florida they were cut throat. Promised atleast 30 hours a week during the off seson but once the off season came it was less than 20 hours a week..
good,"Trying to get out now! This place unfortunately has been turned so bad. It was fun to work here at first, and the money was good. Since new management and new coworkers have arrived, the restaurant has went down in every possible way."
good,"Chilis is an ok place to work, but there can be staggering long hours with little thanks or appreciation, but that is true of almost all severing jobs. Chilis is easy to get in to and quick to pick up but there is not a lot of room for advancement with any kind of speed."
good,Working at chillis made me realize why i dislike chain restaurants so much! the people and managers were awesome i just disliked the lack of customer service.
good,"ok its not a bad job more for younger people, fast pace almost everybody got alone. Was just to far of a ride to keep making, needed something closer."
good,"This company used to be a good place to work but they now expect management to run the dining room from the kitchen as you end up cooking almost every shift.  It is impossible to take care of your guests when you are not o/lin the floor overseeing the service they receive.  The schedules are done by the GM and then reviewed by the area director, and neither seems to care about their managers work/life balance.  Typical schedule is a close shift, then a mid, then an open shift...you can kiss those 3 days goodbye as all you have time to do is sleep and shower and do it all over again.  Wreaks havoc on the body and does nothing for productivity."
good,Just reopening after the flood and is working thru issues and trying to get back to their normal service. Good People and place to work.
good,I literally got no hours and the management sucked. They were dirty and the kitchen is nasty. They canceled most of my shifts and when I did work I did other peoples jobs on busy nights. I did not enjoy working here.
good,"A typical day at Chili's was very unpredictable. They constantly had front-of-house and heart-of-house staff calling in sick, or would be severely understaffed in the heart-of-house (kitchen area). It was fun but very, very stressful compared to any other job I have ever had, including other serving jobs I have had. I learned to take the job one day at a time and to be ready for complete chaos at any moment.  I got along with all of my managers just fine, however I did not always agree with how they did things. I especially did not like how they never took the chance to coach a negative experience into a positive learning experience. For example, if there was something wrong at a table, they would go over, take care of it, and never speak of it again. They wouldn't even inform us of checks they would discount, I would have to find out on my own. My coworkers for the most part were very good at trying to be there for each other when we needed it. The hardest part of the job was going in for a shift and trying to figure out how the shift was going to go, it felt like very rarely did a shift run smoothly like it should have. The most enjoyable part of this job was the people I got to meet and talk to and grow with, whether it was coworkers or guests or getting to know our ""regular"" guests."
good,"Working at Chili's has its ups and downs. The location in Liberty is understaffed most of the time. The patrons are usually pleased from our staff. Though, we do have had major problems with our back of house in the past."
good,The team players that we had there was good I love working at a fast pace Inland how to make a lot of prep food and how to have pieces when things don't go right love to everybody care for one another more willing to help one another
good,It was a fun job. I had good managers at all the stores i worked at. I bar tended and enjoyed it. You get what you put into a service job. They were clean well maintained buildings and equipment.
good,"Chili's has granted me with wonderful opportunities over the past 5 years. I have advanced to 4 different positions and was recently offered a management position, which I declined due to the ridiculous amount of hours they must provide for a small amount of pay. My management team does not communicate like they should amongst each other, resulting in the team members being frustrated and overwhelmed every shift. My team members and I love to make our guests happy and work extremely hard to live up to Chili's standards however, we don't have the right support we need."
good,"provided customer service, handle guest needs, bring food to table, take orders, bus tables, stock line, clean work area and etc"
good,This job was great for learning how to deal with guest and individuals that are looking for a direct service from you. Management was very emotional in their decision and not willing to work with individuals they didn't favor. Co-workers were very supportive with daily tasks though.
good,Waitressing is never glamorous but working at Chili's was pleasant. They worked with my schedule and I made pretty good tips working doubles and overtime.
good,"This was a great experience. I learned a lot while working for them, the company is very good. Very freindly place to work"
good,I enjoyed my interaction with guests and teammates. I decided to start a new career that I have a passion for. It is difficult to start a family with this schedule.
good,"I loved working here, very fun and upbeat. The management on the other hand wasn't the greatest, a few were very rude and talked down to employees in front of customers."
good,Working at chilis was pretty fun for me. Everyone was always busy doing something we had our times to work very hard and some not so hard like every job. This job was fun to an extent there was things i really did not appreciate this is why i left but other then that customers were nice co workers are always nice . Good place to work at.
good,"I worked there for two years, even though there was quite a turnover as far as management was concerned, it was an alright job."
good,"At typical work at day. Work under to much pressure, quality with the food, good relationship with managers and coworkers."
good,Fun atmosphere and a great job for people to start working. Just wasn't making enough money to live a fun lifestyle. Managers are great but don't ask for much there for can be a lazy atmosphere at times.
good,"Recipes changed quite a bit, which makes it hard to keep up with consistency. Friendly kitchen and wait staff. Always had a good time, even during dinner rushes. Didn't learn to much technique wise. A lot of food is pre made items."
good,I enjoyed working for Chili's and the flexibility it gave me.  The only problem I had was when the management changed.  The atmosphere changed and the restaurant was no longer the same.
good,I was responsible for taking all to-go orders. I made sure the meal was prepared and nothing was missing from the customer's orders.
good,"Overall poor work environment poor relationship with FOH and BOH No breaks"
good,"On a typical day, you would find me behind the dish machine or prepping food in the back of the restaurant. Some people would greet me hello and welcome me with smiles, others would stay to themselves. Which wasn't a problem. While I worked here, I learned how fast a restaurant really is in the back and how hard all of the workers work. It makes me appreciate them more and I understand how they feel if someone gets angry with them. As for management, I really didn't enjoy some of their attitudes. There were two managers on board who were willing to help me when I needed it. But, for only three weeks I had one day of training by someone who didn't speak English. I figured it out mostly on my own which was hard. I would say that was the hardest part of my job. Learning everything on my own with one day of training. The part I enjoyed was knowing that I was going to be able to learn something new everyday that I was there. The co workers were also the best part of my job.They were all so nice and willing to provide encouragement when I felt overwhelmed."
good,Everyday was a struggle in the kitchen. I learned  new ways to cook. managment was not always the best. It was hard to teach people who didnt care for the job. Hardest part of the job was dealing with rude people. Working the mornings when it was le employees.
good,This job is a faced pace restaurant. The team I work with do not get along. It seems to me that everyone is after each other
good,"a normal day would be going to Chili's in the morning to roll silverware before the restaurant opens at eleven, I check to see if they will have anyone Q-A the line and if not then I assist, and when the dishes get backed up in the pit, I sort them and run the dishes through the dishwasher, then I do full hands to the Q-A line. The hardest part about the job would be lack of support from other team members,and sometimes no accountability from other co-workers as well."
good,good for the industry. Good benefits for the type of people that do this kind of work. Typical cooking job.
good,"Chili's was a great experience and I met some really good people there, coworkers and customers."
good,"Delegating task to employes "
good,getting to work and starting with other hostesses is fun but then as soon as things got busy everyone became un organized and mean to each other. The stress would increase because I would try and make the customer happy and then if I had to double seat a waiter they would be angry with me and the manager would be happy with me. I would cry a lot under the pressures.
good,very busy and fast paced  especially during weekends. Time went by very fast and loved to stay busy.
good,Typical waiting job.  Long hours on my feet while multi tasking
good,"Typical day: open restaurant and work 4-6 hours twice a week."
good,Constant rush of people always made the shifts go by fast. I learned Quality is everything
good,es un trabajo entretenido poco divertido ie trabajado en otros restaurantes el trabajar para chilis fue una esperiencia no muy emosionante
good,I think it was a cool place to work it was something different for me as a host/togo/sever but it was fun I only left because i moved back to new york
good,Working with this company enhances my abilty to be flexible at any task given. It helps me develop my interpersonal skill as well as knowledge in leading people to work properly as per management standard. Enjoyed working as team in each branch to be with and considered my co worker as part of my achievement. Positively looking the difficulties as a stepping stone for growth.
good,"It has it's ups and downs, I suppose.  It's gotten worse since I started there, business and morale have taken a hit.  It'd be nice to not worry about making money there anymore."
good,"This is a very demanding job. There is really no Work/Life balance at all. It's pretty much all work. Extremely long hours. Great compensation and room for advancement. Health benefits are terrible. As with any restaurant job, there was a lot of backstabbing and drama. Area director for this area played favorites. Company expects so much from you and is not very understanding of having a home life. I had a lot of fun though on my shifts. Company has great concepts and initiatives. Consistency in policies and procedures though is lacking. I'd recommend this job to anyone who is willing to focus on nothing else in their life except their work and does not need good health benefits."
good,"start dishwasher, put trash bags in than start prepping food for cooks. The end of the catch up with dishes for night dish, finish prep list than clean kitchen and takeout trash"
good,I loved everything it was a fun up beat place to work. The people there are friendly but people get really stressed and tend to work slower but that just means i got to pick up the past and get more tables 
good,The business was very slow after the opening but plateued after a while. I was a laid back environment. Management did well motivating the staff each day.
good,Chili's company overall is fantastic. However the management from store to store is very different and can yield in some very erratic differences.
good,"A typical day at Chili's starts at 8 am, Set up the line make sure everything was working for opening shifts. You had 3 zones in the kitchen: fry station, grill station, and sald nacho. I learned all 3 zones in less then 4 months moved up quick in the kitchen. Management was okay just to friendly with employees. Co-workers are half and half you have your good hard workers and the lazy one. Myself hard worker but never did get awarded. They never awarded the HOH for hard work. Hardest part of the job it was an easy job. The most enjoyable part of the job was having fun each day."
good,"This ""once great"" company seems to have changed over the past decade. The appeal used to be it's culture and values as well as it's financial results, but it's only a shell of what it used to be."
good,Stable place to work. You really have to know your politics.
good,-my regular day at work is night shift but before we take my off i'm be coming morning.
good,"If everyone understood the fact that if a table doesn't tip that the server still has to tip out for that non tipping table then the work environment would be great. However it's hard to make money when one has to tip out of their own pocket to cover the cost of someone sitting at their table and leaving them nothing. If one can't afford to tip, one should either A) not go out or B) go thru a drive thru."
good,atención a clientes
good,"flexible hours, great for students,"
good,I liked the values of the company and I believe that the company could function better with better management at the store. I learned how to sale a little better because you are required to upsell everything.
good,"Typical day: ~4 hours of serving tables with ~1.5 hours of sidework, making an average of $10/hour in tips plus $3.63 hourly wage."
good,"If you like wearing brown stuff on your noseand don't have a mind of your own,or your a yes man no matter what. this one is for you"
good,"A great positive quality Chili's offers is that the management is very attentive to your concerns/issues. They will hear you out and do their best to make you happy. A huge negative is that I feel like I work tons of hours and don't make enough money. For the amount of time I spend their, away from my family, I only make about 1/3 the amount of money I made at my last serving job in half the time."
good,I personally didn’t like it but it could have just been my location. People tend to test your gangster a lot hoping you won’t do nothing. The managers tend to play favorites as well.
good,"The turnover rate was pretty low - most of my coworkers had been at Chilis for years, which means they must like the job enough. I had a tough time with management which ultimately made me leave."
good,"A typical day at work greeting guest, helping them to there table's and help maintaining by keeping bathrooms clean.I also went above and beyond helping the servers by taking drink orders and sometime food orders because managers didn't want to schedule the right amount of people so we STAYED SHORT STAFF. Management SUCKS!!!!! They are HORRIBLE at communicating with each other and employees. When help is needed managers sometimes are nowhere to be found. The hardest part of the job was trying to find managers when a table is not satisfied. The most enjoyable was all the different guest interacting with them and helping when I could and I made two really great friends. Also the MEXICANS are the best cooks there they normally work mornings that's when your food will on point."
good,The environment itself it's not bad it's like family but there is a but too much favoritism been there 12 and 1/2 years you think you would have seniority but you don't..
good,"I started at chili’s as quality assurance and quickly moved to the kitchen, the pay difference is $2 and hour. Very flexible. Raises infrequent. Be prepared to do a lot more work than quality assurance or cooking."
good,"Needed a job fresh from college and took the first one I got, I enjoyed the work for a time but the harder one works the more advantage they take of you, however that is true of much of the restaurant business."
good,"Management sucks, also guest feel privileged so u deal with drama a lot of complaints, most management doesn’t have your back when it comes to wrong guest, poor team effort every one is for themselves due to management being not on one accord"
good,very fast paced place kinda have to have experince to be able to handle working there. management was very low and would recodmend working there to anyone.people were very friendly.
good,you work all the time 6 days a week no breaks no lunch work six days a week to maybe get 40 hours and thats it hard to plan a life around just sundays off
good,Come and check the refrigerator see what's all need to be prepped up for today Prep it up stored in refrigerator clean out the refrigerator put away all Meats and produce sweep out the walk in clean up my area take the trash out and have the managers come check everything that I had to do the food that I prepped and food I put away clean meat ribs
good,Working here was a pain in the but.The management team was un fair. You dont get the hours you need and there is no balance between home and work. I wouldn't recommend anyone working there
good,I enjoy working here Because we are team orientated and have fun most of the time. It is a great place to meet great people and make some money in the process.
good,"Chili’s was a very good job , my only concern was the pay . It wasn’t enough to make ends meet on a bad day when i wasn’t really able to get tips. Working there you have to be ready to move at a really fast paste."
good,"Great job for transient students & young people who have a lot of flexibility. Difficult to transition out of some positions, little room for increased opportunity."
good,Boring job. They made you clean and clean servers tables when servers decided to be lazy. Servers complain and yell at you 24/7 if you double seat them even if it’s slow... managers are nice but this place isn’t very professional they all act like a family and take their jobs as a joke
good,Typical day isn’t too busy.  Learned customer service and time management skills.  Some managers gave preference to newer servers preventing others from more desirable shifts.  Friendly culture with the hardest part being that some got preference over others.  Most enjoyable part was getting through busy shifts quickly and with good tips!
good,"Not the greatest company I worked for at least the branch I was at, co-workers were catty as well as management. No communication between anybody really. Stressful."
good,"Be prepared to have a lot thrown on you, and then refusal of a raise when you're handling more than one person's job. It might start off easy, and you may welcome more responsibilities, but they won't pay based on those responsibilities. I did manager-level work for $12 an hour and was used as a reference to the managers but was refused a raise when I was handed extra responsibilities and was outperforming others on significant scales."
good,You will make great money if you're willing to put in the work. The managers are very nice. That's about all the positive things I can say. The environment is very toxic. The shifts are terrible. Awful about advancement. High stress job.
good,"this isnt a job you could even begin to live off. there is no chance to grow or expand within the company although they scream at the rooftops that you can, 9/10 dirty diapers"
good,"good place to work to pay the bills, stressful environment and a lot of favoritism. its not all bad, but after awhile it wares on you. very understaffed."
good,its so much stressful.its fun at first but it will so frustrating after a while the pay is not bad but sometimes you get 12 hours a day and sometimes you get 3 hours which is not good
good,"I am the last of the opening team.Started out as a great company to work for, benefits for employees. Now no benefits and no raises. Turn around in store has gotten really bad."
good,"Great money and great efforts for team building. Unfortunately, very inconsistent, would pay servers $3 average per hour to do 3-4 jobs so they could save money."
good,"It’s probably the worst restaurant I have worked in. The other servers don’t help each other out like a team. Most of the managers are okay, and they are flexible with hours. However favoritism is very big here."
good,The company is struggling for traffic.  They tend to care of their own in H.O. while not truly listing to those of us in the field.  Bonuses are set in a away that does not create loyalty with the brand.  Its about driving margins up as much as possible without paying out.  In 2018 bonus payout at the time was less then 35% for G.M's company wide (750+ locations!!)
good,"Workplace culture included everyone working well together to make sure a shift ran smoothly. Several different managers, each with their pros and cons."
good,The company is not the same as it was before.  The upper management is horrible and is gender racist.  Before it was the best place to work.  But now not so much.
good,"You can obviously see cooperate doesn’t care about their staff, They over work you, 5 mins breaks, changing of schedules without notice, short of cooks at all times. Amazing co workers and amazing managers when I was there."
good,Come in for a four hour shift  to either seat guests or come in and clear tables. I have learned customer service skills Management at least lets you do the job your hired for
good,The type of people who come to eat at Chili’s don’t like to tip. Made it hard to take care of my bills so I had to get a different job. That’s all I have to say.
good,"I really enjoyed most of the staff at chili's, it was a friendly environment, but one manger was too serious. She made someone go home just for not following server rotation. The same manager will talk about other employees behind their backs."
good,"They don't give you ANY breaks but bathroom breaks and you would likely work from 4 pm until 2 or 3 am. If you were planning on balancing your normal life with your work life good luck, because it's almost impossible."
good,"Need new management training"
good,"my typical day at work these were all my duties I had to do in a normal day"
good,"During my time here , the week days were rarely busy but on the weekends that's usually were most of my hours came from. For younger people I would recommend the night shifts"
good,At the location I was at is was very slow and the people that came in didn’t tip very well. We would have a few pops a week where you made some money but over all very slow
good,"Unfortunately, management tends to blame employees for issues that arise, taking no responsibility themselves. You have to work hard, with a skeleton crew, but make money that way. It's just stressful to get it."
good,I would to say just try to apply and you will find out. You will enjoy daily life with the other employees but the others will not especially those employees not do their jobs.
good,"Most days at work went fairly normal, the main problem with Chili's was the lack of attention to detail on part of the management. Schedules were sent out late and direct deposit for myself was never set up to the right account. An evaluation at 3 months never occurred for my pay and although I asked multiple times."
good,I loved working at Chilis but I got stuck in my role with no room for advancement. I would have stayed with the company if a better opportunity hadn't presented itself.
good,Was awesome back then. Company struggled and everything changed for the worse. Do not care to retain quality employees. Non existent Area Directors. Give to much away.
good,Need better managers had 3 GMs in the 8 months I have been there. One manager shows favouritism with employees. We can not keep servers and the good ones are not appreciated.
good,"Was a busy night behind the bar. Printer going off. Bar stools are filled and I'm alone. Handling myself so so. Until I needed change. Track down the manager in the back smoking just for him to tell me ""not my problem""."
good,If you ever worked at like BBW or TGI then this would pretty much the same thing. The place where i worked was worse though because it was a small Chilis and the management was terrible. The managers played favorites and they would only move up in the job.
good,Being a college student working a serving job was fast but stressful money. Here again while I was employed we went through many many managers. It was a high pace work environment but through all of the stress I did make life long friends there.
good,Great general manager and managing staff. They are very supportive of their team and have a great foundation of teamwork. Staff and management are supportive of one another
good,"The flexible schedule and tips were perfect for working my way through school, but customers are more dreadful than not, most of the employees are young and immature, and the company just cares about making more money."
good,I don't suggest working here if you're trying to provide for yourself and a family. I honestly don't suggest working here at all unless you're in college and looking for a place that gives you half off food and drinks.
good,"The atmosphere was hectic. While working for this company they were going through some management changes so they could fix some problems. This caused a couple of issues between management and employees and for the staffing turn over to be high. "
good,"The people I worked with were great, however, every shift was extremely stressful. lack of management didn't help and the kitchen staff was always behind."
good,I love my job because of my coworkers we are all close and enjoy working together and that makes our night at work less stressful and positive. I’m a peoples person and i try to always have a great positive attitude to make people feel welcome
good,"I work 6 days every week with 1 off and a 9 to 10 hours of duty, being a trainer is a big responsibilities because you are the one who handle your team and a leader in the restaurant. In a management team i handle also the office work like the inventory everyday and every day orders and our income in our restaurant. the hardest pat of my job is customer complaint because we as a server we give our best to our customer to make them satisfied to our service and food but some of the customer even though we give them a 100% they will find a complaint depends on their mood, so as a trainer I'm the one who handle the guest complaint and make sure that next time it will not happen again. lastly our most enjoyable part of my job is working as one team and even though we experiencing toxic or a tired of work me and my colleagues think that always think positive and enjoy what we are doing."
good,"The job was fairly easily.  However, I found that the the restaurant was poorly ran.  The seats and floors were filthy.  Often there was rat feces sitting on the window sills and seats on the booths that I had to clean almost everyday when I came in into work in  the morning."
good,"es un buen trabajo temporal, si estudias o buscas un mejor trabajo o puesto."
good,I worked here for 3 years and for the most part really enjoyed it. It's a great location and besides the normal restaurant drama all my coworkers rocked! The management however is the worst I have ever seen. They are EXTREMELY unprofessional and rude. None of them care about their employees and definitely play favorites. It's hard to succeed at a job where managers are against you. Would never recommend working at this location
good,Chilis was another part time job in college. Employees were somewhat nice but most of all cut-throat and threatening.. I didn't enjoy working here and took a job I thought I'd like more.. OPPORTUNITIES!!
good,managers where okay but the work environment was terrible. People would not show up for work and several cooks would hit on waitresses and where disrespectful. it was easy to move up if you worked hard and put your head down.
good,Chili's is a good place to work if you have Are flexible.  The managers struggle keeping employees there.  It is great for part time work but full time there leaves little time for family.
good,You get what you would expect out of a restaurant position. Working in the kitchen can be extremely stressful and often understaffed. Was given plenty of opportunity to learn more and advance.
good,"Chili's was a fun place to work until it came down to the managers being down your throat about survey scores and sales that then would affect how many shifts a week you got.  Very fast paced on the weekends, no room for advancement, never got a raise or treated any better with 8 years of service."
good,"Company changed over time, from believing in the core beliefs to focusing on matrix's and data to much.  Culture was great but it lacked when it came to results."
good,Good place to work but does not have a great call in procedure. Because I called in 2x I was cut back on a lot of my hours. Management was ok but could use some improvement.
good,Being a server is hard. Waiting on people who do not understand what this job entails. Being treated poorly on a day to day basis is exhausting and getting paid $2.13 and hour is definitely not worth it.
good,It was an interesting place for a fast casual dining experience that was great to learn at but the majority of the staff has been there for years which left very few opportunities for advancement or any changes in the schedule for people to pick up more hours or ever schedule off a shift and pick up another one to make up their hours for the week. As well as no sick or vacation days given to employees or any opportunities for higher pay
good,"I enjoyed working here until my hours started getting cut. Its a great first job but when you need something that pays well, chili's is not a great option. The management is nice and flexible with scheduling."
good,always something to do. meet a lot of different people that comes in the air port. learn about where the guest are from or actually going to visit or see this places
good,"I​ ​am​ ​a​ ​talented,​ ​diligent,​ ​charismatic​ ​and​ ​dedicated​ ​young​ ​go-getter​ ​who​ ​is​ ​determined​ ​to​ ​go​ ​above and​ ​beyond​ ​expectations​ ​in​ ​all​ ​aspects,​ ​responsibilities​ ​and​ ​situations​ ​in​ ​life.​ ​I​ ​am​ ​a​ ​quick​ ​learner,​ ​I work​ ​well​ ​with​ ​others​ ​and​ ​have​ ​plenty​ ​of​ ​experience​ ​working​ ​in​ ​retail​ ​and​ ​the​ ​food​ ​industry.​ ​These fields​ ​have​ ​provided​ ​me​ ​with​ ​the​ ​opportunity​ ​to​ ​develop​ ​my​ ​great​ ​people​ ​skills​ ​and​ ​as​ ​a​ ​part​ ​of​ ​a company, the managers were years younger than me and simply did not display everything that I just listed to be true about myself"
good,I worked at Chili's at two different locations.  Your experience there will totally depend on the management team at your location.  If you have real and understanding managers you will be fine and find success.  There are teams that have many individuals that are ridiculous and lack common sense.
good,"Chili's itself is a wonderful place to work, especially if you love restaurant work with low-glow attitude. However-as it is with any job no matter the location- the people you work with or under is a give-or-take scenario. Meaning, that some of the managers I worked under weren't too forgiving. However I had made a friend there and got along with everyone."
good,"I was unable to stay at chilis, after being promised a salaried management position, and never getting promoted after working for 5 months and going through all training necessary to become a manager."
good,If you are looking to make a lot of money this is not the place to do it.  Be prepared for low check averages and the management to comp half the check if anyone mentions the smallest thing is wrong.
good,"Your Chilis or ""Chilihead"" experience depends highly on your GM and your team of managers. Having said that this can be a good place to learn the ropes of the service industry if you're younger and inexperienced. If you're looking to pay your bills off of serving or bartending here its definitely possible but be ready to hustle. There's as much money here to be made as you can generate before your 40hr per week clock runs out.. Kitchen staff gets paid a varying scale based off experience and seniority."
good,"Lot's of running around, scrambling to get things done. The staff was a revolving door and most of the time seemed to not care. There were some that really did try to turn things around but those folks didn't seem to last long there."
good,"The management is always changing at this job, as well as corporate expectations. This can be frustrating, but the amount of cash flow is  so worth it."
good,"Hay mucha rotación de personal,eso hace que se cargue el trabajo a los server que se quedan, los gerentes no dan la cara a los invitados cuando hay quejas, falta de comunicación."
good,"I enjoyed the experiences I learned while In the food industry, but I found that I was a marriage to the job with little time left for a personal life."
good,"I worked here for almost a year. I left because it was difficult to have a steady income as a waitress here - the customer base fluctuates between decent and downright rude people. Also experiences the typical busy and slow times of the year - spring is very slow, summer is ok, fall/holidays pick up. Menu changes were difficult to keep up with sometimes. Very high turnover of employees (yes this is typical of server jobs) however how it was handled was frustrating. There would be periods of a couple weeks or more when there would not be enough employees for the restaurant to function properly without almost everyone working a double, especially on weekends. All staff were treated equally and fairly for the most part. Managers made sure communication and respect between servers and the kitchen was maintained."
good,Chili's is a very corporate ran restaurant. Constantly making servers jump through hoops and apply new rules or else you will get fired. Too many rules for a job mostly teenagers have.
good,"Chili's was a great place to work and I loved it very much. I learned a lot from my years on how to take care of people and build team members. I was able to work up through the ranks and go from a food server, to a corporate trainer, to manager, and then to a General Manager (Managing Partner) role."
good,Restaurante buen trato en lo laboral  y excelente equipo de teabajo
good,That company as name and standard its a huge but doesn't have grow up
good,Don't like the direction the company is heading. You make good money but it's stressful and can be crazy. You gets scheduled many hours and have many opportunities to make money. They do provide many opportunities to do things with coworkers and get a fun family environment
good,"Just like any restaurant, it had its busy and slow days. I believe"
good,"It was a long time ago.. But I remember it being a good first job. I did well as a hostess and also enjoyed helping my co workers when they were ""slammed."""
good,I love the staff but there were some aspects of working here that are unfair and not promising. The ziosk numbers depend heavily on your shifts and in the Summer the shifts are cut because there aren't any hours to work.
good,"To be blunt, any job in the service industry is just that. A job in the service industry. If a friend REALLY needed a job I would recommend applying here, but I wouldn't make it a career."
good,The Chili's that I worked at was not run very well in my opinion. Most employees did not enjoy working at the location that I was at.  I am thankful for the serving experience.
good,"The management is poor and advancement opportunities are scarce , but you can make a decent living from high volume of tables you receive. food is value priced."
good,"The title says it all, I loved working for Chili's but the management was just crazy. On stressful nights you could expect to be cussed out, even if you're doing your job well. That's just how the Chili's drama club was."
good,This specific store struggled with good management . You don't lose good employees to hard work but to bad managers . Was made to feel uncomfortable by one specific manager throughout entire employment while working until I couldn't handle it anymore spoke up and called corporate was coincidentally fired the next day.
good,Just a few minor things with the system needs to be touched on but definitely a fun and challenging place to work and love the people environment  I love the people and my staff
good,"As with most service industry jobs, Chili's involved long hours on your feet, tip wages, hot kitchens with plenty of yelling, and little opportunity for advancement. It got me through difficult times though and paid the bills so for that I am grateful."
good,I did not quit because of the people working their i quit because of the management team that ended up replacing the management team i had first started with. the new management team did not care about its employees. Coworkers were great to work with. They were your support during work.
good,"Unorganized, unhelpful, uninterested. That's how I would describe the management style at Chili's. Every day, no communication is given to the kitchen on business or what could be going on in the community that could affect business. Even if they're are three managers, two hostesses, and seven servers, which on average there is exactly that, no one thinks about the importance of being informed for the kitchen. Being uninformed is being unprepared, and when it gets busy, even the back of house manager does not check on the kitchen to see if things are running smoothly. Most of the time, all three managers might be checking tables, sitting in the office doing nothing, or watching TV by the bar. Pull-thaws are often left undone, and the prep crew often leaves without doing all the prep work, leaving the cooks on night shift, sometimes even day shift, to pick up after them. Management never keeps track of who's working what shifts and never runs breaks accordingly. More often than not, it's up to one of the cooks to figure that out for everyone else. No leadership is given or maintained in the back of house, and managers do not check if the jobs of some people are done correctly. No matter how many complaints the back of house has, management does nothing to change or help the situation, a very ""brush it under the rug"" style."
good,The job was great until the new manager came in & changed everything.  He made everything miserable for everyone.  People just walked out & never came back.
good,"I entered Chili's as a hostess and worked my way up to a server. I quickly realized that shifts are hard to come by. If you are not admired by the managers, you will not get the shifts that you desire.  Many people agree that being a server is a very stressful job and I agree."
good,"Chilli's was a great place to start.  The people were great and the managers were helpful.  But the pay is not enough, and I have been put on work every weekend since I started."
good,Great step in the door to begin talking to customers and learning to work through their problems to make a solution that makes them happy.Also great way to learn to work as a team with your co -workers.
good,It was nice place to work just lots of lazy people.. The managers were OK..all Ana all it was cool place but the pay maxes out at 15.00 an hr.. Your work always goes up but it pay stays the same
good,I spent less then a year here. Everyone was like a big family and everyone helped everyone out. Only issue was that they made me feel they were making me choose them before school.
good,I did not like not knowing when I was leaving. The management was terrible. You got no breaks. I enjoyed getting 50% off food. The people were friendly sometimes that I worked with
good,"I cleaned tables after the customer left, and after I got promoted to host, I greeted guests and took them to their table. It was an okay job, I just knew I wasn't meeting my full potential at that company."
good,Great culture but management was consistently changing and different rules were always being enforced. The menu was good and the drinks and specials brought in any guest.
good,"A typical day at work would include customers being thrown at your face every five to ten minutes, servers calling out with no replacements, servers not bussing their tables, and simple chit-chat with guests and co-workers. "
good,"No support staff. As a server you are expected to serve, bus, run food and anything else that management can come up with. Asking for help has resulted in management telling us that they will just hire better servers. Not recommended"
good,Working there taught me a lot with working with food and people good and bad .the management there was horrible but overall good place to start in a kitchen
good,"The majority of the staff and functionality of the restaurant were awesome. But some managers were not able to put drama aside and properly manage the establishment, therefore favoritism was present."
good,"Chili's is an excellent company to work for.  The food is amazing and the structure of the company is very solid.  Unfortunately,  the Chili's I worked at was in a bad market area. So for a server, that's not good because that means there's no money to be made."
good,"Workplace is fun for those who work there. But when it gets busy, there's usually a lot of frustration with servers and customers. Food may take long when a shift gets busy, but as long as everyone stays calm in the situation, things should be fine."
good,keeping a fast pace on the line having to be able to take servile orders at a time with in a certain time limit ...work in in the dish pit haveing to be able to keep dishes going and area clean
good,"Most staffed is over worked, and front of house staff is not paid like they should be. Managers are great, but everyone above them could care less about those who work under them."
good,"no organization, open door policy is not effective, managers are not professional, staff talk about each other to other employees, work 7-11 days straight"
good,"Very poor training, and the management doesnt even know what exactly they're doing. Some workers are really nice and helpful, but some just use you to do their work and it makes you fall behind"
good,Looking forward to work with a challenging company..new people and new managers as well.the prevous company had issues with salary increment after promotions are rendered..could not work any more
good,Chili's doesn't take care of their employees. Management started to slip towards the end of my career here. I did enjoy being able to interact with the customers
good,Pay was a hit or miss daily. Long hours. Management was average. They usually can work with your schedule of you're a server. Cooks generally are worked all day everyday.
good,"Very hectic fast paced job; however, coworkers were worked as a team to ensure customer satisfaction and to help as a team. Management team was great except for the GM during that time who was extremely disrespectful to employees. Hardest part of the job were customers who expected you to give them all of your attention and disregard your other customers. The most enjoyable was the environment which always seemed to keep you smiling and when you are stressed someone would make your night better in one way or another."
good,"Scheduling,Ordering,Inventory on a daily basis with maintaing a clean and organized enviroment with a quality schedule based off of predicted sales and budgets. Management above me was contacted over and over again to help with hiring processes and other issues and was never given the help requested. Hardest part of the job was juggling work and my personal life. The most enjoyable part was watching the training and personalble employees I was trying to create become a reality. Also making relationships with guest to keep them coming back for a great experience."
good,"its an okay serving job, nt you do a lot of work for little pay. theres always something wrong or inconvinent but I guess who cares as long as you make your money. per shift 80-140"
good,"Being a chili's bartender has taught me many things, from making drinks and ensuring food is cooked and plated properly.  To teaching me how to communicate and connect with people of all walks of life.  From cutting fruit in the morning to moping the floors at night Chili's taught me the benefit of a hard days work, while keeping a smile on my face."
good,"Chili's is actually a pretty good company to work for, they portray themselves as the best job in the industry, even though it's a pretty good company, far from being the best job in the industry. Don't think upper management have a realistic idea of what goes on in the restaurant due to lack of time with entire staff and isn't consistent in dealing with adversity. Be ready for long hours and stressful times with little support."
good,"I review brinker as an ok place to work, just don't expect any pay raises...management left something to be desired, especially the way that the restaurant was run. but other than that, the environment was pleasant enough..."
good,"A typical working place, Answering calls and online orders."
good,"Didn't get enough hours and often i would only work the minimum three hours that are legally required. other then then the people were nice but it didn't pay me enough to stay,"
good,A typical day at work would be managing a handful of tables at a time. Making sure every table is well taken care of is important. I learn new tips on handling the public every time I work. The management is very helpful; wanting everyone to succeed. The hardest part of the job is the grueling 11-12 hour days. The most enjoyable part of the job is the environment.
good,Management is very hands on and efficient. There are fair. The staff members are quick on their feet and clean. The kitchen staff are quick and precise. The guest can be hasty and rude or patient and generous.
good,"Long Hours, Constantly changing initiatives.  Changing Menu.  Inspiring team members was wonderful.  Training not as complete as it could be.  While interactions with the guests could be wonderful, it was open to a lot of abusive behavior and entitled customers."
good,Chilis is a great place to work. Some of the employees need new attitudes and the pay is not very great. I enjoy my job but I do way more than $8.00 an hour covers
good,"Normal day at work is preparing the dinning room to optimal conditions for the lunch/dinner service. Keeping floors clean, bathrooms inviting, providing support for the BoH (Back of the House). All in all, being in sight and also invisible."
good,Lots of change to keep the brand exciting.  Food and drinks are always changing to stay on top of industry.  Lots of great team members.
good,the co workers were awesome and fun to be around but the management were not friendly and made going to work not enjoyable or even worth my time anymore.
good,The pay was completely dependent on the cutomer ranging from well above minimum wage to well below it depending on the day. The company provided almost no benifits for its employees. The managers were nice but aloof.
good,Cool place to work at. Managers were nice and productive. I never had any problems with any guest or workers. The hardest part of my job was memorizing table numbers and sections. Everything else was common sense.
good,"A typical day consist of setting up work station and preparing entrees for customers.  I've learned proper food handling procedures, as well as, the importance to following specs. The management team can be capable of leadership, and co-workers lack compassion. Hardest part of my job is dealing with bad work ethics.  Most enjoyable is being missed on your day off."
good,"I worked in all aspects of the restaurant. I worked as a food server and dealt with the public face-to-face. As a greeter/hostess, I made sure that the customer received a good welcome at the front door. I answered phone calls and directed them to the their appropriate areas of the store. I worked as a to-go specialist and prepared the customers orders the way they ordered them in a timely manner. I also worked in the kitchen as a food preparer, making sure that the customer received their food the way they ordered it. As a trainer, I trained new employees, teaching them everything I had learned from my trainers and co-workers."
good,"●	Provided exceptional customer service to new and returning consumers."
good,Certainly not challenging enough. Wanted to Serve but was stuck hostessing and packaging to-go. Also did not agree with some management decisions that were made involving scheduling
good,"Chilis is growing and working towards great things. As a manager you have zero personal life and work very hard for minimal pay. The day to day is challenging depending on the team members. Managers cook, bartend, wait tables and more, very guest driven and wish to give the best customer service you can. Hardest part of the job is time management and most enjoyable part of the job is guest interaction."
good,"I liked working there, but the restaurant business wasn't for me."
good,"Fun workplace.we work as a one team, helping each other specially on busy time..I learned communication and motivation to everyone,the management they are working to and the co-workers are good.the hardest part of the job during busy time with luck of man power but the most enjoyable during peak hours with the team work."
good,"Since I am a contract worker, you don't want to be late because you are paid every minute. Whatever your station for the day you need to set it up and ready for the rush hour. I've learned to do multi-tasking and quick thinking in terms of food preparation and the food modifications when a certain order came up on my monitor. The management is very helpful in some ways but there is limitations to it. I guess because we are temporary foreign worker. My co-workers are hard working team. The hardest part of the job is when you are so thirsty during rush hour and nobody will offer you water unless you ask for one. The most enjoyable part of the job is when we tease each other and laughing about some jokes shared by my co-worker."
good,I was a server at chilis for almost a year my day to day activities were going from table to table making sure the guest were good and everything came out in a orderly manner. this job taught me to be patients with people and how to talk to different walks of life without losing my cool and treating them with respect. management was flawed in many different ways but they made sure that the guest were happy. hardest part of the job would have been dealing with the people when the kitchen would produce food in a timely manner. most enjoyable part was all of my co workers
good,"llegas saludas a los compañeros, y revisas el área de cocina donde te tocara laborar, checas la hoja de producción del día, tu área de servicio tiene que estar lista a una hora en especifico para poder dar el servicio a tiempo, los compañeros con los que labore mantenían un ambiente sano y divertido trabajando en equipo y apoyándote en el servicio igual que el gerente en turno."
good,"High turn over rate as it was a place were college students could find easy employment through. As a result, staff was inconsistent as was management."
good,good company but they benefits could be better. the managment was nice but they need to not be our friends but more of our boss;s
good,"I typically open and run the whole restaurant while management sits in the office.  I handle all problems with TMs and guests as well as organize, order, inventory and do all HOH functions.  I've learned how to coach TMs better, how to handle errors, and guest in a management role.  I get along with 98% of my coworkers most of the time, mainly because I work and am willing to help out. The hardest part of my job is getting paid hourly when I do the managers job all the time.  I enjoy the most about my job is helping others out, whether its in the community, charity or just helping my fellow TMs out during a shift"
good,Too many hours and not enough family time. I was in a store that lost both GM's I was under for poor performance. Kind of hard to learn when the GM gets replaced every 18 months
good,"come in and start slinigng drinks...Fun atmosphere, very fast pace."
good,"Being a server in general is by far one of the most challenging jobs anyone can have. But once you learn it it can teach a person so much. Learning to multitask is a great characteristic for anyone own. The hardest part about the job was learning to deal with stressful customers which every server will encounter at least once or twice. On a typical day you encounter many different challenges but with experience your learn to breeze through them. The most enjoyable parts about my job were my coworkers, those customers that understand your job and its complexity, and a smile from your customers who were satisfied with your service. My managers were very supportive of us and they were there when we needed them. Overall i will never forget my experience working at Chilis."
good,I enjoy working and the people I work with. The food I'd also good.
good,"My overall review would be 2.5 (*) stars."
good,I learned how to handle as much as possible with little help or assistance.
good,Good environment to develop skills. Management team creates a great environment to work.
good,Tex-mex environment. Sort of a hang out spot. The food is great and the people are awesome.
good,"work hard, long hours, this location has poor tippers, unless you have regulars that come to see you."
good,"i worked open and closing shifts, waited tables and had the busy sections.  i loved meeting new people and i also had alot of regulars."
good,Learned how to cook dishes I only saw on television. Rush hour was the hardest.
good,Serving tables can be challenging and rewarding. I made great money as a server but it was never a secure job. Serving has always been a great way for me to make money while going to school.
good,Overall work at Chili's is good. Teamwork is a struggle with co-workers and managers which made it difficult to be excited for work. Managers tended to play favorites and not give equal opportunity for advancements to people who deserved them.
good,"A typical day at Chillis is fast paced which i think is due to it being inside DFW airport. Working there i learned how to prepare meals from the menu, and also how the kitchen was ran and  by different stations. My co workers were very easy going hard working people just like myself and thats what made the job easy to do! The hardest part of the job would most likely be that long walk through from parking area to airport sercurity. My most enjoyable part of the job is receiving my paycheck after working ALL of that overtime! ;)"
good,"The job was fun, but we were in a new area and didn't have many customers so it was slow. Met some good people and had a great experience."
good,"typical day at work is just staying busy. meeting the guests needs. Ive worked for the company for five years now so i know everything there is to know. management could be better but they do okay. they never order enough product so when Sunday comes we run out of everything. love my co-workers we all get along and help each other out as a team. the hardest part of the job is not getting a tip when you worked really hard for it. you cant let the small things get to you. the most enjoyable part is making the guest as happy as i can , and of course the money when its there."
good,"I open the store,prepare food to serve to the public.Clean and put away equipment.All my co workers are very friend and good team players."
good,"As a server this job is not easy. A typical day was pretty busy. Taking orders, managing the table and guests, order correct food, quickness, cleanliness of restaraunt, treating guests like family. This job taught me how to multi-task. I am very good at this, because sometimes I would be in charge of ten-eleven tables with no help. Or having huge parties by yourself, was also teaching me how to be quick and proffient in making sure I did everything correctly. The management was very weak, and allowed a lot of sexual harrassment to happen. That was the only thing that made me dislike the managment. There were many co-workers that were very professional, however mainly the back of the kitchen I would experience sexual harrassment. The hardest part of the job was getting stiffed on a tip and having to let that go throughout your shift. The msot enjoyable part was having guests that were so friendly and made me love serving them."
good,"Chilis is a high paced environment, but management has favorites and hard to get quality shifts."
good,Didn't make enough money for the bartending and training I did. It was a new store and is now busy but at open I was training alot and woring days and it was no money.
good,pero la gerencia y supervisores no mantiene un muy buen ambiente de trabajo
good,"My day included arriving and getting station (table) assignments, checking that those tables were stocked with condiments and clean, greeting people at the door and seating them within 1 minute, and having drinks on their table within 5 minutes. Proceed to take food orders, offering info and suggesting upsells, entering orders on touch screen, preparing trays, running food, pre-bussing tables, collecting payment and providing change. End of shift involved stocking condiments and anything else in the kitchen that needed it, cashing out sales and reporting leftover tips, tipping out the bartender and food runner leader, checking schedule. Co-workers were generally helpful and fun in the workplace. The hardest part was not being able to please all the customers all the time. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing I was good at my job, and taking pride in it."
good,management makes empty promises and you will work twice as hard for half the money
good,"After working for them for over 2 years now, I have had a iffy exp there. I enjoy most of the people I work with and some of the managers are also good to be around, but there are the typical problems inside of a restaurant that you will find there such as: advancement takes forever, pay only rises when the managers feel like your going to quit if you don't get a raise."
good,Teamwork and handling guest making them feel like home. Welcoming back guests. Most enjoyable part of the job is the guests.
good,I like working there because of the people but the corporation or management is very unorganized and very dictating. Lack of team work sometimes. But what makes it all better is my new general manger actually works and helps everyone and dosent just sit in the office all day on her phone or gossiping in the front with the waitresses she actually a hardworker
good,Co-workers were inappropriate and crude. Management seemed to look the other way as ling as the job was getting done . Was not effective in keeping business up to standards or meeting qualifications.
good,Coming into a shift looking forward to seeing my team members smiling faces and pumping them up to get ready for there shift. The hardest task was get team to realize they have the power to handle hard guest experences.
good,"Working with Chili's, I always looked forward to working with my team members. Pumping them up for their shift. I enjoyed taking care of all my guest."
good,typical service industry job. fast paced and hard working job. must be able to multi task.
good,"Great menu great team members, friendly environment. Management will train you. Hardest part of the job is keeping up with corporates constant changes."
good,While the overall culture of the company has good intentions and guidelines the ball is fumbled at ground level management.
good,"If you’re looking to pay your bills and rent etc don’t take the job unless you are already trained for bar. In the cda branch, it is extremely slow most of the time. The only people who make enough money to support themselves are the bar tenders. Management was great for the most part except for one manager who doesn’t deserve to work there. Cda branch is still pretty unorganized and most of the time slow."
good,"Its a very busy environment, I learned how to work hard and to become a better cook there . I handled food accurately, store foods in accurate food temperature, prepared all foods to customers satisfaction ."
good,A typical day at work would be arriving and learning your section and then having customers in which you take their drink and food order. After this you place their order in the system and make sure their time there is pleasant. You also will clean your tables and interact with different people. Some days can be more stressful than others but other days will be very slow.
good,"I have worked all of my adult years at Chili's and strive to be my best always. No matter how hard I work as a line cook in the back, the company always seems to give pay cuts to the entirety of the back of house while saying that its what's best for us. I've worked at Chili's for four years almost helping out at other locations in need, and being employed at three separate locations."
good,"This was a fun place to work. Most io the time, the employees that I managed were wonderful. However the GM not so much. The environment was very unorganized as well."
good,"Managers are great. Willing to work with you on any issues you may have.  "
good,"Every month new things are added to the menu and every quarter the menus change completely. Management rarely forwards information. When the Chili's I worked at closed, I was told 2 days in advance, better yet the next day I showed up to work, the store was empty. No call or anything. Maybe it's just poor local management but I cannot recommend."
good,"Fun, fast paced restaurant to work in with good food discounts and lots of opportunities to meet many people.If you enjoy serving people and talking to them I would highly recommend working here, if your people skills are on the lower side and you are looking to gain better people knowledge working here is a great way to start."
good,Working here was decent but your coworkers don’t support you well enough. the management was very supportive and willing to work with you. The hardest part of working was the busy times got overwhelming
good,"Like no place else, foods are good, big serving, the desserts are so yummy, a lot of discounts if you have cupons, the staffs are friendly, accomodating"
good,"I do not remember much from my time at Chili's but I recall having great co-workers who always taught and helped me do my best in each position I worked. Although the pay, hours, and management were rather unsatisfying."
good,"I was a waitress for this company for 3 years and for the most part it was fine. It's a mid-level chain that services to mostly families but you get a little bit everybody. "
good,Over its an okay place to work. The management could definitely be better they don’t have a strong management team there at all. An the employees aren’t always the best.
good,"I worked all 3 stations, but usually station 3, which includes preparing all salads, quesedillas, baked chicken for entire line, ran conveyor oven, steam table and all dinner combos. I also ran the grill and tortilla press and bun toaster and fryers. The hardest part of the job was doing combos during rush hour. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing all of the happy guests enjoying dishes that I prepared."
good,"My particular chilis was good because i had wonderful coworkers. however the business itself is ran pretty sloppily because the corporation cares about all the wrong things. Shifts dont always run smoothly, actually they hardly ever do and as a server you are expected to do almost everything in the restaurant for $2.13. Its also frustrating that they do not have gratuity, so many times you have a large party (up to 30) and you can make maybe $5 off of the whole table, kindve a waste of your whole shift. i wouldnt recommend working here if you cant handle an extremely stressful environment or get discouraged easily."
good,"It used to be a great, fun atmosphere, now you must do half of an others work, while he gets paid full. No one seems to care about the fact we feed HUMANS."
good,Definitely worked there during a stressful time where they were extremely understaffed in the kitchen which led to me leaving. I loved the people I worked with but not having enough people to work the line most the time caused me to quickly dislike coming to work. I can handle fast paced kitchen environments but that was definitely a hard place.
good,"The managers were kind of demeaning and quite frankly most of them were just there to tell people what to do and didn't contribute much to the restaurant. I didn't mind working there, starting as a host and eventually moving to a food runner in a few months, but after about 5 months of working I had still not become a server which I had stated was my intention from the day I first interviewed with the GM. Even after being recognized as employee of the month, working hard and bussing my a**, keeping head down everyday I was not promoted. The process of moving up the ranks is broken in this company because it's designed to work for those who were there before you not those who work harder and deserve better paying positions."
good,"There is no initiative by managers to grow in the company professionally. It only has a selective group and you can notice favoritism. It is not that all Chili's are like this. But, most of time it is."
good,hardest part was learning all the recipes to the meals  and serving them right and making sure everything was in order and not messing up anything to make the manager mad
good,"A typical day at work includes but is not limited to: working within a section of the restaurant, maintaining needs of guests in your section within a timely manner, rolling 75 silverware with each shift, end-of-shift chores, and carrying multiple items at once. Working at Chili's it is very easy to get overwhelmed especially with a big party or needy guests, but stay focused and you'll leave your shift with a helpful wad of cash from tips."
good,the lowest pay I have ever gotten.  Work long shifts one week hours cut the next week.  Rude and cheap guest.  Food is not top quality.  some employees do what they want
good,I worked for the company for 4 years it was stressful sometimes but also had good days... it’s a social place you will probably get close to co workers but choose locations wisely
good,"You can ask for less hrs, more time off, or even a break and it never happens, days can be stressful, some of the managers do not do anything to help. I only stay for the guest."
good,Chili’s is a place that a lot of college kids work to try and make money. Management wasn’t good at all except for a few. Menu is always changing so don’t get use to one menu.
good,Chili's is a flexible place to work. My biggest issue was the turnover. I was a trainer but didn't want to continue training as new hires only lasted a couple weeks.
good,A place where I started my days in the kitchen. where I develop skills that would eventually helped to achieve my goals in the food and service industry
good,"Working at chili's, you had to be quick and on your feet! "
good,I've always been a cook and loved cooking so it wasn't very hard for me to learn how to do my job well. The hardest part is that it's always busy. I would have to say the management is the best I've had in a while.
good,"It would be stressful and fast-paced, but you get use to it. when it is slow you take time to prep or stock up. I would sometimes make jokes or random commentary to keep a dialogue to help people through the non-stop full screens on the weekend."
good,I was a minor working there for two years and never received a raise and was only promoted when I had to ask to do something else because I felt I grew out of the other position
good,At my location the management was absolutely terrible while I was there. Business was very slow all the time so as a server there wasn’t much money to be made.
good,"Over all, this was a great place. Everyone helps one another and is super friendly. At the end of the day it's like a small family in the restaurant world."
good,"Chili's is a team service oriented restaurant that tries to turn tables as fast as possible while still creating a special guest experience. They ask ALOT of their servers/bartenders, however the pay is worth it if you actually work hard."
good,The overall job was easy. None of the stuff servers or hosts are required to do are hard. The only downside are the menu process sleep going down causing tips to decrease. Also unless your in school or have kids the managers won't give you off the days you request and they will make you work doubles practically everyday.
good,"I was stuck as a To Go Specialist the whole time I worked at Chili's, when during my interview I was told that I would become a server within 1 to 2 months of my hiring. Meanwhile, they would hire other people as servers only because they had server experience, but they lacked the Chili's experience that I had in this job."
good,"A good job if you need extra money in your pocket on weekends. Not worth a full-time position, but having a good staff of servers alongside you is helpful."
good,A good company with strong people tools to help managers execute the company vision. Bonus structure is is largely dependent on how fortunate you are regarding placement within the area. Management is capable but inwardly focused. The company does not value work life balance appropriately and will push salaried team members as far as it can. Compensation is good to above average within the market but they get their money's worth out of you. Upward mobility is limited and not developed unless pushed for aggressively. The day to day is enjoyable and a great job. I love the people. I love my team members. A strong GM is a must to have anything close to work/life balance.
good,"Great food, good place to work, great team work. "
good,Chilis as a NAF job is a lot different than chili's in the united states. Management was very poor and there were less benefits also cost of living was poor. $10 an hour was not enough to support someone on the German economy.
good,"Great place to learn how to serve. Low priced menu, ghetto guests give low tips, because they have no etiquette. Sales doesn't get very high on very busy nights, so you end up busting your butt for $100."
good,Great place to learn basic skills for restaurant and customer service. Flexible schedule. Good Hours. Easy place to work at. I need more characters to finish this review
good,Bossy managers and ran out f food items constantly. they sent us across the street to the gas station for ice cream because they ran out. often out of multiple item at once
good,"My co workers were amazing, but above store leadership made it difficult. It was a struggle to staff management and the managers that were there worked ridiculous hours."
good,"It is fun, but i like working in the kitchen, management is garbage and if you expect to get trainned youre wrong. Its hot all the time and if you work zone 1 (fry side) you will constantly be getting screwed while the expo is yelling at you and constantly asking for things. If you can handle high stress settings its a good place to work and they pay good."
good,My restaurant was ran well enough it just wasn't for me. Too low of a price point to make a good living. management was adequate and they cared enough to hire competent people.
good,Good job just not enough hours. work is pretty basic and laid back. The crew is outgoing and thrive for greatness. would be the perfect job for me if I got more hours.
good,"My last GM was a total ding dong. I worked for the company for a long time and it all went down hill after a certain GM started at out restaurant. Chilis is HUGE on politics and not actual production, if your a YES man, you'll do great there."
good,"Ok steady flow through out the day.Get to interact with students,facuilty and staff.Prepare and maintain different work task on a timely manner.Great food"
good,Used to be a good and fun environment. Now just quotas and the phrase “it better be better”. Really? Not very motivating. Line cooks get worked to death and high turnover. Server and bar can make a fortune
good,"The tips are always unpredictable for the week, so the pay is not steady. The job environment is casual, friendly, yet fast paced. Team work is a huge part of this job so communication skills are key."
good,"I liked working here. Quick cash. Good managers. Easy job for someone going through schooling, or just an extra sode job (which is what I used it for)"
good,"A typical work day was usually busy, especially during lunch and on the weekends. I learned how to react quickly in stressful situations, such as going on a wait and finding tables to seat people at. The management was good when it came to communication and organization. The culture of the workplace revolved around drama. The hardest part of the job was going on a wait and seating guests in the right sections. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting a variety of people, such as guests."
good,Almost fast food style. Not exactly easy job to handle. Skeleton crew even on thed weekend. Consistent business. Definitely have to pay attention to your work because very easy to fall behind.
good,"Management is not amazing, there are a lot of problems that could easily be solved if they were addressed correctly. Everyone is friendly though and get along for the most part. It a great job to have temporarily, but the stress and  lack of responsibility gets old pretty fast. There are the people who have worked there for years and are used to the  disorganization (most of whom say on a daily basis that they need a new job) and then there are others who stay for less than 3 months because they cannot handle the scatter brained and unprofessional work environment. The job is very physically demanding but it is a fun environment to be in because it is so laid back."
good,Was working here in high school. It was a fun job with a lot of fun people but some of the coworkers weren't nice people. There would be yelling matches in front of customers. They would get in my face if I did something that they didn't like. Managers wouldn't do much when there was fighting going on either.
good,Like in any restaurant business you're apart of a family it was fun to work there of course and everything but it can really vary from location to location about management. The Gm I had I loved him. He was like a 2nd dad. It was a great time.
good,Fun place to work to.. passionate in operation and good management team..more opportunities from outside company.. an American uniform well known to all places
good,working together with the team mates even busy still we are having fun while on duty .hardest part its have a guest complain.good ambiance you learn new knowledge
good,"productive and fun place to work. I do like enjoy working with co workers, always looking for something to get busy, The most enjoyable part of the job is when customers leave happy !!!"
good,"-Management lacked care for team member and how they felt about certain things. "
good,"It's your basic corporate restaurant, not on the high side of  the pay scale, simple work though. Consists of 4 stations fry, salad, grill and desert."
good,"I started work at this place in 1997 and fell in love with the atmosphere, characters, and overall sense of belonging.  Thus I stayed and morphed along with the company for well over a decade.  I am NOT sorry to say that when I left that the company was already taking unneeded shortcuts and risks that could/would lead to it's sad state of present."
good,It was a typical serving job. I learned how to communicate with strangers and began to enjoy that aspect of the job the most. Management at the time was horrendous.
good,working environment was great but the hours weren't. I didn't think I was working enough hours to make up for the money spent to commute to and back from work.
good,I learned a lot about the restaurant industry including the work and stress level included in everyday tasks.  A typical day consist of constant cleaning and ensuring that customers leave satisfied and willing to come back.
good,Chili's culture is horrible and will never evolve from their 80's decor or mentality. I have never gotten so sick in my life so fast from working at another restaurant.
good,A good part-time starting job but not viable for a long term career due to the lack of growth in the company.
good,Not enough hours and BOH would mess up our itr's due to long ticket times and incorrect food  making customers mad at. The servers thus when it came to serveys we would get rated lower even if it wasn't the servers fault and. And ITRs are what they used to determine how many hours you get
good,"As management, hours were long. Extremely high turnover for management, made it difficult to maintain consistency for the company's standards. Although staff was excellent most of the time, it was incredibly hard to retain a general manager at this location. Always felt as if I was keeping my head above water when it came to meeting company standards when there was minimal manager support."
good,depending on the day of the week it could be very slow a lacking of tasks to do but on weekend it is very busy and crazy and and stressful with having way to many tasks at once.
good,Was a great experience. Menu changes to often and customers continually complained about menu items being taken away. Made great money. Team service was definitely an issue
good,Money is good. some horrible managers and some awesome ones. The horrible one made it unbearable. I Would say some parts of job made it easiest serving job and others made it hardest. I havent quit yet so there must be some good things about it.
good,"It's a fast paced job, especially when it's busy, You have to be confident in yourself and thick skinned to work in a restaurant, overall. The co-workers are what makes it fun and upbeat when working in the food industry."
good,I loved being at chilis and so did my husband who was a cook in my restaurant. we stopped working there due to an altercation with the general manager at the time. He has then since quit as well.
good,Loved working the past 11 yrs. here but the place has went downhill over the year due to poor management and lack of employees. Some weeks you have to work 7 days a week just to get 40 hrs. Vacation days were just taken away with no notice.
good,"At Chili's a typical day at work for me wo7uld start in the afternoon. The first thing I would do is make sure the station I am working on is ready for dinner. After that I would try to help with other prep work if possible. when the dinner starts i would typically stay on line until it is time to get ready to leave. When arriving near that time i would make sure my station is cleaned and i have done what is expected of me to do before leaving. After finishing this I would make sure it is alright for me to go and that it's not going to get busy and return home."
good,"Managers ignore problems and sit in the office."
good,My reason for leaving chilies was because my hours were not consistent so I needed a set schedule due to me having 2 jobs.So I needed something better..
good,"It's a difficult position without much compensation. The company has a bit of a problem with training, for i hardly received any, and it almost burned me from my position."
good,"My coworkers were incredible people. Very friendly and easy to get along with. I made new friends very quickly working in the kitchen. Management is strict, but if you do your job right, it is a great place to work."
good,"Okay job for college students, pay is decent for cooks, servers and bartenders make good money especially in college towns. Management is relatively good with minor complaint"
good,"Some days you could be there for a long shift and good pay, but some days you could be sent home after only an hour on shift. It can be a great place to work, but at the amount of hours you can make a week it is not worth it."
good,"Typical day depends on your position, and I did just about everything.  Waiting tables, rolling silverware, side work, training new employees."
good,Chili's will work you til you drop. They do not care about you or your family. The only thing that matters is the bottom dollar that the company is making.
good,"When it was busy, the kitchen and bar got bogged down. But usually would strive for good customer service. Management was mediocre and Chili's really tried to create a positive work environment."
good,The weekends were busier than the weekdays. I learned that I had to think on my feet. Management could improved a bit. The hardest part of the job was to keep the customers satisfied with their experience.
good,"My years with brinker, I surpassed much of the management I trained. I was given managerial tasks, with intents of promotion. As a line cook in one of my regions highest grossing location, I cooperatively completed my tasks as well as upper managements.  I never thought the job was hard, or stressful in anyway. Management never promoted me, due to managers themselves careers with the company being discontinued."
good,"Lack of advancement many people in line for gm positions many people have long tenure with company d.o. has his people in line for promotion,longwork days"
good,Shortened my hours each week would only have 1-2 days of each week or every other week and the way they processed money was wrong if the minimum wage is $7.25 how was i making $3 under and not getting many hours
good,Chili's is a great place to work but only if the pay was better and we get paid vacations and sometimes things can be organized and a balance of unorganized but that's work but it is a fun place the people there have great energy then you meet great people while you working
good,working at chilis was a fun learning experience i actually would not mind working at chilis again depending on who your working with determines how your day will go
good,"When hired, the manger stated that I would work weekends and called-in if needed.  Shortly after starting, my weekend hours were cut. Little to no training on job.  I learned my job from my co-workers."
good,stay focused always had a good time at work with my co workers never missed a shift always stayed on my feet never complained always did team work and never looked back
good,A typical day at chili's is very stressful due to how busy it can get as well as how much of the blame is put on the back of the house. I have learn how to manage my time effectively and handle criticism well which are both transferable skills from working here. The hardest part of the job is how fast you have to work while the most enjoyable part is the people you get to work beside.
good,"Management is unorganized, always running out of things, your performance is based on customer survey's in which servers also take blame for kitchen and management errors. Flexibility is convenient but when shifts are needed you have to meet a survey percentage to get that shift. They go by a system to make servers work harder for the same pay."
good,"Chili's was my first job. I started when I was 17 and stayed for 4 years. It felt like home and we all felt like family. Managers would change locations often, but due to company sporting events, we were still able to see our favorite managers often."
good,"I took a job as a server at Chili's because I needed a job fast. For that purpose it was a great job. I got the hours I wanted and made friends, but the compensation was not great and the management seemed quick to shirk responsibility, not a good thing."
good,"Face paced work environment...poor management. They take advantage of the hard workers and do not provide compensation."
good,"I enjoyed my time working for chili's but it was almost impossible to advance in this work place, they also expected you to work just short of death, and the hours were not reliable."
good,"Flexible with schedule"
good,"As a host, the biggest problem you face is scheduling. My experience was that you were given a starting shift time and then as the manager monitors customers flow you get sent home at the managers discretion making your shift anywhere from 1 to 5 hours long. The job itself is incredibly easy and you can make friends with the servers by helping get drinks ordered and clearing tables after customers leave. It's a good summer job for spending money, but I wouldn't recommend it for anyone trying to build a stable life foundation."
good,I did love working. I was the for a few years. Unfortunately as the years went on the business dwindled down  quite a bit. As much as I loved working there it was hard to maintain for life. I did stay till the end tho. Unfortunately they had to shut their doors. I moved on to where I currently am as a manager. But I made a great family there.
good,Good company to work for if you're lucky enough to be in a store that actually cares. Not only about their employees but the customers too. Management is what it boils down to.
good,Chilis was a really nice experience because I was always meeting new people. But this job showed me how trying to be helpful can hurt you in the long run. Some of the managers were extremely nice and help as were the other employees.
good,Its a good place for a college student if you need flexible scheduling. This job is for anyone that is looking for a fast paced environment thar is willing to give you hours.
good,"Working at Chili's was your typical restaurant job. I was a Host, and often times shared shifts with two to four other hosts. It was either extremely slow, or extremely busy. I came home smelling like tortilla chips and fajita steam."
good,"One is expected to cook, serve, or make sure everything is working smoothly in the back of house depending on position.  Can be stressful at times, but with the right team members and managers, the job can also be an enjoyable and rewarding at times."
good,the company is corporate so they don't see the servers as people.  they just see them as servers.  the management is lazy and does not manage according to volume of store.  the food quality is poor and I question their hygiene.  good job for a young person who doesn't know any better or just really needs the cash
good,"it's like we were an entire family. Everybody knew each other's weaknesses and we helped each other out. The management helped out a lot. The manager's at the chili's I worked at were amazing. They were so understanding and helpful and just all around great people. It was just a fantastic atmosphere to work in. I think it's pretty important to like the place you work at. The hardest part of the job was learning the food and handling the grumpy customers. Trust me when I say you can tell when a table is going to be unpleasant. The good thing about it is that you always had help if they gave you a hard time. Also, you got to remember they have to leave eventually. That was the hardest part of the job. The customer service part is the hardest part. Just always look happy and you'll do great with the customers."
good,"Honestly, the best part for me was to be able to serve others even when it is sometimes not easy. Management was okay, they have their bad days and their good days. We are servers to not only serve others but to make a living. With that being said, here, tips can be well under 20% even if the guests say they had a great experience and would come back again. I had a great table who said they appreciated my service and gave great feedback but would sometimes get a 10% tip on a $150 check."
good,"A normal workday at ,Chili's, is trying to say the least. With multiple large to-go orders, along with a packed house will push the limits of most. In turn, I learned how to keep a cool head in a hectic environment. I believe as far as management went, more could have been done for the employees. Regardless, I worked well with my teammates, back of house, or, front of house. The greatest difficulty was covering, what seemed like an endless amount of shifts.The best part was the satisfaction and pride i gained from the work and food i served."
good,"-	Greets guests, escorts them to their table, pull seat out for the ladies, and present menus."
good,"- My day usually starts off by getting there early to get some station fixed and cleaned."
good,Not a bad company just based on your area and management staff. Can make good money if you know what you are doing. Menu changes happen about 4 times a year.
good,A typical day at work is usually busy. Typical work like preparation and cooking is easy for me. I have learned how to get along with colleagues with different nationalities and how each is different from everyone else.Management is considerate enough to listen to the staff.
good,This is a good job to be at part time but there is very little room for advancement. There is money to be made if you are willing to work but i found they don't really hire the cream of the crop so you end up doing twice your share of the work because others slack or just don't care. There was also the problem of a lot of people calling out and having to fill in or ending up there all night. Over all it is a good job for if you are in undergrad and need some extra cash but I wouldn't recommend it for anyone over the age of 22.
good,"OK job, with ok people , not the greatest job but ok, had multiple positions but still couldn't get a raise when promised ."
good,"I recommend not to work at this location. Management is understanding for school, but hours are not preferable. If you want to be exhausted, and start to look like a zombie then this is a great job prospect for you. Otherwise, find a new location."
good,"Management was good. Great team environment. Corporate guidelines/policies sometimes overshadowed using common sense."
good,I have really enjoyed my time at Chilis. I love my co-workers. I would like to advance into a management program and I do not see that happening at this location.
good,"Bad management. Fun and challenging work environment. Good pay. Long hours with no breaks or lunch. Bad work schedule overall unless u enjoy working every weekend, holdiay, and nights."
good,The hours are very manageable . The hardest part of working at this location was some of the people but over this  company is a really good company to work for and it could really open doors for some one interested in management positions at that restaurant as well as others.
good,"The hardest part of serving was definitely not letting the bad customers get to you, along with working as hard as you could just to make enough money for that night. Whether it be, staying later or taking tables on the opposite side of the restaurant. There was a lot of side work included in serving, in the kitchen and on the floor, $2.83 an hour plus tips wasn't worth all the work we did. The best part was being able to work with such a great crew, I loved being a part of the Chili's family."
good,"if you live at home or with a room mate, this is a good job; however, if you are on your own this job will not meet you even half way as the pay is not so good and the hours are not available as well."
good,chilis was a fun place to work an learn new things meet new people management was not always great all the employees got along an always help each other an became friends
good,"Go into work, serve, clean, leave. Management comes in two forms leaders and micromanagers. Chilis exhibits both. The workers tend to do their jobs to the standards we are required to hold which makes the environment more pleasing. The most difficult part of the job is being a closer and getting completely slammed when everybody else (including the host) gets cut. At Chili's there are survey requirements that determine our hours and sections each night. If survey scores are low you are not going to make as much money. Those with the high scores are expected to be able to handle the hectic rush once everybody else is cut. Because of this I recommend servers applying to have some experience that allows them to be totally confident in being able to handle a hectic rush."
good,"i started off hostess, then waitress. Taking orders and engaging in customer service on a daily was quite fun and challenging at times. All seasons around, it was a fun place to work with coworkers and friends."
good,"My favorite place to eat, became a perfect opportunity to foster what I learned in school and prepare me for my eventual ownership of my own restaurant."
good,i enjoy what i do. serving is my craft. i take great pride in my work and i love working with guests. it makes me feel good to know the customer left happy and will return again just because i treated them right. this feeling is truly what i live for
good,"I liked the job. It was fast cash that went straight into your pocket. Management is very cool, and understanding. With this job apparently it doesn't matter how well your sales are if the guests rate you less then a 4 you lose hours and ultimately lose your job. Which I think is absurd considering that its a chain restaurant focusing on cheap ""fresh"" food. It might not even have been your fault maybe it was an issue with a host, bartender, other server, cleanliness of the restaurant, or even the kitchen could've messed up(happens all the time). When they get busy they don't just get swamped, it becomes a big mess. The cooks don't care about the food and are always cursing in Spanish. You can't simply call out if you are sick YOU NEED TO GET YOUR SHIFT COVERED. Gratuity isn't added on the check. In most cases tables won't tip accordingly. the other Servers are all different and unique and no one is scared to be them selves. The most enjoyable part of the job were tables leaving happy and full."
good,"I enjoyed greeting guests at the front door by offering a personable approach. The job coordinated well with my school schedule, and was a decent job for being in high school."
good,my first job that taught me all about customer service! loved all the employees that i worked with! management was alright
good,"When I was hired on as a waitress, my duties were as one would think. I greeted tables, took drink, food, and dessert orders. I sat people at tables, I cleaned tables, swept floors, and washed the booth seats. We dealt with all the money transactions ourselves as well as prepared gift cards if someone wanted to buy. I worked mostly evening shifts but also worked some days. Our management was horrible while I was there, there was a lot of favoritism and unfair treatment between some of the managers and the employees. I was a waitress trainer for some time, I don't even recall having been trained or asked to be a mentor, yet was scheduled to do so. There were a lot of clashing with the servers some nights, the best part of every day was simply the end of the shift. When we brought a lot of in house issues to some of the higher ups, through whatever reason, they were changed locations or let go."
good,"Pay is great for the job you do, gets better with improved  performance.  The crew you work with is like a family and even after a hard days work everyone is still friends.  Hard to advance depending on your direct supervisor, it is not based on results but on who brown noses the most and this is evident in most cases.  Long hours and but not hard, if you have a family it will turn into a stressful situation, unless you are used to long hours."
good,"It was fast, easy money when I needed it. Chili's was a necessary stepping stone to the next phase of my life. The hours were ideal for me & the ability to pick up shifts to accommodate my bills was a plus."
good,I would spend my mornings getting the kitchen line ready for open by stocking various foods. I would then help in the back preparing other foods that had to be prepared ahead of time.
good,"Decent place to work. Good pay but not great, always busy due to sports events. Workers tend to not last as well making the job harder"
good,"While there is always something to do at Chili's, whether it be cleaning bathrooms or rolling silverware, the constant drama from the servers weighs down on you. After a month I had had enough of it. The management is great, but they were only willing to have certain people advance; in the month I had been there, I had two newer coworkers advance above me."
good,All employes and cooks got along and the place usualy had a upbeat feel to it thanks to the servers but management wasn't so flexible nor professional.
good,"Environment was always fun. always had exciting contests for all associates to participate in. St. Jude was the best time of the year, I was always the champ."
good,"A typical day at work for the people who actually worked hard and did their part (which is surprisingly a low number) would be to come in early for your shift to ensure you were set up for success, and then work the lunch/dinner rushes you were scheduled for strait through, no to minimal breaks. In many long years of working there, I did learn some invaluable things such as customer service experience, financial transaction experience, food handling laws and regulations, and most importantly, how to be a strong, capable member of a large ""team"". Management are generally very easy going, nice people who work pretty hard to please the guests, however this easy going attitude made them lack when it came to reprimanding those who did less than their fair share and those who out-right didn't do their jobs at all. Which, for anyone who is a hard worker, is extremely frustrating. Co-workers weren't all bad, but the vast majority were allowed to get away with laziness and incompetence on a daily basis, which can be difficult to deal with on a daily basis. The hardest part of the job would've been the sometimes long hours on your feet with no breaks, and the stress that stems from a constantly fast-paced environment, with little help from your supposed ""team"". The most enjoyable part would have to be the people who you became close to and who became a family. Pretty much 99% of the people I now know have come from chili's at one point or another."
good,fue una buena experiencia aperndi cosas nuevas y tambien conoci personas interesantes
good,"typical day includes chaos and screaming."
good,"The work, although fast paced and - at times- strenuous, was easy. I learned that a smile can go a long way in the food service industry. My management, was below average but my relationship with my coworkers made up for the lack of leadership. The hardest part of the job was to maintain my bearing after dealing with an irate or complicated customer. The best part of the job is the ability to get to talk to people of every background and get to learn something or someone new every day. The regulars make things easy as well."
good,"Usher customers to their tables."
good,"A typical day there was always stressful. As a hostess after clocking in I would stand at the door and greet guest as they came in and would seat them to their comfort. Wipe tables and chairs down, spot sweep as needed, clean restroom, and help servers when needed."
good,"What can I say about Chili's? I worked in several restaurants and they all have their minor differences, but it's all basically the same. You won't have many opportunities to advance, but the culture working as a server was a lot of fun. I enjoyed the co-worker's and Chili's took care of it's employees as well as anyone else in the industry."
good,Enjoyable company for culture.  Innovative company at the forefront of the industry.
good,"There is no work ethic in this place. There is only a couple girls that work there that are nice. One girl falls asleep at her tables and rolls her eyes at her guests when they are not listening. That would not make me feel good, I had the slave postion there, You buff/roll the silverware for the waitresses, you clean the bathrooms, the outside trash, sweep throughout, clean the windows, and on top of that the select girls come up and complain about everything. It was not an enjoyable place to work at at all. I also would have to drive 20 minutes to and from for 1 hour of silverware rolling 5 times a week, what a waste."
good,"Advertised, marketed, and recommeded menu items to guests. Ensured the satifaction of items and maintained the guidelines of the Chili's brand."
good,"Enjoyed the customer focus. Always able to get a grasp of how a customers experience was. Very high paced, management was willing to help when needed. Hours were very flexible."
good,"Cash handling experience"
good,Chilis is a good place to work. Was very flexible with my school hours. Being a cook at chilis can be very overwhelming.
good,"Worked at two locations one in 4S Ranch the other in Yorba Linda. "
good,Handling food and cash. Making sure orders were correct and to customers satisfaction
good,just basic restaurant work. we work hard but also have fun while doing it. most days are busy.
good,"Training team leader for three years and part-time key manager for one year.  Assisted in formatting and implementing a brand new training basis for all new employees and training teams which is still enforced at this restaurant today.  Helped with employee meetings, promotional events, organizing creative incentives and marketing monthly featured items.  I was the highest paid server at this particular branch due to my top sales in featured items on a weekly and monthly basis, the large clientele base of returning guests I built for the business through the years, my positive and constructive leadership skills performed with the training of each new employee and the loyalty and dedication to the company for four years.  I not only gained leadership skills at this first job, but also the primary skills required as a sales person.  I became well rounded in relating and interacting with a variety of types of people and even more experienced in learning to find key sales points for each individual I encountered quickly and effectively.  Gained experience in working in a fast paced environment and how to handle stressful situations with negative or unhappy customers"
good,On a typical day at work you could experience what a highly stressed job is. There was no time to laid back because of all the responsibilities. I learned to maintain a constant communication with my coworkers and superiors. The managers were always on the look out for mistakes or misconduct. My coworkers were capable an experienced on the labor area. On my opinion the hardest part of the job was taking the trash out but all the hard work was balance with the sympathy of the coworkers.
good,Overall good co-workers but the management lacked direction
good,"Typical day consisted of maintaining transitions between tables, customer service, communication in the kitchen.  I learned customer service technique and selling-points, time management, troubleshooting customer conflicts if manager was not present.  Management was supportive and helpful at times.  Busy nights created stress in the kitchen and on the floor, causing management to go awry. Most nights it stabilized but lacked constant oversight.  The most difficult portion of the job was ticket times.  Management worked to gain control but customer service had already began sliding.  Most enjoyable portion of serving at Chili's was the co-workers.  We all supported each other."
good,"Overall, it's a very fun place to work where I get to interact with different people every single day. I love that part! "
good,"I loved the food, but I really disliked working for the company. My co workers all had negative attitudes. My managers played favorites and there was not much advancement  while I was there. I appreciate the job experience and life lessons, but worst job."
good,"Due to the high rate of management turn over, the store lacks structure and consistency."
good,Great experience to work for this company to continue my career
good,"just like most other restaurant jobs, bad hrs, decent take home cash, work late nights and weekends"
good,I worked at a freshly built Chili's so my job was to set up in the morning and get everything ready for the morning shift. Also to wait tables roll silverware and clean. Dew to my experience I was charged with helping to train the new employees. management was very hands on. And my co-workers where always willing to learn. The hardest part of this job for me i think was having to deal with somethings that I'm allergic to. But it was always good to do my best.
good,"Cheap clientele, 2 for $20 is abused, fun young staff takes your order with a smile,"
good,"The hours are long and the pay I was started at was poor for the work I did. The general manager's for the company in this area have it made though so if you are GM or higher, great company."
good,"Working at Chili's is fun at times. Typical day might be steady and we play music while we doing our work. But when it's busy, it can be a hassal. Managers are cool , so are the co-workers. When working at a restaurant like Chili's you have to expect the unexpected!"
good,"I work as a training cook .I learn more cooking ,management ok, co worker ok,cooking"
good,The best part of this job is the ability to be constantly coaching and teaching my staff on how to improve their jobs and raise awareness on controlling food costs.  Constantly increasing knowledge of food safety and sanitation practices.  Everyday is a new challenge to improve from the day before and to build sales.  I've learned different ways to manage people and to challenge myself on how to get more productivity out of my staff and still create a great environment in the workplace.
good,This was bartending.  Pretty easy You worked with customers to get your tips.  Mostly it was enjoyable but the downside was everyone works for themselves.  No team work.
good,It was overall a fun place to work. Although it was very hectic and the structure was not good. The priorities and expectations were there but not enforced. A lot of arguments happened between co-workers and were not solved effectively. It was like working with high school kids with a bunch of drama. There needed to be more maturity among the workers. The hardest part of the job was communicating our problems during peak times and communicating the problem clearly.
good,everyday was just typical ok co-workers and very poor management
good,"A typical day at work would involve me greeting and seating people in a specific rotation Chili's had for customers since some servers would come in later. The co-workers at Chili's were great to get to know in the work place; positive attitudes and a great sense of humor. Whenever there were big volumes of people at my job I enjoyed speaking on the loud speaker to grab their attention. Trying to keep rude customers from being ignorant of what's going on in the restaurant, I'd say that would be the hardest part at working at Chili's."
good,"The customers and some staff are amazing. Depending on the day, management can be very helpful and understanding. Expected to be either crazy or bored"
good,"A typical work day would be dish-washing and cooking. I learned how to do my job with quality and accurately while completing my tasks at a fast pace. Management was always cranky and stiff and would not allow a fun, and exciting work environment due to the complaints from customers about the servers. The co workers were great, but were always stressed out because the Management was stressed out and unleashing their anger on the other co-workers."
good,"Working as a to go server was not as promising as it seemed. It was an ok job however whenever business is slow, you were cut first. Tips were a bonus"
good,there really isnt a typical day working at chilis but in most hospitality jobs that is typically the case. Ive learned many things from my time at chilis ive learned to read a guests vibe. ive learned how to turn many bad situations into good or productive. The management has about the same turnover rate as the servers. Individually love everyone of my coworkers in their own ways. The most enjoyable part of working for chilis is the staff everyone is very supportive and understanding.
good,Usually a six to eight hour shift.
good,i enjoyed working in the restaurant environment greatly. Chilis was a great company to work for.
good,"Restaurant management, good with people development, run day to day operations...hire, develop team members"
good,Enjoyable place to work not much oppportunity for advancement
good,"Not a whole lot to say about this job- not well organized... in fact, the MOST unorganized (and one of the lowest paying) of all restaurants I've worked at. Management is constantly changing (at the location I worked in, anyway). The other servers, cooks, etc. there are GREAT though!"
good,"I liked working here. There were good and bad coworkers. Management was great and understanding. Customers were often very hard to deal with, and unfortunately management let that continue. I was paid alright but hours were short and I was scheduled very seldomly. I had 3 roles."
good,"A typical day is going in a serving tables, doing side work and working as a team with other team members. Every few months there are margarita contests which are fun and you get to play games and win prizes"
good,it was alright i didnt like it the manager sucked and the culture was terrible with everyone being miserable. managers use employees out of selfishness and laziness.
good,"I fell in love with the culture. Managing and meeting company expectations was a challenge, especially meeting labor expectations while providing an excellent guest experience. One of the hardest management jobs ever held."
good,"Working at Chili's let me meet new people, become close to the workers and seeing familiar faces. I was able to talk to the regulars and the management helped me with difficulties in the workplace with customers."
good,Very productive work environment with nice co workers. A lot of team work amongst staff. On very busy days things got done smoothly and efficiently. Somewhat potential to move up in company but not a lot..
good,Money is not bad but can be stressful.  It's a very fast paced and you definitely work hard. It is a corporate company which can have it's good and bad.
good,"The scedual is never consistent unless you've been there a very long time. Don't request too much time off, they don't like that. No paid vacation. No sick days."
good,"The management at most restaurants like this are uneducated in the topic of community building and mental health.  Management fails to communicate properly, and does not respect employees schedules outside of work."
good,when you are injured at work you shouldnt feel as though managment is upset at you for it or think you are lying about being injured. I immediately quit when this happened
good,I am a very hard worker very independent very trustworthy very respectful man and have been in restaurants business for 30years have a bless day don't have to much to say upon this job
good,"reinvented a classic! signature sizzling fajitas served with sliced bell peppers & caramelized onions, topped with chipotle-garlic butter & chopped , very nice to eatcilantro."
good,"Learned the line cook job."
good,"Not enough hours available.  I was available full time but did not get enough hours put on schedule and if I am put on the schedule, they often call me and tell me not to come, too many servers on floor."
good,I loved working here when I first started. Over the years they continue taking more of your money to compensate other employees wages. As of January the tip out percentage will now be 5.5% of total sales.
good,I enjoyed working at Chili's. I'm very glad I came with experience because I would have been very overwhelmed with the amount of orders coming in. My station was always very busy at night time (the shift I worked the most) and at times we were understaffed so you had to be able to work with a lot of pressure from the front of house.
good,"fast passed restraunt take care of guest...............................................make every guest happy.."
good,"I learn to sharpen my cooking skills. prepping certain dishes on the menu, working with different people with the same goal and love for making good food. Nothing better than group of people working a common goal"
good,"I love cooking, but this place was very unorganized and had sloppy workers. Two of the managers were amazing, and the other two were horrible and let people walk all over them. A very political environment and chose favorites."
good,"Chili's ok place to work good people good food."
good,"During my time at this location, it was as if every man for themselves. some support but only when someone else needed help. not much of a family or team"
good,Very unorganized job but loved working there! Coworkers are like family everyone trys they're best to work together. The management when i was working there were not very great with communication.
good,"PROS: Ambiente amigable. Se aprende a ser más organizado y saber como lidiar con el cliente. Propinas."
good,"It’s a job that pays me. And I don’t know what you guys want me to say but I guess it’s good working there. Yes, I wish I got better hours but it’s the restaurant business."
good,"What made the job hard for me was the Coworkers, chili’s is my first job and I wasn’t very good at getting to know my coworkers at that time but once I got more into the job I started to communicate with them more."
good,"It was a decent company to work for. A new manager came in who was not ready for the job. I couldn’t work someone like him. Very aggressive,2 months after I left he was fired."
good,I liked working here as a line cook. It was good for over a year and then the other cooks there started to have problems with me so I decided it was time for a new job.
good,"It paid the bills. The culture/ work environment of the business was reflective of the management which changed frequently. On the positive side, as a server/bartender, you always knew that you would be leaving work with cash in your pocket."
good,You would usually start the day with getting your station ready for service depending on what time you began work. Then you would start taking order/upselling from guests that have arrived to dine. This includes proper order taking from the customer. Timely food and drink  delivery with periodic checkups of the customer as needed. And finally payment acquisition from the customer followed by a thank you and an invite to return.
good,Working at chili’s is a start. Just stay focus on your work or you’ll get behind. I just need to find a busier location. Overall wise that’s a nice job
good,The best part about working at Chili's were the friends and other connections I've made. It's your typical corporate chain restaurant working experience. Management is excellent.
good,"I adored everyone I worked with, and I had an easy time getting coverage when needed. Although, the managers at chili’s were not much help when trying to understand scheduling and coverage."
good,The coworkers made it pretty stressful for me when I worked there. I went above and beyond. Cleaned their tables when it wasn’t even my job. All they did was complain about the customers and being double seated like they aren’t there for money to begin with.
good,Chillin was cool to work there but the wage and tips weren’t always that good sometimes we would be busy and there would be no money to be made because we got paid 2.50 an hr
good,"Upper management(corporate) was not very connected with it's employees at my store at my time of employment. The general feel was a ""Do as I say, not as I do, and without question""."
good,"I had a great job as a corporate trainer and my manager took it away because he needed me. Ridiculous....took away my corporate future and slandered me to his boss because I had a ""bad attitude"""
good,"i was really excited to work there at first, and then a couple months after i got used to it then the managers started being rude and the people would say nasty things about the costumers. not a good work environment"
good,"I loved working there but they didn’t want to pay me enough or they’ll pay new people more than me from the start when I’ve been there for years! Other than that, they people are nice and hard workers"
good,I'm been working so hard and everything was great but now I need more hour to work and it not enough low hour though.im been learning a lot about it Chili's restaurant
good,Overall working at Chili’s wasn’t that bad the management was 50-50 on being understanding or not and working upfront was pretty easy and pretty relaxed I liked being able to meet new people and being able to help out other people when they were too busy to get their job done all at once
good,"I got out of there because I wasn’t set up to succeed. It’s a fast paced environment and the people became too demanding for me to handle. Management didn’t step in to help with my struggles as a new employee. Instead I was punished. Given less hours, which lead to less income, forcing me to find another job. Which I have and am doing a lot better now."
good,"A typical day at work would usually be very fast, getting orders together and heeling out our guest as needed and when their food came out. The hardest part about the job was when our ticket times would go over because so many guests had just put in all their orders"
good,"Besides being hostess, I took an early shift to help clean and many times helped out at night with clean up if the dishwasher didn't show or quit.  It was a fun place to work. It was a sports bar, so many enthusiastic guests. The management and co-workers were all very nice.  They were very accommodating to employees work hours. I was ""employee of the month"" many times. We got to wear jeans and company t-shirts.  We got to interact with regular guests.  Hardest part was dealing with costumer problems who had to wait too long or dissatisfied with their food."
good,"As a server, you need to be able to serve multiple tables at once and memory comes in play here. Making sure your customers are happy and enjoying their meal. The ultimate goal is to get a good tip at the end of your service."
good,"Classic server job. If you enjoy talking to others, feeling busy so that your day goes by faster, and being around food this will be a good job for you."
good,"Good management, good food.   Had to prep food for upcoming lunch and dinner rushes.   Enjoyed working here but they couldn't give me more hours.   Decided to move in another direction when they let me go"
good,"I liked the job tremendously but I hated the GM I had.  I worked at Hurstbourne store under a guy who had worked at TGI Fridays.  He was an awful person and I was his assistant manager.  He was not good and mark did not see how he really was, which was a complete jerk.  I was not going to allow him to humiliate me and I watched him do it to other managers.  He was rude, put you down.and made you"
good,"Nice enough place to dine, would not recommend being on the kitchen staff. Poor managing combined with lazy coworkers made for a bad personal experience. Be expected to pick up slack left by others and deal with typical hectic restaurant environment."
good,felt as though management judged me for my age.  I am 45 and i had to fight to get the job.  I am proving myself now but it was difficult.  I am between jobs so had to get something immediately.
good,Management was a bit more harsh and less understanding than any other job but great work space and money. They did not discriminate and every one was welcome. The customers and business was great and always fast paced.
good,I worked many restaurants before chili’s is the worst place to work . They make you do a lot ..... of side work .( at least 2 hours ) and go home always after 1am at night.  Please stay away!!
good,"It you're a good server you'll do good there. Just like any serving job. When I worked there it was pretty chill. It got stressful at times but, pretty common for a serving job. Decent incentives."
good,They seemed to have a Low amount of managers. With my amount of fast casual experience i was spread  very thin! I worked alot of hours to make up for the difference
good,"Some managers were better than others. The hours kind of sucked, which means the could also suck. But the co-workers and environment were great. Pretty easy to cross train and ""move up""."
good,Most of the days at chili’s in kingman are chaotic and stressful and management doesn’t always provide the support you need. Shifts are based off of customer reviews so if you have a bad shift it can affect your scores tremendously and it can take two weeks of great shifts to balance it out. It’s a terrible system
good,Chili's will only pay hostesses minimum wage (7.25) when you are surrounded by a stressful environment full of people. Even on busy nights like friday and saturday the servers don't have to tip you out.
good,Chili’s challenged me to learn new things and developed new skills when working with the public. I was able to gain new experiences that will beneficial to helping me in the future.
good,"Its what you would expect washing dishes, but i also did some prep cooking which i enjoyed to do. The staff i worked with was awesome, great group of people."
good,"Chili's at the time for me, was my first and only job. I was still in highschool, it was very exciting for me. Chili's is a very fun and fast-paced place to work, the only issue I really had was the drama; there are so many females as servers, and sometimes it can be a bit much. The job personally for me wasn't hard, but for the other hostess' it was. The thing I enjoyed most was interacting with customers, making people laugh all the time and satisfying their needs."
good,"I would like to start off by saying the low review on the compensation/benefits is just because I was part time. I'm unsure how good/bad their benefits may or may not be. Chili's was wonderful in the manner that i loved my co-workers but one of the managers was over bearing (there were four in total at the chili's i worked at). He would come up and sit people and not tell me. Then the seating arrangement got messed up and we over sit the waiters. He also wouldn't let me put people on a wait even on Saturday nights when the place was filled to the brim full of parties that just came in at once. I think he's leaving soon though so that's good. "
good,It was ok to work for but they need better managing and better manager they server to slow bye picking up food. It need to get better on hours and pay..
good,it was laid back but also very fun because it was a team enviornment as well as an individual setting. I really enjoyed it but I could not continue because
good,"Was a decent company to work for.  Very fast paced job.  on the job training is given to new hires.  Benefits offered are decent enough, but you will be on your feet several hours each shift."
good,Chili's was a great place to work. We were a close knit group. It was always like going to work and hanging out with family. There is an issue with keeping HOH staffed because of over working
good,My experience at Chili's was good however some of my employees would  slack because of the amount of time they had worked in the job and  thought that it didn't matter. Also my managers would play favorites instead of who actually did the job they were supposed to do. Although it was not always negative I did find some co-workers to lean on and talk to.
good,They have a great program with St Judes and the menu is always changing to meet the newest trends managers are very approachable and willing to work with staff
good,the hardest part of the job when rush hour comes and you have to do everything alone. but still a good place to start if you want to gain experience in this field.
good,"Overall, it is a good job and a place to work. The managers at my location are very relaxed as long as you do your job and don't just stand around. My position(s) as a Host/To-Go starting pay is $10/hr and as To-Go that is before any tips come into play (I currently average between $15-20/Hr with Tips, but no Tips as a Host.)"
good,It will be slow until lunch time management was okay but i had move away very diverse me there was no hard part to the job if i was ther long enough  i can tell you more but i cant
good,"Choosing the location is key and so is management. The manager before the current one was so stressful and expected servers to do a million things at once. The new one is better but numbers are everything to them and determines if you keep your job. "
good,I like working there just serving period can be stressful. A typical day i bring home about 50 bucks on the weekend at least 100. You work in a section with a partner that suppose to help but that can be a good or bad thing depending on the staff and the type of employess there.
good,It was a good fit for me however I had some ideas I would have liked used maybe next time. It was great place good food I taught a lot of young people the ways I work it was satisfying.
good,"in a typical work day, you would come into work, put your coats and bags on a coat hanger and then grab a headset. Meet with the managers to talk about the day and if anything special was happening. Then you would clean the bathrooms, clean the windows on the doors and help the bus boys clean off the tables faster, then you would go home. It's a really easy job"
good,Dont make the mistake I did and not input the credit card tips. Job was fun. We got to help out St Judes with donations.  It was my first waiting gig and I didnt do so bad.
good,I've worked at Chilli's for about a year and a half now. I feel like there is no room for advancement. I still have not recieved a raise and work from 35-39 hours weekly. It is super fast paced and just not really a career im looking for.
good,"cool place to work, busy alot. 2 for 20 menu was a hassle. open too late. having to deal with customers wasn't the most fun. drink specials were good."
good,"A typical day at work is you get to work and clock in then start working, once customers start coming in you greet them with a smile and then you ask them where they prefer to sit and seat them. I learned how to have patience with everyone even when things get busy, I learned how to deal with a waiting time and taking reservations and I learned how to help servers with their tables and I learned how to take tables orders. The management and Chili's was pretty good some things needed organization but overall things got done that needed to be done. The hardest part of the job was only when it got super busy but everyone helped everyone so it wasn't as stressful. The most enjoyable part was seeing the customers that came back and getting to build relationships with your customers and your team members."
good,"• open the restaurant and be ready to the customers "
good,"Usually at work I would sit customers and greet them, and I learned the different zones of the restaurant and how to handle customers and keep them happy while eating there. A lot of the managers there are very nice people and help out when they can, the workplace culture was pretty good could have some problems at some points. This job didn't have many hard objectives and the most enjoyable part was meeting new people and make new friends."
good,"The Job is alright if you have never served before. But its not very busy, so the money can be awful at times. Particularly when VCU is not in session."
good,With the company is where I started. They gave me the tools and training to become a effective team leader. I made many great friends and relationships working here.
good,I will stand by the quality of the food here 100% if the food is prepared correctly. I loved it! The biggest issue is that it's rarely cooked correctly.
good,Good environment and friendly staff. If you need a very flexible schedule this is a good place to work. Also is compatible with a normal High School students hours.
good,fast paced work environment with great co workers and staff. always busy and tips were fairly good on the right nights. management was always poor but staff made the best of it.
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo, sueldo competitivo, oportunidad de crecimiento"
good,It was a fun place to work but still a serving job. Something I would tell other is to be prepared to move a lot. Also download hotschedules to manage your own shifts on your device.
good,difficult work environment.  exceedingly difficult goals to achieve.  rewarding at times. schedule/work life balance extremely difficult to achieve. work most weekends. many nights.
good,"Pretty decent place to work. I was in the kitchen, which got a bit crazy but not too bad. Management there at the time were not that easy but I'm not sure if they're still there."
good,Strong corporate structure.   Heirarchy definately exists and area directors come around and the gm's freak out on the assistants and the assistants freak out on the lead servers who freak out on the lesser servers who freak out on the hostess.
good,Chili's was a fun work environment. The workday flew by fast. Everyone was very helpful and friendly. I enjoyed working there and all the people I met.
good,Very fast-paced and always busy which meant no down time. Always had to be prepping and make sure everything was perfect. Very physically demanding and taught me a lot of good qualities
good,"Nothing honestly special about the job, its fast paced restaurant work that can get a little overwhelming on some nights and really slow on others. Typical stuff."
good,"I enjoyed working here except for working long hours."
good,Opportunites to make good tips depending in business. Not a good job if you're looking to support a family. Great job for high school or college student.
good,"Fun Fast Paced, Stressful At Times But the Money Was Good and Management Addresses and Takes Care of Any Problems Their Might Be to the Best of Their Abilities"
good,staff were not trained properly.  Other managers did not preform duties that they were assigned.  Staff had very low moral and were insubordinate.  There was no alignment.
good,"The problem with working for Chili's is that they dont practice what they preach, not all the time.  One, even in management, is constantly being second-guessed on what decisions are made, trust obviously doesn't matter, and the quality of life is greatly reduced by the long working hours, sporadic scheduling, late nights, and stresses of the job.  Bonuses are minimal.  The Team-Members run the show and its hard for any manager to compete in that environment."
good,"a typical work day consisted of ,greeting and seating customers in a timely and friendly manner. accurately taking orders making recommendations and delivering food"
good,"Working the back of house at Chili's is a stressful job. It is always busy, and sometimes you have to work two stations at once, which could be very stressful during a busy rush. The management team was very supportive and understanding for the most part, and your coworkers usually were very nice as well."
good,was a great place to earn money but management was poor. it was easy to see they played favorites over there. i had many health issues and they just stop working me after i got my shift covered one time.
good,"Pros"
good,Not the best place for long term employment. Good for college or high school students who are not relying on their wages to survive. Not the most flexible hours.
good,Never got a raise.  Corporate management not care about about the floor workers.  No incentives to stay.  Long term employees are pushed out the door.
good,A typical day at chili's could very. If it was busy you were getting your butt kicked if it was slow we all sat around the corner hanging out. Everybody is real friendly they don't hesitate to help you if u ask.
good,Chilis sucked the life out of me. I worked there for way to long. Should have left but the money was really good cause I was a good server. I will never go back to a Chilis though. Id rater serve at a little family owned place.
good,working there was a fun first job but not worth staying due to the fact that they were not flexible with my school schedule and i was not making enough to live on.
good,The managers were great but employees were not on same page.Also no career advancement.Pay was reasonable other than getting paid bi- weekly.Looking for advancement and career opportunities.
good,Chili's gave me the opportunity to see the management side of the hospitality industry and was a great stepping stone for me. Since Chili's I have been able to see two different styles of management and with what I learned in school have a better understanding of what I feel is my management style and what it takes to be successful.
good,As a server at chili's yor pay is determined by the flow and volume of customers. Seating is rotating and table size as well as the time it ia occupied determine your days pay.
good,"Not really much to talk about. Waitressing is what it is. This was a fun place to work and to meet people.Good job for younger groups, college students"
good,"It’s very stressful sometimes like any other job but it’s a good amount of money if you work at a busy chili’s, the workers are usually really nice too"
good,It was a fun place to work and nice people to work with. The management wasn’t the best when I worked there. They were also very flexible with my school schedule.
good,It is extremely competitive and fast paced. There is absolutely no team work and more experienced servers are not helpful to new servers.  Management was ok until they changed managers.
good,"I was a server so I took care if the guest by taking orders and making sure they had what they needed. The pay for server is  not fair at all, 2.13 is not fair"
good,"very fast paced work environment. helpful co workers and managers. high customer volume on weekends, enough hours and positions to move around the restaurant and learn new things."
good,followed food and health guidelines prepping food and cook at a fast paced and cook under pressure getting tickets or orders out one time and prepping
good,I felt the job was easy and if you were balance with being a good coworker and great socially then you can make it pretty far with the Guest but as for management at the location at my time were most new and had no experience or that’s what I felt then sooner later became poorly treated I pretty much stay doing the captain my captain until it was to toxic for my character.
good,not enough hours managers were very not involved. they didnt seem to care about servers needs like days off or family emergancy. They said if we call you in you come in or fired
good,"Not the best, fast paced and cut throat. They will keep telling you they will train to serve but never do and keep making excuses. They are okay pay wise but not for the work I do."
good,"Chilis is a typical, middle of the road chain that will provide you will a good base, but will leave you without a true, strong foundation to build from."
good,"typical process enough staff no complaints. "
good,"I like going there because I'm so motivated to do work at this time in my life, but it's time to get paid for what I'm worth cause I know Im better then that"
good,"Chilli's is a decent job for those in highschool; or recently out, looking for work. It gets hectic at times, but for the most part its a very chilled out job."
good,Relaxed atmosphere. Relaxed culture. Company strives for collaboration. Uniforms not too exciting. Not a whole lot of room to advance. But not a terrible place to work.
good,"Waiting tables is not for everyone. Especially at Chili's. That being said, if you work hard and have that spunk, you could do well here. The management team was new and hard to work for, but the environment was pleasant overall."
good,Good job for waiting tables in college or as temporary/part time work. The work environment is typical of any restaurant - fast-paced and can be stressful but worth it for the money made.
good,"working at Chili can be very over the top. i have no problem with fast paced and multi tasking but its just a bit much, when you have no hostess, no busboy, no food runner, no expo, and the bartender is nowhere to be found...just a bit much."
good,I came in . set the front and back of house up for the day. when done setting up for the day we would wait for our first table .we would great our table and go over the specials for the day.
good,you are expected to be a robot. can sustain an affordable style of living on income but not much room to grow and expand. fun work environment with co workers
good,I did not enjoy working at chilis for the most part. They are willing to hire anyone which creates and unsafe work environment. I would not recommend this job.
good,i loved working with my coworkers. It's the culture that made me happy. I would recommend this career to anyone looking to further their management skills.
good,"I had a lot of fun working for this company, if you like people and can handle food and beverage and all the highs and lows that come with the career its a great company to work for"
good,"If your looking to move up in the company, good luck. Be careful who you trust or confide in. The pay isn't worth all the stress, and it doesn't matter how long you work there. you will get the same pay when you started. Unorganized chaos and  Communication is a huge problem."
good,It was a very busy place to work. I learn a great deal about customer services and relations with our customs. I developed a firm and firm character. i developed strong friendship and meet a lot of wonderful people.
good,"I liked chili’s just the drive was too far and I didn’t get along with all the people I worked with or some of our bosses. I was a hard worker, always was there when I was scheduled."
good,If you are not a corporate server then this is not the place for you. plenty of opportunity to make money and advance if you know how to follow all the rules and smile when told to
good,the pay was better but the work was harder as a dish washer at chilis everything deepened on how fast you can get dishes out and the dishwasher is always one of the last people to leave
good,"I worked here for three years and the people I worked with were great. But lets be real, its a chain so how good can it actually get? Its very rule oriented and you must hit quotas and follow procedures to a T. Overall it wasn't a bad experience but I would recommend avoiding chain restaurants."
good,"This could be a good job for students, or for someone building there resume. People starting out in the job world would do well with this job. It helps build up experience and learn basic skills."
good,"I enjoyed working at Chili's when the restaurant was busy and I was making a decent amount of money. Unfortunately, the business was never steady so I did not always make enough money to get by. I did like the multitasking and fast paced environment, but I did not like when the management gave the best shifts to their favorite employees."
good,I waited tables. The job was fast paced and required me to multitask. It was not a very hard job and is something that anyone can do as long as you are able to prioritize.
good,Great company but not enough hours or the hours you need. great food. would love to work for them again but as a hostess.  love this company recommend for other people to work here. working as a server money is god but the food trays are really heavy and not enough people helping with food delivery. need to pay more to workers. its a non stop fast pace not even enough time to go to the restroom
good,The people that work there are good team players they will help you if you need something. Everyone helps with the side work and helps one another . Also almost everyone there is friendly
good,"taking food and drink orders, serving drinks and menu items, and carrying out customer requests, clearing tables and assisting in the kitchen, performed day to day supervision of non-management associates, assigning them the tasks for the day, directing the overall store level operation performance, managed inventory, and trained and developed shift leads."
good,it was alright. not busy at that location but the people were fun to work with. management have no clue what they are doing. the dont know how to used their people correctly
good,"Decent place to work, unfortunately not much communication from the top down. There is lots of movement within the brand which really hurts the overall flow of the operations."
good,My co workers were pleasant and the managers were nice some didn't understand that about my mental health issues and that is why i took a medical leave of absence and then resigned
good,It is as fast paced restaurant. The food is always good and the money is excellent. This being said you will have to be a fast person and be able to handle stressful situations.
good,"ok place to work"
good,When learning a new position they weren't very supportive. The managers retaliated against workers when they couldn't come into work by taking hours away. Hours were cut anyway.
good,"The patrons for the most part were fantastic, and very friendly. The management lacked in judgment. They allowed large issues to go unnoticed, but small things became bigger problems."
good,"I haven't worked at Chili's in several years. When I was there, it was a pretty good place. My boss and I had a good report and I was given a fair opportunity to learn my responsibilities and execute them."
good,Working at this chilis was unsuccessful because most of the customers were regulars or there wasnt much busy flow so it was hard to make tips. People often got sent home early.
good,"I learned that foods were assembled by specific cooks, prep cooks prepared the food before it even reaches the line, and line cooks actually make the food to order.  The whole kitchen has designated areas and functions."
good,I do not recommend the location I was working at because the managers either hid in the back office and didn't discuss problems with you or they made you feel as if you were nonexistent. The servers blamed everything on the hosts even if it was not the host's problem or something they had a hand in. The environment of the location I was at isn't a positive or productive environment.
good,"First location was great, management was fantastic, really enjoyed this one. Change in managing partner and it went down hill, tons of turnover, if you were liked, you were golden, if not - forget it, you were toast"
good,Decent place to work to start out as a waitress and learn the ropes. where i started for my first waitressing job. Management usually worked with you and understood things come up
good,"Trained employees thoroughly in customer service and hospitality. Environment was a family-like environment; everyone worked together, and employees and employers cared for each other"
good,"All the regular responsibilities cleaning, scripting, cleaning, side work, making sure your guest have a enjoyable experience with good food and atmosphere, and trying to build a personal clientele."
good,"Chili's was a perfectly adequate place to make money while searching for a career job. As a server you'd have your section of tables, back of the house work to keep up on, and running food for all tables when you were free. The people were generally friendly and management was pretty good about helping you with days off."
good,"My time at chili’s is very on and off, one day I could be having the time of my life the next all I want to do is quit. One thing for sure is that everyday is always filled with surprises"
good,"chilis was a great place to work for people that are just starting out. but I wouldn't want to stay for too long. IF you like to be on your feet all day and sometimes not get a break then, by all means, have fun."
good,"the management at chilis would listen to my concerns, but not help remedy any of my problems in a timely manner, if at all............................"
good,"A good day at Chili's would normally consist of loud talking, high pace movement, and heavy interaction among employees and guests. To me the people, employees, make and set the tone for the certain restaurant environment. Overall, its an easy job and work schedule flexibility is ok at times."
good,"I am rather neutral about this job. It was a good place to make a decent amount of money very quickly, however it was kind of stressful while I was in college."
good,Was a good place to work. Reason for leaving was to get away from restaurant life. Needed a more steady shift. Wasn't making enough in tips at this restaurant.
good,Chili's was a pretty cool place to work. I met some cool people who I'm still friends with after 10 years. The job is very fast paced and stress full but your co-works will help you and they try to make it a fun environment.
good,The particular location I worked at had an influx of different managers and servers who were often emotionally unstable and rude to hosts/other employees. The hosts were regularly insulted and/or scolded by random members of the wait staff.
good,Learned a lot about back of house. Gives me option to move around to different positions. Fast pace environment. Very busy and professional place to work.
good,"-Atención al cliente (mesera, anfitriona)"
good,"The managers rarely agree. They are rarely on the same page. They tend to choose favorites and that is who gets the most hours. You make decent tips, but depending on which sections the managers assign you to depends on how much money you make."
good,"Upon arrival I would set up the food line to prepare for the lunch rush. After the rush, I would take to-go orders while also managing the kitchen. Before leaving, I would need to stock everything to make sure that my staff members would be prepared for the evenings. I would also count the drawers to make sure that the reports were correct and then put a new drawer in for the evening shift."
good,I didnt mind this job. It was the job i had through High School and it payed. I would recommend the job to anyone! It was a fun learning expirience. its perfect for a first job!
good,Worked at every location in Hawaii.  Great training program.  There is opportunity to advance if you work hard at it.  MIT training is intense but very imfortative
good,"Get to work and start with all the dishes and other kitchen utensils that are stacked from time the restraint opens. Since there is no day shift for dishwashers you get to wash everything that piles up when you get to work. The hardest thing was the dinner rushes, there is constant plates needed to be washed."
good,Had a great time working for this restaurant. They are family oriented care not just about yours but the community.  They have great managers that are willing to go the extra mile for you
good,buen ambiente los compañeros son muy agradables y te aludan en tus dudas.
good,"Good environment, nice co workers . Good job if you are trying to gain some experience in the food industry. However more experienced servers should work in a more upscale industry."
good,It is a job that makes you money. You meet so many different people and make connects with them. It was a good job as a younger adult. It can be stressful but alot of fun.
good,"Salaried managers are worked well beyond their pay. Salary is based on a 50 hour work week, but I worked many more hours than that every week. Bonus structure was almost impossible to achieve,"
good,"very fast paced in little spurts. the hours vary depending on how long the rush lasts, could be 2 hours or 6 hours. the managers are great but they pick favorites."
good,"I have no review to post about my time at Chili's. It was a neighborhood restaurant that I bartended at for many years. There were things I liked, things I didn't, just like any job."
good,"I like working with this company, managers and employees has good relationship. We work as one team and with teamwork specially when the business dictates. I enjoy even we have a lot of guests and we need to move fast as much as we can, instead of being pressured, we just laugh about it."
good,Very busy restaurant very fast paced I enjoyed washing dishes there learned prep and coked on all four stations I became a good solid employee knowing the whole kitchen
good,This place was fun to work at and was a fast paced job. The customers were mostly friendly and management was really good about tending to everyone's needs.
good,"Through my many years of working at Chili's I have discovered a passion for customer service. Chili's has taught me how to work in a fast paced work environment filled with diligent workers. Overall, my experiences here have been positive."
good,"Had this job part time while studying in college. Don't have much to say about it. Had flexible hours to work with my school schedule, and got paid decently through tips. Wasn't looking for a career here, just needed some pocket money, and this place did the trick. Wasn't stressful enough to distract me from my school work, and paid enough so I could go out on the weekends."
good,"I enjoyed working at chilis, but the management was iffy. There were so many nights when they would run out of food, or be short a server or 2. Them lacking on certain things put a burden on the servers who had to deal with the guests more."
good,"Most days were great, others were not so hot. Staff was mostly good, except for the few bad eggs. Great for college or first job experience. Management was mostly accomidating"
good,"Extremely flexible, casual, tips were good, felt as if I was getting paid to exercise in the off-season, people were great, food was great, would wait tables again there in a heartbeat...though 30 years later."
good,Opened doors for customers as they come and go. Greeting customers. Busting tables and operating the front end of the restaurant and making sure things are being ran smoothly. Maintaining the front end of the restaurant.
good,"Great place to earn a living, but no time to live the life you've earned. Breaks are minimal, and productivity is the all important factor when assessing your ability to become successful as a Chilihead manager."
good,"didn't really have a great experience at this work environment, also most co-workers were rude, disrespectful. Also management was very unorganized and backwards."
good,Its the same as every other one like it. Usually staff mixed with veteran and rookies. poor direction for management leads to confusion and continual short handedness.
good,Chilis was my first job in food service. I enjoyed my time and was promoted well during my years with this company. the general manager at the time was amazing. i am sad he is no longer there .
good,"this was my first job as a hostess. it was a good experience having to talk to people, and what i did here is what you would do at any other restaurant."
good,Good except upper Management. The day at work was fun and exciting always something different happening and different challenges come up every day. Would recommend working there.
good,"Positive work place environment, management was good and understanding, fast-paced and busy, constantly on your feet and active for entirety of shift, must be able to customer friendly and personable"
good,I have been working under chili's for four years now. I have been under pepper dining and Brinker's as well. I am really not fond of the work. It isn't the cooks just not the greatest quality in food.
good,"Pay is awful, but the staff is amazing. Like any waitress job the pay is far below the minimum wage and the hours are unpredictable. Some days you can work a 3 hour shift some days you could work a 7 hour shift."
good,Quick paced. Okay management. Quick food prep. Okay hours. Some bad seating . Floods when rains heavy. No out times never know when leaving. Never know when closing or not
good,"It has been a long time since I worked for Chili's, however, it was a fun place to work at the time. Atmosphere was great, and co-workers were the best! I can not give an accurate review at this time about being an employee."
good,"worked as a waitress, not much different from serving at any corporate restaurant, memorized and adapted to menu changes, worked my way to cocktail serving, applied teamwork skills and worked hard at being an outstanding and reliable coworker"
good,As a host and as my first job in high school I thought it was a good job to get to help me make a little extra money during my high school years .....
good,Was a good job to have right out of high school. Got to learn the value of money and what it is like in the work force. Overall it was a decent job. Just nothing to make a living off of.
good,Although I think they can afford to pay way better the management was well established. The staff help make the day easy and tend to help you when you need it.
good,"I worked at Chili's for my first job. For being a first job, it was alright, because I made just enough money for gas. However, I will never work there again."
good,Very fast paced environment.  People friendly. the hardest part of the job was that u have to memorize what each plate looks like and place every food item on the plate exactly how it is shown in the picture once learning to do that job was relatively easy and very steady.
good,"I worked for Brinker who owns Chilis and On The Border. I enjoyed the flexibility and benefits. Also, the mission statements and core values where great providing the where lived out."
good,I recommend anyone who has a love for people to wait tables. You meet a wide variety of people and you earn pretty good money waiting tables. Majority of the staff at chili’s were fun and friendly. It was an environment built on teamwork and a great way to learn how to work together.
good,more drama than i thought some food came back everything is kind of a rush . i had to put the food together and check the food to make sure it was correct.
good,"Fine place to work. Good pay for the amount of experience required."
good,It was my first serving job and a long time ago. I am writing this review because it won't move forward with my resume until I do. I'm sure it's a great place to work .
good,"*full time"
good,"Its a place where you can try and try to fo your best but it will always go unrecognized. Get a degree and still no advancement, they just look at other factors that are not really measurable."
good,Didn't get paid enough for the amount of hours worked . Wasn't treated fair had to train a host and they got paid more than me. Very unfair job wouldn't recommend anyone working here.
good,this company was fun to work for but they lost all core values in business and food. i would recommend working with chilis but they will consume your ife
good,"During my time of employment and Chili's I was taught how to properly serve food, take orders, prepare bills and handle all diffenret types of customers."
good,It was a quick paced environment. Very focused on cost cutting that at times seemed to diminish the quality of the product and work against the core values.
good,"My review overall at chilis has desperately changed. I was there through major management changes ao I would say in the beginning things were great. I still loved my job and every one I worked with. As well as my guest i developed to see on a regular. After the management changes I will say this hours dropped. And alot changed so it was rime for  a change. The most enjoyable part is getting to learn the work paste,  and learning new foods we often have. For me personally it was my guest. I loved to connect with people. Hardest part for me was staying on the clock. They wouldn't hold many people in the clocking. So hours were competitive."
good,"Very busy location, there is always something to do. Team service was new while I was there and it was great, low staff so it meant more tables for the experienced servers. Good perks."
good,"Everyone loves chilis for happy hour. I just worked at the wrong chilis with the wrong people. Doesnt mean all chilis are awful, just this one at that time."
good,Management was actually kind of decent. Stuck by the rules most of the time. Had a lot of regulars to individual servers ratio. Very well sought out work environment and I enjoyed my time there.
good,"Had a great time work ing at chillin met alot of nice people learned alot about different types of foods and how to cook them. Learned how to maintain a good pace, learned how to work the fryers the stoves , warmers ,and flat tops."
good,"Responsible for operational promotion through various social media and direct marketing campaigns"
good,"Chili's is a high paced, competitive work environment. Very challenging environment due to certain aspects of management and staff relations. However, there is a laid back atmosphere."
good,"Working at Chili's was my second serving job. Technologically improved restaurant was beneficial. Competitiveness was among my peers, sometimes it would be slow and many other times it would be packed."
good,"At Chili’s, employees are expected to carry out plenty of different duties. Some of which include; making sure customers get what they ask for, Greeting guests and seating them, treating the customers with the best care possible with a smile, bussing and resetting tables, finishing our side work towards the end of the shift which may include sweeping the dining room, cleaning high chairs and windows, re-filling sugar and salt & pepper or cleaning up inside the kitchen."
good,"I enjoyed this job as well until the general manager was replaced with a new one. The current general manager is frustrating, and she doesn't listen to what the actual problems are."
good,"There is always something to do, from creating and seating guest to rolling silverware, sweeping floors whipping down tables or just cleaning menus, I use my time there productively."
good,I liked Chili's i found myself living in a environment that i felt okay in but then. I felt unsafe so i decided to leave.  There was a groove going on all the time everyone was always on their game and worked together to create a good place for the guests. I loved guests and talking to them but i also found myself being taken advantage of.
good,"chilis is a good place to work for a person who is starting out in the service industry, not very high advancement rate or opportunity. The chain restaurant is very slow but good working environment."
good,"Great place to work"
good,I know longer work at Chili's was a first time job. Environment was fun would recommend working here to any young teen looking for a first time job experience.
good,Some management is good while other management is biased. Don't feel like I make enough money to pay for bills to care for my family. Not many options to move up in the company.
good,Restaurants usually have good days and bad days but it seems this one in particular mostly consists of bad days. If you can handle the stress the pay is pretty decent.
good,"very quick paced learned more about food production ,management really didn't assist none workplace was ok people were ok ,hardest part of the job for me would be the rotation back and forth to different stations assisting and nobody covering your own."
good,fun face paced competitive environment. great for students or someone without a lot of bills because serving minimum wage is less than $3/hr. If you are a good server you will make it up in tips.
good,Chilis was a good place to work in highschool or while attending college. I cant see it being a long term employment source of a source of steady income.
good,"I loved working at Chilies,  i had the best co workers and everyone worked really hard to maintain a steady flow. I had the best training experience, they really prepared me for the job. I felt very comfortable   to perform the duties i was required to do."
good,Horrible workers who want others to do their jobs for them and curse at the management full of lazy rude servers need to learn proper team work and a Lil manners
good,Working for Chili's was a great learning experience and it allowed me to work independently. I would recommend that all people new in the workforce and want to work in the restaurant industry should apply at Chili's.
good,Loved the people that worked there but there is a very high turnover rate.The work itself was not hard just time consuming most of the time. There was good diversity in the workplace.
good,"Overall fun place to work if the staff was good. Upper management had there issues. If they didn't like you, then it was tough to get things done. Franchise ownership is very different from corporate."
good,"quick-paced, great team members, general manager is respectful and very nice, customers are great. I learned better communication skills and new foods on menu."
good,"Well i go in get the dishwasher ready and start working on dishes and other stuff my boss tell me to do. I learned how to clean really well and how to deal with a overwhelming scenario and not to get stressed out. The management was friendly but serious. I made a lot of friend at work that i still hang out today. The hardest thing to get over was as a dishwasher was the overwhelming piles of dishes. The most enjoyable part of my job was the people, they were so friendly and nice i wouldn't have gotten as far as i did without them."
good,A company that is a monopoly of chain restaurants with mediocre food and decent drinks. I like the egg rolls and my brother was an awesome GM in Hawaii.
good,"Working environment was standard for a chain restaurant, which varied based on the number of guests at a time. Well organized and clear job descriptions."
good,i have noting to say about chili's. i liked working there because it was challenging. it continues to be a place i visit for it ambiance. i am indifferent to the business.
good,"I met a lot of great people in the seven years I worked there.  Its a fun and fast paced environment, good food and good drinks.  They run lots of great contest for servers."
good,Its A Great Job But Poor Scheduling And Poor Management. They Would Schedule Me Every Weekend And Only For 5 Hours A Day.. The Management Would Only Focus On Important Things When Night Crew Came In And Right Before An Inspection.
good,"Typical day - Stocking condiments and trying to keep busy on slow days"
good,"Nice Place to work."
good,The culture was based on a heavy labor focus. These goals of customer satisfaction were no always achievable due to this focus on labor cuts. The customer base was being lost due to this.
good,"Not a bad place to start working for someone looking for a first job. Managers were nice. Peers were friendly, hardest part of the job was the heat from the steam washer and most enjoyable part was the paid days off."
good,"As a hostess it was a lot of work for minimum wage, found myself busing lots of tables on shifts. Schedule was mostly weekend nights. It was okay as a temporary part-time job."
good,The employees who had been working there for a long time definitely had a certain way they treated the new employees and it wasn't always positive and welcoming and I'll leave it at that!
good,There is not much to say.  This was a good place to work.  Need more businesses to be like this place.  I hope all in my Chill's team are doing great now.
good,"At this restaurant, I learned how to work in a team setting. This was one of my first jobs and where I began to work on my customer service. This was a good learning experience and taught me techniques I use today."
good,My time with Chili's was good! I enjoyed being a server. My favorite thing I like about Chili's was meeting new people. The worst part about it was the hours.
good,"at time it would be very stressful in the middle of the lunch rush but the management was very helpful and supportive, as well as, had patients w/me when I first started."
good,Front of the house workers were friendly but the back of the house was the opposite. Constant arguments and fighting.  No organization. The way they have their kitchen set up made the job harder then it needed to be in all aspects.
good,Good part time.Good place to learn customer service & to learn communicating. More beneficial to join kitchen to learn.Low salary but good tips some times
good,It was just a temporary job overall it was quick money as a teenager with great coworkers and lots of fun people. Management wasn't too bad they just didn't know how to schedule workers
good,line work is extremely hard and built to wear you down. the managers are all awesome though. one free meal a day is probably the biggest perk for working here.
good,I haven't served before chilis and ill forever be grateful for that. I met some nice people who helped me out transportation wise. I loved how everyone was a big family but hours at my location were hard to get.
good,It was an okay place to work. I just have a toddler at home and wanted to work a day shift and not a night shift all the time. Therefore it was putting stress on my family life.
good,"Typical serving job. It is not locally owned, so you answer to corporate standards which can be a good thing. You can schedule yourself easily through a computer system."
good,"• Highly skilled in providing outstanding hospitality services to guests and coworkers"
good,Chillis is a high paced fast action job which one has to complete multiple tasks in a short amount of time and it also requires a high rate of stress tolerance in a highly fast paced work environment
good,"Fast paced work environment, very busy. Clientele is awful though. To be stiffed daily for no reason is a common occurrence even if A+ service is given. Coworkers were great and management was decent."
good,chilis is one of the very best known restaurant not only in uae but all over the world. Foods are great and valuable during my working days there. I only need to leave the company for some personal growth reason and most importantly a better salary offer compared to them.
good,"Get there at open, do opening tasks, work/clean/customer service for the day then close. I learned how to be a leader and a team. Management did what they could to make it an easy fun work."
good,"The workers and managers are cool, but they need bus boys or to tip out the hosts. The hostess does a lot of work for $8.50 an hour. Other than that its a great place."
good,This review is based only on the franchise that I was employed by. The hours are long and and the pace is fast. There is always something to take care of and you have to be able to be in as many places as you can as quickly as you can. You can easily put in 60 hours per week which makes work/life balance impossible. The plus side is that you get to meet and work with a great bunch of people and hopefully make a positive impact in someone's life!
good,"the food service industry is a place to get a start in your career and chilis was a great place to start out.,  it teaches you customer service and how to work with many different people."
good,A typical day was fast-pace & on point. I learned some hard work ethnic being able to experience working here. The restaurant manager that was working there at the time was very bold & often times couldn't tell if he was being serious or not. The workplace culture was fairly enjoyable because there were lots of nice co-workers to work with as a team effort. The hardest part of the job was not being guaranteed when you're allowed to go on break. The most enjoyable part was the people I worked with.
good,I enjoyed the time I worked at chili's. It was a nice work environment and the people and energy were really great. QA was a fast paced job which i enjoyed very much.
good,Chili's is a typical corporate food service job.  There are very clear standards and protocol.  It is a nice first job or for a busy student. the food is delicious.
good,"This location is a franchise, not a corporate restaurant and was horrible at replacing upper management. For example: The newly hired General Manager ordered an employee to clean a gas grill with paint thinner which resulted in multiple employees being seriously hurt in a kitchen fire."
good,"Typical day was come in running! Things started early and continued all day.  I did love working there though. Get people, fun times. My  staff was amazing!"
good,"A typical day at work consist of cleaning tables, greeting costumers at the door and helping servers carry out food to the costumers. I learned how to communicate to costumers. The management is very organized at times but can be a bit aggressive when it comes to supporting employee's needs. The workplace culture is very fast paced and loud. The hardest part about the job is having to deal with angry costumers that aren't satisfied. The most enjoyable part about the job is having really supportive employee's."
good,"I worked at chilis for over a year, I was working 30-35 hours now I'm down to basically 15 hours every two weeks. I gave them my availability to work more and still haven't got more hours"
good,"work place environment is fast pace"
good,"Working as a hostess mostly came with the same tasks and expectations daily; you greet guests, seat guests, and ask about their experience and wish them well upon leaving. It was definitely a job where I got a lot of face to face experience with different kinds of people giving me opportunities to expand on my tactics of customer service. On weekends it was a bit more challenging as the restaurant naturally was more busy, and the waiting times would sometimes make the guests more restless especially if the wait times exceeded 20-30 minutes. This job helped me learn time management as well, and also occasionally put me in high pressure situations with unhappy guests that helped me learn problem solving and customer service tactics. The management was very understanding and often dealing with a lot of different situations in the restaurant all at once, which sometimes made it a bit difficult to get their attention at busy times, but over all, they were very fair with their decisions and management styles."
good,"My biggest issue with this job was that my shifts where not regular. One day I would work for an hour and the following day I would work for 7 hours. The nature of expediter (also known as QA) entails no breaks, a deep understanding of the food, and exceptional communication skills."
good,Great job and work place. Was able to work and be around several people and different personality. The employees I worked with were great. The managers were awesome and worked with me and trained me to be a trainer/supervisor.
good,good job for servers trying to get in the industry. this is a more realistic priced menu with different soups daily great appetizer selections and nice sports bar.
good,"Worked this job for a little over a year, good money and people, definitely fast-paced and demanding. Customer service is the most vital skill here and people were always there. Good short term job for quick cash and food industry entry."
good,A typical work day was a good day. We started each day propmtly at 7am an it consisted of a daily task sheet to follow. The hardest part of the day was waiting to get off of work
good,I enjoyed working with Chili's. Fun workplace and free lunch! We were able to have discounts at other chain restaurants and family discounts! Employees were able to have benefits and able to still go to school/work other jobs while working here!
good,Everything was very unorganized and we were doing way more work than we were getting credit for. Worked long hours for not enough pay. Went above and beyond and got nothing from it. Looking for bigger and better.
good,At the time was a decent environment steady work pace for the most part was okay. The staff was pretty decent had a constant rotation when it comes to management
good,"Chili's from a corporate level, is a really good company. However, on the individual store level, just from the area I worked in, was a train wreck. You were promoted mostly on how long you have been with the company and not your performance with the company. This led to a lot of people getting put into leadership roles who had no idea what they were doing."
good,"I learned a lot from working multiple positions such as a cashier to a line cook, I would say the most satisfying part of the job is seeing the customer happy and satisfied."
good,"this was a long time ago, from what I can remember everything was fine. I didn't really have any problems with fellow employees or management. I think its a pretty strait forward chain restaurant."
good,"It was a great place for a first time manager to work & learn, but it was long hours and a busy restaurant to work in.  I learned a lot from my original GM."
good,I rate this company with 3 stars because it is a good company but it is some changes that could be made and the job work not that bad life balance averages out if you work hard the management is good they work hard and have the ability to listen and the job culture is fine because of the great opportunity to move up
good,"This job is great for someone who is going to school, and needs flexible hours. The pay, really fluctuates by area, and also season for servers. Shift managers, or keys, will find tthat they need to think quick on their feet and be prepared for anything in order to succeed."
good,Management was good.  We were always super busy so the work day went by quickly.  Camradere among team members was good.  It was my first management job and I learned very much and appreciate them giving me the opportunity to grow with them
good,"Get in to work, clock in, wash hands, go to assigned station, clean and stock if needed, and start working on incoming orders. Working in this manner had allowed me to develop an efficient routine that has pervaded other aspects of my life. Management was good and things were taken care of in an appropriate manner. The workplace culture was split between the back of house and front of house, in which people got along with the people in their area. Free meals were a good part of the job, and the hardest part was line coordination but it worked out."
good,"Chili's slogan should ""to get by"" or at least that's the environment they offer. Server's merits are measure by percentages and not entirely by ethic, however, there are some General Managers that have learned to work within these standards while encouraging and managing staff properly. It's a good job to get if you need to make money quickly and offers advancements to go-getters. I would recommend this job to anyone starting in the serving field. Team service allows and (more often than not) forces servers into a ""sink or swim"" environment."
good,This was quite sometime ago. It was my first customer service experience. Very high pace. Responsible for cleaning also. I was entrusted to train new employees.
good,"Chilis is the type of environment where you either sink or swim. The money is good, but sometimes not worth the headache. Overall co-workers work hard and support each other during the chaos."
good,family friendly restaurant. some of the management has been switched up and moved around.. hard to tell if its for the better or worse but I left for the simple fact of being used and abused and mistreated.
good,I interacted with every guest that walked in. Most were very friendly. You have to be patient and fast when the place is very busy and there is a wait. You must have good customer service.
good,"Although I made friends, it was a very stressful position and I need full-time employment.  I learned how to handle difficult situations.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with irate patrons."
good,"I had a good experience in the food service industry. I was taught by some supervisors and line-cooks, about the importance of maintaining a professional and clean establishment. I learned about Mexican cuisine and the richness of their culture. I had to learn four different stations of work. The first was salad preparation and creation, and making sure that the leaf was washed and cleaned, before serving. Next was the presentation counter where, I created the platters and plates for guest. The final station to learn was the Grill, where all the meats and poultry was prepared. Here is where I began to improve on my efforts as working as a team. It was a intense and hot place to work, but worth the discomfort at times. "
good,"Great work culture, hard to grow. Don't get many hours in the beginning. Good people, must enjoy working all weekends. The hardest part of the job was working during the slow hours."
good,It's very clicky if you don't fit in you won't last long there... They played favoritism to the employees. My favorite part of this job was with the customers and hearing and seeing all new faces and the regulars that went in..  always had great conversations with them and enjoyed listening to the stories of travels or of family.
good,"Location is crucial if you want to make a decent living serving at Chilis.  I've worked at the best (Flower Mound) and some of the less desirable (locations in Fort Worth), but that being said your coworkers are what make your job (not just at Chilis but anywhere in the SI) great.  I've always liked who I've worked with, and while the location and management may be hit or miss the staff is always the best part of the job."
good,"Fast Paced and Great Customers, Opportunity for advancement. Must love food and interacting with new people every day. Generally people are friendly and very responsive to good hospitality and attentiveness."
good,managers stingy with money and constantly running out of food items or had not maintained equipment. just a company going under ...............................
good,"Muchos beneficios y flexibilidad de horarios, mala administracion del restaurant."
good,I learned a lot about standards in the service industry. Guest experience and satisfaction is a number one priority here. Working here i was able to build lasting relationships with the guests as well as the other team members.
good,"A normal day at work was washing every dish coming in from the front of restaurant, while sweeping the floors and food preparing chicken strips, onions, bell peppers and more."
good,"A nice job for a full time college student. I would recommend the job to other young college students who have limited time to work because of school and sports,"
good,"I learned a lot working at Chili's.  It was the first ""leadership"" job I had held post Marine Corps.  I learned how to delegate and lead by example.  I also learned how cut throat civilian life can be, when i had General Managers talking from one cheek and saying another to someone else.  Overall a good company, I personally don't know how it is now because it was so long ago, but it was fun and it propelled me to advance in my restaurant career."
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo, muchas facilidades de horario."
good,Management wasn't always the best. Hardest part of the job was dealing with the drama that is involved at the restaurant and the management that feeds into it.
good,Chili's is a decent place to work with its highs and lows. Not the worst restaurant management job out there but definitely far from the best. Constant changes that are more often than not for the worse and too many low quality mangers. Very unrealistic corporate standards at times as well.
good,The Chili's in Longview Texas is an OK place to work. Some of the management are good managers and some of the managers are out for themselves. Most of the servers are pretty good. Some of the cooks get special treatment. The management sometimes will work around your schedule.
good,"ok place to work, ok work environment, ok people to work with and around, good place for work advancement and cross training, flexible hours and work schedule"
good,I learned how to seat guests at their table and I learned how to serve them their food.  I also learned how to train the new host staff to do their job.
good,It ok a good place work at fun good mangers good team members clean environment don't need experience put helpful a good place for young people to work
good,"Management is very organized, picking of favorites. Discounts on food is great. Hours are random, no end time. Not enough hours. Left alone during busy hours becomes overwhelming."
good,"As a dish washer there for only a short period of time I only kept to my own area no one really checked up on me too often, i dont know if that was a good thing or a bad one."
good,"Had a hard time with management not allowing a work life balance, as well as the ability to try and move up was very limited and left you out of pay to attempt to advance."
good,A typical day at work starts very slow then it starts to pick up eventually. I learned a lot about customer service and team work and how to keep up with a fast pace environment. The management team was very helpful played a huge roll on helping me learn about the restaurant industry.
good,"enjoyed working here as there aren't many places like it, menu was easy to pickup and remember, managers were nice although one when I was there was not very enjoyable to work with"
good,A decent place to work but they expect more from their employee's than from themselves. This breeds a bitter work environment and causes distrust in co-workers.
good,I truly learned how to work as a team.  The best part of my job was seeing customers happy with their meals.  It was a hectic atmosphere which required constantly interacting with customers and employees.  Restaurant work was enjoyable but don't plan to pursue in again the future.
good,It is very demanding and you must be a people-person. You have sling trays on the frontline to make decent money. If you put in the hours and treat the customer right you can make a decent buck.
good,It's my first time working for a restaurant and at first I liked it but now it's like gives you a lot of pressure but I still overcome the pressure and get the job done
good,I have been with Chili's for almost 6 years and it has been a huge part of my life. Things have changed a bit. Just want to take what I have learned and move on to different experiences.
good,"Company is very fair to work for. They believe in making chilis the brsy job to have in the industry. However, they believe in high productivity from staff and managers. Often leading to minimul staff being scheduled, resulting in burnt out team."
good,"Not what I would recommended to eat and have a career in . I not sure about all of them But I would wouldn't put my all in this particular place. Some management are wonderful. And some are need to real have a seriously confrontation,and there food is excellent to."
good,"Chili's has a mixed review from me. The job culture and engagements with management are excellent and hard work is often awarded appropriately. However, the lack of pay, work hours, and room to expand makes this a somewhat dead end for some employees."
good,"Typical day as Supervisor would involve arriving before the rest of the workers and ensuring each work station in the kitchen is properly stocked and ready for the upcoming lunch/dinner. As each cook arrives, we discuss the plan for the shift (who will work with who and at which specific station.) In the midst of the rush, my duty was to ensure all food items were prepared timely and properly and in accordance with company protocol. As the shift would go on, I would monitor our sales and cut workers as needed to ensure labor remained cost efficient."
good,Good place for as a first learn a lot about food handling knowledge of food hygiene and sanitation by following companies sop.maintaining logs of food
good,i was always busy which i liked.  It was just always so crowded with people around. Management was decent they did their job. I would load and unload the dishwasher all day. It wasn't super hard work but i did sweat sometimes. The hardest part was trying to catch up when we became very busy.  The things i enjoyed most had to be the people i worked with. Some were funny but most were just very respectful.
good,"Loved the brand so much I went into management after college, advancement relied heavily on how well the GM and Area Directors were able to develop their teams."
good,Was a host there for two years in high school. perfect if you're under eighteen but otherwise very hectic and busy. Management was good and the servers were alright
good,"Decent job, management holds favourites, but usually accepts everyone. Hours are good, and the scheduling system is good. Tips are usually good and customers are nice."
good,"Great place to work, plenty of hours when I worked there and always plenty of money to be made. Only downfall was management."
good,"I had a better experience with Chili's in Texas - upper  management inTenness focused less on people and more on the bottom line.  In my experience, if you take care of your people first the bottom line will come"
good,It was an descent experience. Learned some new recipes and ingredients. Saw a new system and different way of doing things that I can take with me that can be helpful in my future.
good,During my stay at chili's I learned about the importance of timing and preparing food as a team and working at very high volumes. Learned a great deAL about teamwork and unity.
good,"I don't receive any hours, but the pay rate was great for that type of job. The General Manager have an attitude most of the time, but other than that it was fine."
good,I would never work for this company again. the management is the worst i've ever had the opportunity to work with. nothing done there was done with i care or professionalism.
good,"Chili's is a solid job to work as a line cook. They train you pretty well and the pay is good too. The only tough part about it is being able to keep up with the orders on busy days, but with a good team, it should run good."
good,"Was a decent place to work, but the car sales world wasn't a good environment for me. Nice demo cars after training and the sales managers were personable."
good,It's not a bad place to work pay was good hours where up and down which is typical in a restaurant. This is a good place loved the pay they offer insurance
good,The company did not train the new employees very well. The restaurant was too busy for any of the other coworkers to train properly. The schedule and pay was great but the management was not very understanding.
good,Serving people on a daily basis. Learnt to deal with different types of people and to communicate well with them. Improved my ability to listen to instructions and teamwork between me and the other staffs.
good,Working at Ups is great the people are too .The people is fun to talk too thing get done faster without any problems.I get things done fast so my driver will be fine and go on break early.
good,The servers were great and the hosts were pretty good too but all the good managers left and we were left with bad ones so yea it was pretty bad in in terms of the managers. Rest of staff was great
good,It gets the job done. It pays the bills. I have learned how to cook things differently. I have made a few relationships. And I have enjoyed it so far.
good,Ok working place to work if you are around the right people and if you have team mates who care about doing their job right like i did and if the management team is great.
good,Great turnaround rate. A lot of the customers are regulars and will continue to come to chilis for years. It is a fun place to work.
good,"Management would want you to come to them but wouldn't help you. Fun environment, fast paced. Loved what I did. I did more than I should've for not enough pay."
good,"The main manager was questionable, but this place was so much fun to work at. Great people and good hours for the most part. I definitely encourage anyone to apply."
good,"They have good food, but when it comes to management they can improve on themselves. Employees are good but need better communication."
good,"If you love being in a family/team environment then this is the place for you! A typical day is like living with aunties, uncles, brothers, and sisters. When its fun its fun but when its under pressure its hard. You fight, you cry, you laugh, you make money if you are good at what you do. I learned how to gain regulars and what it takes to make the money to survive...daily. The menu changes every 3 months so don't fall in love with something because one day its there then the next it may be gone. Turnover rate is very high, managers are pretty much just there to get paid so make sure you don't get attached and know who to trust. Hardest part of the job is not knowing if the MOD is going to help out in the front or the kitchen...one will suffer. Most enjoyable part is if you can create regulars and good reviews then you get the best shifts."
good,just a fun little summer job nothing really more to it it was pretty fun and fast pace work place. other than that it was pretty great first time job
good,great hours and a great schedule. Not very organized though. Long shifts but good money. Lots of micommunication or no communication at all. Mangement played favorites for sure.
good,hours were slowly being cut down. compensation was good. some of the management wasn't that great. the teamwork dynamic was lacking from day shift to night shift.
good,"The culture down here is gettting better, but tips are never where they should be.  I would work for brinker again, just not at chili's GBC.  Just not the right customers."
good,same as above.......good days most of time. speed is what i learned. manaegment was a little un-stable. loved my co-workers. running all stations on a super bust night.....love cooking.
good,"When I was working there, it never seemed to be busy enough for the Server's and Bartender's to make worthwhile money. It was a fun place to work, with great people, but it was hard to justify the amount of work that had to be done to make a decent living."
good,Chili's is definitely a great place to start. I learned the basics when I started serving here and it brought me greater opportunities. There is definitely consistency to working for Chili's because it is a corporate restaurant but it's not for everyone
good,"If you are looking into the server position, there is no per hour rate, solely tips which are split with bartender and hostess. the customers are not the greatest tippers and are not respectful. Unpredictable hours week to week."
good,i learned that you can make work fun but it can also be hard but you get better at it every day i k=liked how i got to greet people and sit them and ask them how there day is going my job was to make sure they come in happy and leave happy
good,I loved the fast pace and the people I worked with. I had many regular guests. I loved bartending here. Hardest part was coworkers who were not team players.
good,constant greeting n seating. management is okay some let the name go to there head.co manager was nice but bossy. nothing was hard honestly. daddy daughter day is the best day bc hostess is over all the games n arts n crafts.
good,Don't expect too much.This is the kind of job you work at for just a job and not a career unless you move forward as a regional or district manager. Anything else is just not worth the stress IMO.
good,the best part of  chilis in meeting new people and enjoying great company with awesome customers and  the hardest part is trying to get everything done in time
good,"Chili's can be a great place to work at. If you're a server, you can expect to make a decent living. Our store is located right next to an interstate exit by a convention center which made it highly profitable. However, if you work as a cook you can expect to be under a lot of stress. People are constantly quitting. Like any place, there are some good managers that care and help and some not so good that are incompetent and makes life miserable."
good,This was one of my first jobs. It was a great experience for a first job. I stopped working there for school and extracurricular activates at the time.
good,"A typical day is either under or over staffed. Mostly not enough wait staff. A great place to work if you like running your own food on a 20 minute ticket time, traying up your own food, greet all 5-7 tables, grab all there drink order, bus your own tables, run all your drinks yourself and then get complained to because the service wasn't good and getting bad gem scores on the ziosk which is the thing they base your shifts on. Poor scores equal poor shifts. If there was an expo on and maybe an extra host service might be a little better,"
good,"it was a great experience, it help me while i was going to school, great place to build costumer service skills. skills that will be used in the future. it is also a great place if you are looking for a career in the restaurant industry"
good,I enjoyed work at Chilis specifically because of my co-workers. They made work something to look forward to everyday. We got everything done and had fun at the same time.
good,a typical day consists of multiple customers at once and providing the best service to all while maintaining a clean and comfortable dining environment.
good,The hardest part of the job was that it was high pressure at times. The most enjoyable moment was greeting the customers and seeing them leave the restaurant content.
good,This location has poor management along with employees. It was not the best place to work. There is a lot of disrespect shown to each employee by other employees.
good,its very complicated working at chilis u have to be flexible coz we serve different nationality. the manager sometimes help us do our job.
good,Fun place to work so many new experiences working there and all was so muck fun and the bosses were all was so kind and fun to be around
good,Fine place to work.I just needed to better myself. A typical day was enjoyable. I learned a lot about multi- tasking. Management was fair. I enjoyed co-workers and still keep in touch with many.
good,"Very high Volume store. Every one worked there as a team helping managing the flow of the lunch and dinner shifts. I learned customer service the most here because I had the job for four years. Became promoted with a bartender job there which I indeed loved more than serving. Also being promoted to shift leader, which is a job title that helps out the entire restaurant under management "
good,I think the management team needs alot of work. the first year I was there was nothing but kitchen problems from day one. there is manjor problems with the kitchen
good,"It was a okay job, they wanted us to get guest to use the presto's to pay on them, and do survey's. With that there's some things on the survey that I have no control over and I would be given a bad review, and the surveys make you or break you on how you are scheduled. Few of the managers would scream at me for making a mistake that wasn't my fault."
good,"Work environment can be very stressful, but if you like cooking and preparing food then this is the job for you. Obviously this is a entry level food job so with decent pay slightly above min. wage"
good,"I worked at Chili's from August of 2015 to April of 2016. It was a great learning experience but I would like to know that I have an opportunity to advance in the company and have good coworkers that work together as a team. "
good,"Large amounts of stress."
good,"Chili's gave me good practice and skills to deal with customer service and with dealing with my co-workers. Typical days on the job were usually busy and a lot of multitasking, but it wasn't anything I couldn't handle. When I first started the management was great and there to help me in every way possible, but towards the end, the people changed and they weren't as great as the management I first started with. There was a lot of issues with communication between the workers and the management towards the end which lead me to quitting because I was being treated poorly and I felt like my voice and opinions didn't matter. Overall, I can say I learned a WHOLE lot of experience with not just dealing with customers but with how to act on the job and how to succeed and be strong."
good,A day in that life is hectic. It was constant Chaos. I had many duties that I had to do. There was never one Job and you stick to it. I learned that there are some really mean people in the world. The management was not up to standard there was one. He was constantly being unprofessional. My co-workers were people so it hard to judge them some of them brought their problems from home to work which is always a bad thing and it makes it hard for the other people who are coming there to work to do their job professionally. The hardest part was dealing with people who came there to get free food as their main plan they would be extremely rude. The most enjoyable part would be when we would get together just to hangout. It was nice seeing people outside and how they are different from work.
good,"I have a tremendous amount of respect for the ladies and gentlemen in the food industry because it can present quite a challenge. Being the first job I had, I had absolutely no idea as to what to expect when I began working there and I learned quickly that if you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen."
good,"Did not work there for long so I can not really say much but did like every job as server, I serve and greeted guest and taking orders. Did the end shift cleaning and help roll silverwares"
good,"Learned a lot of valuable skills in the kitchen. From starting as a dishwasher to moving to a fry/ appetizer cook. Then rotating to all cooking positions on the line; salad/dessert, grill, flat top, and prep."
good,"I have learned the importance of people skills, when I am serving I have to make sure I serve with a smile. There are hard parts to every job this job can be very busy and that can tend to get stressful, but I always keep a positive attitude. On the other hand I love getting to interact with new people and getting to know them, also seeing the regulars come in."
good,"you will learn to be sales driven person. teamwork and multitasking is really essential in this kind of environment, and the restaurant is always busy"
good,"It is a good opportunity at chili's for me. It is a stepping stone in my life and they have been very accommodating towards my needs and hours i would like to work. Most employees there are willing to help anyone, then there are  the ones who are money hungry. I have only been emotional there once and am very good with customers. Some who work there cry almost every shift, this job is not for everyone."
good,"I have been with this company a long time and saw alot of changes, and although change is good. This change did not help the common worker. Although i am still employed there, i know i need to set my goals into a better brand. so like a relationship.. its not them its me. Time to move on"
good,"A typical day at work meant getting to work and then doing 3 jobs other than my own, with little to no help from management. It made me learn that I do not like working in restaurants anymore. I had a few managers who were helpful but a GM who was not. My coworkers were for the most part helpful but there was often drama. The hardest part of my job was being told to do 3 other jobs,not including my own, with no help."
good,I performed the same responsibilities and job duties at both chili's restaurants. i just transferred because i was relocating to California
good,Exactly what the summary says. The work was what you would expect from a restaurant job there was just too many turnover's. I went through at least 4 managers and 5 coworkers before i decided i didn't want to put up with it anymore.
good,"Fast paced restaurant, team work needed, ran everyone's food, made own deserts.  Checked in about 5 and clocked out about 10pm."
good,I absolutely loved working at chili's. Management keep the place fun and there was always good money. The environment was great and the type of people you severed for the most part was very kind.
good,"great music, great food and coworkers always makes it an enjoyable place to work.  The management was always willing to work with the new guys to make sure they would fit in and be suitable for the job"
good,In Pine Bluff it will really teach you to how to deal with all types of situations. The diversity of team members and guest give you great tools to become a well rounded manager.
good,"not too bad, people are okay with the exception of managment, which can be flat out douche bags. not too many people seem to care that this place is just a front for the illegal drug smuggiling and prosttiution going on in the back."
good,I was not with this company long enough to give them the due justice of a review. It was my first job in the Restaurant Business
good,great job to work at if the store manager actually didn't stay stressed and take it out on his employees. as for the other managers they were great.
good,I felt that this company didn't want to advance their employees careers although I was very happy while working here. The hours get old in the restaurant business but overall there were no complaints.
good,"The restaurant industry is a tough environment, but I learned that I could perform in pressure situations.  There isn't a lot of glory or money involved, but it feels good to get things accomplished."
good,went in to a new environment  adapted to there style of cooking in a short time mangers are fair very well rounded kitchen. half of the time being in a kitchen no one worked as a team but when we did we had a better result of kitchen.
good,Fun place to work while going to school. The building is brand new with all of the nicest and newest bells and whistles in the kitchen. Huge bar area with lots of TV's and all of the sports channels to go with it. Management needs to improve on operating practices.
good,"I worked for chili's about four years ago and I liked the quick pace."
good,me and the manager never saw eye to eye even when i would come in whenever asked and even when i came in on a broken ankle and worked.
good,"I like cooking and working with food, but the job was very demanding. Long hours and never knowing what time we were getting off."
good,Serving guest good quality food. Co-workers were easy to work along side with. For the most part management staff was good and had weekly or even sometimes daily contests.
good,"Meeting new people great staff and management. Not all about the numbers but into the people and how they develop."
good,Fast paced work environment with room for advancement. Learned how to deal with difficult customers in a professional and sincere manner.
good,"nice plave to work, but never know the day will be like, the sidework can take a long time to do and cant be completed until the very end of the night. sometimes managers take a long time to make cuts and it can be frustrating"
good,"Great income with tips allowed. Great for college. People were nice and again, I was allowed to work my section with wide margins to time manage my tables. Great people."
good,"Rolling silverware in the morning, seating guests, clearing tables. I learned social skills, and different duties being my first job."
good,"Chili's provides a well oriented and organized work flow rutine. Provides health insurance and employee discounts."
good,Drinks on Drinks on drinks you have to make drinks for restaurant and your guest as well as be personable and able to make everyone comfortable as well as still help out around the kitchen.
good,"Chilli had a positive environment full of energy even if though it's a fast paced job that required me to be on the go it was a great experience. On a typical day I prepared a variety of foods such as meats vegetables and deserts. I also assist the kitchen with various tasks, provided them with proper equipment when needed. There were times I had to work hard under pressure but because we had a great team which included management and co-workers team work made the dream work."
good,chili's has a very great atmosphere for some one who does not mind  working in a very fast paced  environment this is not a job for some one who is shy and not a peoples person
good,"Fun yet stressful as is any job where one has to provide a service.  The customers were demanding and rude, the kitchen staff was as well.  Management ranged from poor to excellent."
good,Chilis is a very busy place to work. I worked in the very back of the kitchen doing prep work.The mangement really pushed you to get your work done and leave early.
good,"Every day was pretty easy we would get or occasional pops that come and go with the flow of the mall. Everyone who works their seem to be real up beat and positive, it's almost impossible to be in a bad mood at work with that group."
good,"My coworkers were friendly and sociable, but their lack of care for organization, or even for keeping the store clean was astounding. The servers were notoriously lazy when it came to putting things in the trash that were not my responsibility to throw away, or putting dishes where they belonged to make them easily accessible to me so they wouldn't become unbalanced mountains waiting to fall and break. There was never an apparent penalty for breaking any of the dishes, so there were multiple occasions of plates and such getting broken with only a laugh and attempted cleanup following."
good,"Low bonus structure, fair health benefits.  Mediocre company to work for.  High turnover for management.  Not very structured."
good,"A typical day at Chili's is like most other days at typical restaurants. I've been serving since I've been 18 so there wasn't too much to learn. My co-workers are awesome. They've been working together for quite a while, so it may take some time for them to open up"
good,Great starting job. I enjoyed meeting new people. Management made hours very flexible for me while i attended school. Co workers were awesome
good,Good work place. Clean and friendly environment. Sunday is the busiest day of a week. I like busy time in working. Monday is less busy. Its a part time job.
good,"Chilis was not horrible, but Ive had better jobs. No breaks after stressful shifts made it difficult. Most management were hands-off so it made it hard to feel like they were actually part of the team at times.Co-workers were amazing, they made the job tolerable. Hard to get promoted, as the higher management kept hiring from the outside."
good,"•	Experienced and handled high stress environments"
good,The job for me is im front of the house and im the one who's leading the guest to the table and explaining about our promo and about the menu and mentioning the server's name. Its a little bit boring but the enjoyable part is i taking the order and make like a server and also helping may manager to make some task in computer so i enjoy it because i learn to much about that the management is good but the problem only is our salary the staff also nice
good,a typical day at work was hectic. I really didnt learn much with this company. Management was very bad and the managers were just rude. co workers were nice. the hardest part of the job was feeling unorganized because the managers were so unorganized.
good,It is pretty much what you would expect from working in a restaurant. It is extremely fast-paced and can be hectic. I learned how to pay close attention to detail.
good,"Typically, to do the job you must be able to memorize the menu, affectively take orders, greet customers within the first five minutes, get their drinks and meals to them the way they want them. Everyone helps each other out. Managers effectively keep the team together and in check. The hardest part is keeping all customers satisfied. The best part of the job is seeing customers pleased with your work ethic."
good,Learned alot from operating a multi-million dollar restaurant. The training program in Mishawaka IN was a great experience for personal and business.
good,Decent pay but they don't seem to value their employees much. Most of the managers I worked for were unprepared and ill trained for their job. They don't seem to respect workers or care about anything but making more money.
good,It's a very nice place to work. Everyone was very friendly. Very fast paced job. Management worked to make sure everyone did there job correctly and as a team.
good,"Its a corporate restaurant, what do you expect. Its what made me want to go to college and further my education. Not a bad job, but between changing locations and the severe difference in management styles, I can only say that there is little to no structure to this business in regards to the every day worker. Also, ever restaurant has the same idea. Good location = good tips."
good,I Enjoyed working there it is just that they continued to cut hours even though  I am I minor they didn't give me more than 20 hours.
good,"Managers will scream and cuss at you if they are stressed out, and handle many guest issues unprofessionally. You can make OK money on the weekends."
good,"Chili's was an estimated five minutes away from where I lived and it was the restaurant I worked in the longest and the first place that taught me what team work was all about. Like any other corporate restaurant it consisted of a lunch and a dinner shift. Often times i would work double shifts to maximize my profit. My co-workers were exceptional, kind, selfless, and knowledgeable and they taught me how to be just that. I also learned how to work at a fast and efficient speed and to treat all my tables is one giant table by consolidating steps. The hardest part of the job was keeping the intensity up around 8 or 9 o clock on a double shift and the most enjoyable part of the job were the people I worked with who helped me get through the shifts."
good,worked very hard and very fast. when the shift was over the accomplishment was so empowering that my work ethic was improved beyond measure.
good,Always for something for me to do to keep the movement going and great positivity with co workers. Had many regulars come in for me for my hospitality and genuine care.
good,The West Jordan chilis was an awesome place to work at until the whole management for the restaurant changed.  It can be a great place to work at only if you get along with everyone.
good,Fast paced work environment that allows for very minimal breaks. You definitely learn how to master multi tasking and need essential math skills to be able to succeed in such a fast paced workplace. Staff is friendly and very flexible with hours.
good,Worked the like in a fast paced kitchen. Team oriented. I learned how to get food out in a timely manner while not compromising quality.
good,"Best part of job, the team. Otherwise continue looking theres probably better out there for you"
good,A typical day at work would be serving guest food and drinks. We would work with other team members to ensure the guests had the best experience possible. I would learn different food and drink items and also how to deal with undesirable guest. My management  is very helpful in trying to achieve the best customer service and creating happy employees. My company thrives for team members to work together and help as much as you can. The hardest part of the job is having no control on the level of guest and business. Some days we are so slow and do not make much money. The most enjoyable part of the job is being rewarded by creating the best guest experience.
good,"a day at work for me is a evening shift where i handle customers and provide excellent services for them."
good,"A typical day at work was comparable to that of any other corporate restaurant. It began coming into work, checking over your section and proceeding to be a little bit of every position until the entire staff came in for the evening. While I was only a server, I was expected to be a hostess, as well as an expo, a rood runner, ToGo specialist and dishwasher. I cannot speak for all Chilis nor for the managers at them but my specific location there was no management/ employee help the majority of the time; you were your own manager as well until you needed a bill adjusted. The hardest part about the job was working with little to no communication between the management and rest of employees; in an environment where you are supposed to be one big team, there was no team work. The most enjoyable part about the job was the customer service, there was always an abundance of people and whether it be a good day or bad day it didn't matter; the people and food is why I loved to work in the industry."
good,Great place to learn leadership and develop people skills which will assist in everyday life.
good,I really enjoyed the customer service that this company provides to their guests.
good,cooking clean washing dishes always be prepared for the next customer
good,Typical day consists of serving and waiting on tables. Talking to Guests. Very busy on the weekends. carrying heavy trays of food out to your tables.
good,its not that i hate this job but i think there are a lot of areas that need improvement that's all i will say
good,Only get paid three dollars a hour without good tips. Learned how to give better costumer service
good,"Excellent opportunity in corporate restaurant management."
good,Every day was exciting learning new receipts from the coworkers. The day went by every fast preparing the food and learning from the management.
good,This is a fun loving positon where I get to interact with different people on a day to day basis.  I see this as an opportunity to develop my skills that I already possess and learn different values and aspects of opinions through conversion and by building raport with other employees.
good,This position enhanced my customer service skills as well as organization and teamwork.
good,"Management tends to give split-shifts, where you work about 12 to 14 hours per day with a 1 to 4 hour break in between shifts. Days like that, it's an all-day work day. Forget about plans or doing anything else those days."
good,It was a fun work environment and happy place to be. I loved all my co workers and all the guests too.
good,great place to work at. Friendly coworkers and great mangers
good,"A typical day at work was very simple.  The co-workers were very caring and always offered help.  The management team was not very helpful and offered no help in trying to maintain guest satisfaction throughout the restaurant.  The hardest part of the job was to cater to each guests specific needs and communication style, which was the main lesson that I have learned from working in the service industry.  The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that guests would leave satisfied and that I had a hand in it."
good,"Chili's Bar and Grill was a great place to work at.  I started off as a cook and left as a manager.  They promote from with in first before looking outside. The administration (operations) always keep you informed with all the changes that goes on through out the restaurant, training,certifications, inspections."
good,was a very good place to work doing all the different meals meeting new guest a real great place
good,Chili's is a very well ran restaurant. Managers are decent.
good,Great experience. The workplace is high energy and fast-paced.
good,Great serving place to work.  Co-workers very nice and helpful.  Managers trained well.
good,There wasn't too much to be excited about on the job but the most enjoyable part of the job was communicating with my employers and the customers on a day to day basis.
good,Chili's is a great place to work the Management is great and so are my co workers.  They don't have really and chance of advancement or healthcare and that is why I am looking for another job.
good,Chili's is great for families so the business is consistent.
good,Loved working. People were very outgoing and helpful. The hardest part of working was trying to get the orders right.
good,"There were many fun times at Chili's, but it was more fun than work on most days."
good,"It was fun at first. I took the job just to make money to get me through college. The turn over rate was high, even for managers. Therefore nothing was consistent. I had multiple encounters with multiple facets of people so it helped me with my communication skills."
good,"Worked mostly night shift"
good,"Providing customer service and team work."
good,It is just like any other serving job I have had! could've been worse! could've been better!
good,"Working as a cook, Chili's required long hours, and hard work to ensure good quality of foods and customer services"
good,"Overall good place for quick money, if you are okay with waiting tables."
good,"good coworkers, great atmosphere. kitchen is slow on busy nights. most enjoyable part of the job is the interactions with all different types of people. the hardest part of the job is that people tend to not tip here at the mall or leaving less than 5%. it makes it very hard to live."
good,"Chili's is a great place to enjoy your job with your fellow hard working co-workers. My only quam with Chili's was the fact if you rise above expectations you will not be fairly compensated, stating that it was my fault for my rapid progression"
good,"Worked for 4 years happily, got a new general manager and had troubles with his style of management.  He spent most of the time in the back office.  The store has since closed and he was fired."
good,"The manager of the restaurant at the time made the job very enjoyable. Tips were decent and sometimes free food was offered after work. However, the food wasn't very great."
good,Typical day is what you would expect... lots of customers of varying degrees of pleasantness.
good,It is a fairly laid back job.  Most of the co-workers are good people.  As in any job you are not going to get along with every one.  High volume most of the year.
good,"Spent over 12 hours a day at work, and it was an extremely busy and rough environment. It enables you to handle any situation that comes across in work life and outside of work life. It has sharpened my skills to be able to accomplish anything else, because after Chili's everything else is a piece of cake."
good,busy during rush hours. customer service was the number one task. co workers was easy to relate with and worked together as a team. i enjoyed everyones positive attitude towards giving great customer service for enjoyable nights.
good,These people were ok to work for. Management would sometimes make a bigger deal of situations then needed. They also made it a little more difficult to get hours then needed.
good,i learned that it was i would say the best job i have ever had. i had fun while i was working there because i had learned so much and i had worked so many hours that i basically learned everything about the job on the inside out. i would of loved to become manager
good,"Results driven, talent is developed within.  Focus on OZ principles which are very useful."
good,Good company with good food. The staff and management were nice and more than willing to help with accommodating your personal life. There were nice discounts on food and employee meals were definitely something to look forward too. Strong and fun training crew made the entire experience a blast.
good,Working as a waitress for Chili's was fun and enjoyable in my younger years. The atmosphere and money were good at that time in my life. The management and fellow co-workers were a great group of people.
good,Chili's was a good company to work for. Has insurance benefits and they pay according to experience.
good,"I did alot of prep and cooking. The management were very nice people but had trouble trying to tell the older waitresses that have been there for 10+ years how to do their job. They didn't like the new changes and beleived they should keep doing things their way. I did like the employess but the place was a hassle. To much chaos and to many people thought they were boss. If you weren't part of certain people's group they you were considered and outsider and they didn't want to work with you when you needed help, but for the most part they were nice when there wasn't work to be done."
good,I enjoyed my job there. Got laid off when the economy slowed down.
good,"long hours no breaks ,coworkers are at arms lengh at all times"
good,It's a restaurant. You get tired of people very easily. Customers who are hungry can be very rude. The management is well enough. But managers don't know how to use everyone to the best of their abilities and end up just causing conflict. Overall it's okay. Not the best job but not the worst either.
good,Became very knowledgable about marketing promotions and brand marketing
good,"Its A Nice Place To Work, Really active Place, Fast Paced Movement, Managers Work Out With You With Any Problems, Crew Workers Get Along Together."
good,Bartending at Chillis you must start the shift with a smile and a full stocked bar that way you can serve your guest happy and ready. I learned how to make delicious margaritas as well as other great drinks. It was my responsibility to train new hires.
good,This is a fun place to work if you want a fast paced place to work. Customers (for To-Go) are generally friendly and leave tips.
good,"I worked as a bartender. I was responsible for the bar guests, making drinks for the wait staff and putting together to go orders."
good,"Chili's was a pretty easy job, the customers were easy to handle and never really complained all that much. It was a casual dining establishment so it wasn't terribly stressful. I worked at 3 locations, one in New York and two in California and the management was excellent at all 3 locations"
good,"llevar platillos a los clientes, cobrar las cuentas, "
good,"fast-paced enviroment, clock in and start right away cant waist any time need to catch up so when it gets to rush hour it will go smooth. I learned the routine on how to get things done so I wont get backed up on all the pans, plastic containers and dishes. the managers are nice and pleasent people they ask if your alright or if you need something to drink. my co-workers are running back and forth bring in all the dirty dishes, but are fun to work with they are all friendly. the most hardest thing is the pre-close because thats when all the big pots, pads and etc come in at once so i have to move alot faster. the best time of the day is when Im completely caught up with all the dishes so I could take a break."
good,Always a fun job but the pay was very dependent upon how many customers came in each day.
good,I love my co-Workers & most management. I've learned better customer service skills and being put in difficult situations. A typical day at work is conversing with new/old customers building relationships but also dealing with at least ONE difficult customer a day. 
good,"it was a very bad place to work, bad hours and management was never on point. "
good,This is a place where I grew up as a person.  It taught me how to communicate with other and to be respectful
good,I stood at the front of Chilis and greeted every customer and then seated them according to my seating chart. 
good,The business was so poorly managed at the location I worked at. Very unprofessional and an extreme lack of care. Staff was very irresponsible which made for a stressful workplace
good,"Great group of people, fast paced environment - very clean, thoroughly enjoyed the time I spent there."
good,"Overall tis job is pretty enjoyable, the hardest part is that you do have to have a very bubbly as well as tough skin to deal with the public especially when it come to their food. the best part is the reaction people have when you have given a successful dining experience."
good,"Good working and communication with managers, as a family but there is opportunity for growth."
good,"A typical day would consist of taking orders and from guests and ringing them in. I've learned how to multitask better than ever before. I enjoy working with all my teammates. There really wasn't anything too hard about working at chilis, it was basic common sense. The most enjoyable part of the job was all the fun activities we were able to attend."
good,"Good pay, fun work environment, enjoyed my responsibilities."
good,I made a lot of money at Chili's but was required to clock out when my last table paid and work for free for 1-2 hours to close the restaurant so that I could work a 5 day schedule. Bombarded by so many customers that it was stressful and difficult to do a good job with every table of customers.
good,"did dishes and no stress, nothing, Good, Good, Putting up with waitresses,Relaxing enviroment"
good,good place to start out but not much room for advancement if you have a little bit of a goofy personalty.
good,Pretty good place to work as a side job. Not the best place as a fulltime job. Good about working with your schedule.
good,"Nothing fancy, a great starting job. Very busy. Would have loved a more understanding management team"
good,"What you learn will stay with you for your life. Financial and management perspectives, one can learn to rise above."
good,"The job is a great place to start out for students looking to make some extra cash while in school. Hours are relatively flexible, and the staff is friendly. A bit difficult at some times when managers schedule too few employees and the restaurant becomes full, but overall, a nice place to work."
good,the most enjoyable time is laughing and talking with co-workers
good,The job seemed promising but the faulty management soured the experience
good,"My job is a high stress working environment that requires a manager to wear multiple ""hats"". I am responsible for staffing levels, training, cleanliness, invoices, security, product quality, budgets, ordering, etc."
good,"This job was very convenient for me to have as I was taking care of sick parents at the time. The hours were flexible. The hardest part of the job was being busy and having to manage making drink for the bar rail, the restaurant, take orders, and manage the register all at the same time."
good,These guys worked me in an extreme case. They were always short employees so it was nothing to have to work doubles and on my days off. I hated it
good,This Restaurant was a great environment to work in. They have a large menu to choose from and some great items to enjoy.
good,Chili's is great to work at because it provides a flexible schedule
good,Fun atmosphere but very high stress. Great people and ability to move forward. Low staffing and a lot of hands on work.
good,I would come to work and start waiting tables. It was a good job. I learned more about serving and the food industry. The management was nice and so were my co-workers. The service/food industry isn't easy but it was enjoyable to provide customers with good food and service.
good,Average set up and break down of work stations.
good,"People are great, customers are great but constantly changing formats of working. Would be better if they tried to incorporate personal values rather then chain molds."
good,fast paced work day. I learned how to work without mistakes because the managers were not always available. I also learned how to resolve problems without manager assistance. The most enjoyable part of working would be the interaction with my co-workers. We really had a way of keeping ourselves in a positive mood to maintain an enjoyable experience for the guests.
good,Chili's has very flexible scheduling and staff are fun to work with. We offer great food and service and I enjoy working there
good,good place but not enough hours and i want something full time because i would like to start a career.
good,"This was my favorite job so far, I taught myself everything I did at Chili's."
good,"A typical day at work I would work the togo cash register and host by myself. I learned how to multi task at this job, I learned how to control situations without management around. Management wasnt very professional. My co workers were great. The hardest part about the job was working the whole front end by myself. The most enjoyable part of the job were the customers."
good,"A busy, high energy work environment. Full of excitng well rounded people."
good,"Besides poor management skills at Chili's, it is a great restaurant to work at with a lot of flexibility and opportunity to make money."
good,"It could be a lucrative job if you put in the hours. Managers were great, the GM not so much. I helped fill in many positions when understaffed, it was usually appreciated by the manager on duty."
good,It was a good place to work until they started offering discounted food. After that you’d need twice as many customers to make up for the checked being so low
good,"I loved this job. The people are often great people . I have maintained employment with Chili's off and on for about 10 years most of the time its smooth sailing , Although Chili's has worked tirelessly to change their format from casual dining to fast casual dining seems they forgot what makes Chili's great and that is their staff from the front all the way to the back . What has been hurting the employees is the extremely low cost dining and promotions that lead to overwhelming the line without the additional staff to back it up leaving cooks and other kitchen staff overwhelmed with daily tasks . Front of house members of staff are well taken care of and they are happy , Kitchen staff not so much . They do have excellent advancement opportunities if you meet their criteria for advancement . Chili's has a family like culture that is great . The dish position is a very physically demanding position with a majority of hours at night. Kitchen employees are offered a free meal for their shift (best perk)."
good,Chili's is like any corporate restaurant. Management can make or break a store. They only offer your typical medical and retirement benefits but do not offer any vacations or holiday pay (excluding management). You can ask for specific schedules but again it entirely depends on management.  People can move up fast if they commit and perform. Culture and service generally is pretty good with guests but nothing outstanding or unique compared to other corporate chains.
good,I've been working for chili mostly all my life and Florida and Texas I really like to go back I'm a hard kitchen worker that's all I've been doing is this washer kitchen helper I really like the team know everything about the dishwasher how to work it how to clean it I really like the kitchen job
good,"They didn't care much about my personal schedule and that I am a student, unless you want to work 4 to 6 hours 5 days a week as a student, I wouldn't recommend this job."
good,"While I worked at chilis, it was okay in the beginning, but the managers did not really care about their employees at all. I ended up not liking working there."
good,"I am a college student working as a server, it can pay the pills but it can make it tight if it’s slow. It’s a good job if students or busy people who needs aids money."
good,It's a cool place to work for like a high school student or a college student ...not many hours...the servers look like they are in hunger games whenever a table becomes available...high turnover rate...very up and down as far as business but it's usually slow during the early week...they kind of string you along...they gave me a raise...it's cool ...just temporary though ..
good,The place is never empty. It is always full of customers and low on employees. The managers are not bad but the salary is awful compared to the work we have to do. It is exhausting and dirty. The people are really good. They treat us nice but the don't pay us enough.
good,You have to be a quick learner. I am and I was still struggling. You need to memorize the menu and what items accompany which dishes. You need the patience to deal with difficult customers and be great at multitasking.
good,"I'll say if this is your first restaurant job, I personally wouldn't recommend it as the training was terrible. Shifts were not set as seemed to be implied."
good,"Training there was basically non existent but I catch on to things quick just need to see it once. So that being said it took less than a month before I was closing the restaurant checking people out. Sometimes I would walk in and just see people work less because they know I’ll pick up the slack. Things dirty because they know when I get there it’ll be cleaned. I tell my mangers, nothing."
good,"It wasn’t a difficult job per se, but I never got enough hours, and the host stand gets pretty lonely. You have to work there at least 2 months before you can start getting discounts"
good,It was a fun place to work. I had a lot of regular customers that requested me. The tips were crazy good. Bills always paid. Always cash ar end of shift.
good,"I have always gotten along with coworkers in the couple jobs I've had in my teenage years. Chili's was a great start to my serving career, but I am trying to find a job where I make a set wage...not make money based off of business or guests' will to spend more money for tips. I would like to work in a warehouse or airport. I want to have a strong team that likes to help each other out. I am a strong team player because of my work ethic; I like to accomplish things and meet others' needs because it'd be wrong not to. I put in the work that a company needs."
good,It provided decent income for short amount of hours. The people I worked with were friendly and helped out as needed. It was a good experience but not one I would return to.
good,I don’t get paid enough for how much I put into my day of work but it is a great place to work. Wonderful environment. The people are great and the pay could be better. The guests can be a little too much but that’s what the restaurant business is. You gotta do what you gotta do.
good,This was a good place to make money. The staff was decent for the most part. Lots of long ticket times that hurt your tips. Good luck getting a manager to talk to tables when there are issues. Majority of mine spent their time in the office.
good,"There was never any downtime. Every shift had employees working hard. Efficient, but caused burnout very quick. Not a great career, but a valuable job for learning teamwork, speed, and high stress work management."
good,"Chilis was a cool place to work when I first started but a couple years into it now and I just need something new.. I’m finding it hard to have a life outside of work I don’t get the time off I ask for, or can’t make plans or appointments or anything because the schedules aren’t constant it changes every week and it gets super stressful at times, the amount of work you have to do after just to go home is crazy... If you like the restaurant life this is all for you but if you want more out of life this probably isn’t the job for you."
good,"This particular Chili's is all college kids. Securing hours is difficult but if you get the right shifts its alright. The management needs to get it together, they don't agree most days and its very noticeable."
good,I liked working there the hours were nice and the coworkers were great. it always smelled good and the managers never said anything if you got some french fries to snack on
good,I really liked working at chili's but the job is very fast pace so it can be stressful at times. I just wish they could have offered me more hours so that I could've made more money and didn't have to look for a new job
good,Working at chilis was a fun job even though I was temporary I loved being able to seat customers and clean the work area and the management was great!
good,It was an okay place to work. You stayed busy most of the time but at times it is so slpw they send you home right away. I would consider part time work again
good,"Enjoyable place to work until you get to know individual serves and drama arises. Lots of people willing to help with any kinda of situation on the floor or in the kitchen. Hardest part of the job would be handling 8 or 10 tables at once while coordinating with other waiters, as well as the QA running food. Best part of the day is knowing that you made someones day rather a birthday or a get together and of course counting tips at then end of the night."
good,"My job as a hostess was fun, I  was able to meet interesting people. It got busy st times but nothing I wasn’t able to handle . My co workers were all awesome I got along well with the managers."
good,"Management was hard to work with and did not take well to advice. They struggled to get more line cooks, and because of that I had to work more hours than we agreed to. Temporary job to pay for school."
good,"Pro's - Great company culture, good pay and benefits, nice hip uniforms, free meals, operations excellence"
good,"Working as a server here is nothing compared to working at a high end restaurant, obviously. Some days wouldn't seem worth working a stressful double to walk out with $65 in your pockets. With tips, you average about $9.50 an hour."
good,You’ll always find something that aggrevates you in a kitchen. It can be extremely stressful sometimes and at others you can be relaxed. All in all there’s to many highs and lows to appropriately staff this kitchen every week. The turn over rate is exceptionally high
good,While I was working for the company they were going through a lot of management changes. They had all been changed from when I first started there. Because of that there was a lot of confusion between how the new people did things compared to how the old ones did it.
good,Most of the people here a great to work with and is the reason I stayed at this job as long as I did. There is a frequent change in management so it made it difficult to ever fully get accustomed to each ones guidelines and what is expected of each. For the most part the people there are great to work with but it can be challenging because it's an old kitchen and things break down regularly.
good,I enjoy working in a tight team atmosphere. And that’s what it was there . The seasonal promotions were easy up sales .  What you need to know is it’s a great place to work . Kitchen crew was in my top 3
good,"Working at Chili's was really fun and I enjoyed it however when I asked about moving up from Host to Server (which I made clear I wanted to do during my interview) I was told I would have to find my own replacement if I wanted to do so, even though both new hosts and servers were being hired at that time, so I just felt kind of stuck in a position that I really only applied for to get more experience in the first place."
good,Great learning environment with room for advancement. Work life balance was difficult to maintain with a family. Evening in times changed and made it frustrating to adjust my family schedule .
good,"Dishwashing isn't very hard until you start developing trench foot from all the water falling unto your feet all day. Your hands will also get very soggy and become more vulnerable to cuts. You can kiss your nails goodbye with this job...heck you can kiss your hands goodbye. I actually had to stop clipping my nails for the purpose of using my fingernails as tools to peel the stickers on the food prep dishes. Morning shifts feel unfair, they're not hard but you're required to get so much done in such a small window of time in the mornings and so it feels impossible to get every task done by the time the restaurant opens. The only way you can finish the morning tasks on time is if you rush it, in which case you didn't really finish any task 100%. "
good,"high stress as most kitchens are, but the people are supportive and the managers were always willing to listen and help find a solution. It's pretty good."
good,"I enjoyed my time working here as a hostess when I was younger. The management was great and very caring about the staff. It was like a little family. However, it is not someplace I could personally seek career advancement."
good,"Its chilis. its what you would expect. nachos and margaritas for everyone!!! not a bad job, just got really old after a while. not much to complain about"
good,"Awesome job for college students. Must be a multitasker while working in a fast paced busy environment. Need also be a people person and have knowledge of menu, specials, and be able to deal with all types of personalities of the public."
good,Night shift made more tips and was more fast pasted. Team work is key to the system of partner sections. There are no bussing staff so that is the servers responsibility but means less tip share.
good,"this was my first job ever. I was paid 8.50 and worked about 25 hours a week during the last 2 months of my sophomore year. The management was ok, but we were definitely understaffed. we had to go on waits when there seemed to be no need to because the kitchen was always backed up. It's pretty easy though, once you get the hang of it."
good,"Chill's was a great place to work. I met several people while working over the years. I just did not feel like i was advancing in my career field. I was surrounded by complacency, and that is just not a healthy environment to be around for myself personally."
good,"I think Chilis is exactly what you expect working at a chain restaurant. Promotions that need to be pushed, management cycled out restaurant to restaurant, and either over/under staffed. If you need quick cash - this is a good place to work."
good,I learned the hardest station soon as I was hired and then a couple months later I was already learning a new position I think I really came to doing both very well of course some days were easier than others
good,If you prefer restaurant business Chili's is a good job for you I don't know much about out of the kitchen but cooking on the grill was a busy quick paced job
good,"Decent job but only decent good money if you're a cook, bartender, or waitress.  You get cut quick if theres not enough customers coming in, but then once busy the few still on the clock becomes overwhelmed.  Discount on the food is great."
good,A typical day at work was very busy especially the weekends but a fun place to work but can be frustrating sometimes if the prep department doesn't do their job. The managers were very nice and respectful. But this particular chillis can be very unorganized at times.
good,"Start prepping  early shrimp,chicken,gravy,corns,flower for breading, wings ,egg rolls,fries. Then change for lunch get all my fry products ready for cooking."
good,all in all a good food industry. the company in that certain country is the downfall because they give the salary late as always and even though there is not a TAX there they still didn't add salary to the employees that leaves us lesser savings left and more expensive food and rent.
good,"This is a very stressful environment, just like any restaurant job.  Chili's pays very well, however, the demand doesn't always make it worth it.  I love the people I work with!"
good,Chili's has a lot of behind the scene test that you have to keep up with that can come across unfair. College kids don't tip. Servers are the only ones held responsible for the return of customers; not cooks.
good,"At the beginning I really liked working at Chilis until management changed then it became stressful. It felt like you always had to stay on  your toes and the managers were working against you. Good company, bad management."
good,"On a typical day it would not be very busy and it would be hard to find something to do, often would stand around doing nothing and I did not enjoy my time working there."
good,staff was great had a lot of co worker who i would hang out with after work the bond you build with people in store is pretty cool chilis has a great vibe
good,"Chilis was my job while I went to college and got my degree in college, it is a great place to work at and very flexible hours. My managers always worked with my hours and made me feel very welcoming at work."
good,"I loved working here,was there for 6 years, co-workers were great, guests were friendly as can be an the money was good , but slowly management went down hill.  Disrespectful managers, that includes their corporate offices, lack of care for their employees , absolutely ridiculous. Would not want to work for that company again unless changes are made"
good,"At times it is a great place to work, although the hours for a manager are demanding. Restaurant management definitely takes away from family time and even though the money is good, your quality of life is less than that."
good,"Stressful; fast-paced; management changes constantly; good daily money; great current manager"
good,"It was your typical food industry job. I started as a hostess, after showing the initiative to cross-train, I was trained to be QA, or Quality Assurance which was basically the go-between for the servers and the cooks. Shortly after that, I was cross-trained on the To-Go/Cashier person, and finally after becoming trained on those three positions and being successful at them, I was cross-trained to serve."
good,"chilis is a nice beginner job as a server, the environment there is very diverse. the work there is sometimes challenging but there is a lot of teamwork. Teamwork makes the dreamwork."
good,"Not a bad job, as a server anywhere you get people who don't tip, people who are rude, and of course lazy co-workers. If a guest complains about something even if you explained whatever to them before they ordered, if if nothing was wrong they were just looking for a free meal, the managers always comped bills to avoid customer confrontation. So, you get these jerks back that always complain and don't tip because they know they are going to get a free meal. Schedules are crazy, usually inconsistant, you have to work doubles 10-12 hour shift just make it by. Management is great, but definelty not a job for someone trying to provide for a family. You never know what you are going to make, espcially during slow times. The workplace culture was great, everybody is like a big family and really care about each other. But, they are not very good at punishing employees for being late, being on their phones, calling out all the time, and just being lazy. If you are someone who always does their job to the best of your ability your co-workers will peeve you off, but thats any job."
good,"En general es un buen lugar para trabajar,en algunas ocasiones el personal que se contrata no tiene el entrenamiento adecuado."
good,Chili's was definitely a great learning experience. Most of the management team was pretty good. My lunch andate breaks were often overlooked an I did go a few time without one. Buthe over all its an okay place to work.
good,Overall the job is alright but I feel as though I can find a better opportunity to get paid more and do it in an environment that isn't as bad. Chilis is just too understaffed.
good,This was a fast paced experience.  Fun to work as a part of a crew that puts out as much food as this place does.  Work late into the night and weekends.
good,I enjoyed the 10 years I worked for this company. The staff was great the customers were great for the most part. It was just a fun place to work. I would recommend it
good,"Working at chili's can have its perks. They work with your personal schedule, you can choose days or nights, so for the most part its a flexible job. A typical day at work will eventually turn into being supper busy. You have to be able to multi-task and be fast. You learn that patients is a virtue. The culture for most chili's is team service and also taking care of guest first."
good,"Chilli's is was a fun place to work when it wasn't busy more or less when it was busy it was really stressful. a lot of dishes and a lot of work. its extremely hard to manage a social life when you get home late at night every night you work. management would not really help and teach you very well they put you in the dish tank without very much training, and ask you a lot while still maintain to be able to close the dish-tank at a good time."
good,"This is a great company with a bright future. Chili's offers some great opportunities to develop to an extent. Just as in many mid-level management jobs, you always need to be watching out for your own future."
good,It is a great way to maintain a balance between school and lifestyle working with this company. Even though compensation is not always guaranteed effort is the driving force establishing how much you want to achieve.
good,"ITs a great place to work at for an in between job or for the summer, but after a while it becomes tolling. Customers come to you and complain about other workers and disorganization is there but not massive."
good,"Working here you have to be able to multi-task because it is a lot to handle.  I wouldn't suggest this for someone's first job.  The pay is okay, it just depends on how generous your hiring manager is."
good,Chili's is the toughest place I ever worked at. If you can tough it out it will diffenently teach you a lot about the resturant business. It you can make it at chili's you can make it anywhere.
good,I love the atmosphere. Enjoy working on the Line and worked with some pretty good people.  Very short staffed and under paid.  Worked on my own with out the adequate help to run the kitchen.  However it challenged me in many ways and made me to deal with working under pressure. Gained skill in managing from independently working and to use my problem solving skills when needed.
good,"I would be working here still if management liked and treated all the crew members the same.Over all it a good place to work, meet good people, and good jod stability if management likes you."
good,"Good food, nice people, not a bad place to serve/host if you're looking to do so. Dishwashers make more than half the people there though. Kitchen people are nice too"
good,Rules aren't enforced the same way throughout stores or between co workers from the same store.The way the restaurant is we are all a family but on the other hand we usually go through employees like water.
good,"being a server at chillis is not so bad. You have to multitask, be fast and accurate about what your doing. I great the table, ask what I could get for them, make sure their food is correct and cash them out in the end."
good,Chili's has brought their brand back to life with quality food and good leadership. Free meal every shift and good discount when not working. Loved every second of it
good,chilis was a family vibe place to work with team service being the code they live by. Since leaving chilis i have missed the environment but i left because the pay was not enough and i don't regret that choice
good,"I've learn so many things in chillis, work, experience in life and i meet new friend  as well.Its a truly greatful that i got a experience in a Chilis . I would like to thanks my manager and the rest of the staff. thank you for two years,"
good,"The management is not very well. Its not their fault though, corporate sets a lot of unreachable goals which puts to much pressure on them to be effective. The people i worked with were fun and usually went out together and stuck together."
good,"A typical day involved taking and preparing take-out orders, cashing customers out when they come to pick it up, and doing sidework. I loved my coworkers and my management personnel. The culture was upbeat and fast paced"
good,Managers very reasonable if you have personal problems in your life and are willing to work with you.They have a good working environment they make you want to strive at being your best by making it a competition while you work out of everything.
good,"Not a bad job, money was great at high volume store. Management, so, so. Great team environment. Learned great service skills"
good,"Good place to start as a server."
good,"This is a good job to start with, but the money is not consistant. No a job I would use to pay the bills. The people working there are very nice and fun. The managers are good. But the device middle used here is taking money away from the employed and is not benifical to them but only to the store"
good,A great job especially if you are a people person. Depending on the location can be pretty lucrative as well. Most regions have annual softball or soccer tournaments between restaurants that are fun and competitive.
good,The Gerneral Manager was terrible. Servers with doubles had no breaks. Serving food while being hungry ain't the way to go. And the scheduling was horrible. It's some of the reasons I was Happy to go.  Just saying Happy employees equals happy customer.
good,"Chili's is great. Just not for me anymore. I have been with the company for 2 years and have nit been moved up to closing position or cocktail. Which, majority of the time, makes the most money"
good,I loved the customers in this job. Lots of regulars that made our job as serving fun. This job help me to be able to multitask very well.
good,"Always doing something whether it be cleaning or seating or delivering food to customers. Management always kept you busy. Hardest part of the job was telling people there is a wait and then having to constantly check for tables about to leave and quickly clean them off, and make sure the table is dry and not sticky for the next customers."
good,Muy buen ambiente en cuanto a compañeros de trabajo y clientes.
good,"Pretty good place to work for a short duration but doesn't really help progress your career. Best you get for upgrading is server, which is almost exact same pay then after a year or so you can become a manager which is still only around $15 per hour"
good,"Being a server was great because you were usually working on your own and everyone trusted you to be doing great work, not to mention the cash in pocket at the end of the shift. The only downside here was management was awful and would rarely listen to requests of the employees, regularly giving shifts on requested days off then saying ""it's not my problem, find someone to work your shift or pay the consequence of not coming in"". However it was fun to work there as the atmosphere was always fun and everyone knew that nothing serious was on the line as long as you could do your job well."
good,the facilities at accommodation may not be as what i expected but it's fine. but at work i am dealing with different kind of nationalities thus it may be tough for sometimes. because some staff are hard to handle and they don't like to be taught. that's challenging though.
good,"Managers treat employees well, they work with school schedules and they demonstrate care for their employees. High stress, fast paced environment."
good,Working in this industry can be fun and a little crazy. Management and co-workers are supportive and work together as a team. It is a fast pace environment that requires a high energy level. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to make the money you want to make. You have to be self motivated.
good,"The management was unorganized, but all in all it is a good company to work for. Advancement opportunities were slow, and the kitchen staff were lazy."
good,Most of the co workers are amazing and friendly. The managers use to be great but they changed 4 managers in the matter of 2 months. I found them to be immature and they let the bar and a few other places run out of what they needed.
good,"Es una empresa muy grande, sin embargo, como cualquier tipo de empresa de índole restaurantero, los sueldos son bajos para los empleados, no dan utilidades aún cuando a la hora de la renuncia te menciona que si las dan, al menos hablo en mi experiencia al decir que hay batante favoritismo y se tiende a confundir la amistad ""laboral"" con la ""relación"" laboral, entre otras cosas, si quieres tener un empleo seguro, es un buen lugar, sin embargo el crecimiento laboral es muy pobre."
good,"A lot of change, and very often. Unobtainable goals. Great management, but they are usually overworked."
good,Lo qu mas me gusto en el trabajo que algunos me enseñaron a crecer  siempre seguir con mis logros
good,"Working for Chilis was fun for the first year, but after three years it got to me, most people were too dramatic and young, being a place where you didn't need experience to start working a lot of the servers were bad. but im happy i got to learn."
good,".I work as Line Cook in the grill station mostly at night shift."
good,"Great customers, seat customers"
good,"Not one of my favorites, Long days low pay,learn a lot from being thrown in the fire. High Volume, poor benefits, Poor Management but great co workers."
good,Chili's was a great place to interact with customers face to face.
good,"A great starter job for college and great place to work but it had its problems.  management micromanaged, couldn't tell the line of a boos to a friend, and could be over worked if the managers felt it was 'needed"". However, made great friends at Chili's and met my wife there as well."
good,"Chili's is a very competitive company and with that they are always implementing new food, and ideas. That being said you will work hard, to hit the plan you will have to work on the line, wash dishes, prep, whatever it takes and it does take a toll and will burn you out as well as the team. I have managed at this company for over 5 yrs. and been a restaurant manager for 14 years, this is by far the most intense job. Its all about productivity, but often at a cost of looking at people like machines."
good,"A typical day of work involved working directly with guest and giving great service to our guests. Also, my co workers were awesome to work with as well as management. I loved communicating directly with guests and would consider that my favorite part of the job. I learned how to handle several situations at the same time for that my  multi tasking skills have grown. Overall, my experience with Chili's was great."
good,"Work usually is ridiculous but it's to be expected from a workplace that is constantly understaffed. Out of the 4 managers that work at this location, only one is worth of the position. The hardest part of this job is dealing with the managers and the place being understaffed. The only redeeming part of this job is the people that I get to spend time with. I'm not sure if it's the same with every Chili's location but this one is quite undesirable"
good,"Rolled up forks,knives, in napkins and secured with a paper ring.  Relaxing job and I enjoyed the management team as well as my co-workers."
good,I really enjoyed job. It was a great start point back in to the custmorer industry.
good,We had to navigate a tough industry on a day to day basis.  The culture that was built was fantastic and had many positives!
good,"This job was well-paying and rewarding. However, the management was unstable and therefore provided a lot of unnecessary stress and confusion."
good,"Chilis wasnt a fun place to work at. The management never worked together, and coworkers would trash talk everyone. The pay was barely adequate for the work that they required."
good,Customer/guest interaction. Extensive management training. 12 hour work days.
good,"I enjoy the Interaction with guests, I enjoy staying  busy and always having something to do"
good,"A typical work day consists of greeting and seating guests.  Telling them about new, limited time items that are being offered.  Answering  the phone and assisting the guest's with questions and concerns.  I take orders via the phone and enter them into the computer.  When the orders are ready, I look them over to make sure they are made correctly, and to order, and then give them to the guest.  I process payments through the POS."
good,"Working at Chili's has payed my housing bills and kept me busy through my years in college. It was a good learning experience in that it showed me that those with service jobs deserve credit for what they do. It was a dirty, menial job, but it provided me with a flexible schedule that I needed to still be a full time student."
good,I love getting to know guests and teaching team members how to better take care of guests and still have fun
good,Lousy and negative. I learned to never waste my time at such a low graded restaurant. The management was very rude and unkind. Co workers were also very rude and disrespectful and no one wanted to work as a team. Hardest part was to be polite to very inconsiderate co workers. The enjoyable part was to enteract with our guests!
good,"Day to day new experiences, opportunities, and stories arise from the adverse clientele we get at Chili's.  Being my first serving job, i have learned a lot when it comes to delivering bad news to entertaining guests in which to pass the time. But you can't please everyone. The toughest part of the job is dealing with the type of people who just come out to con the great, hardworking people at chili's into getting a free meal. On the other hand, i get to work with some of my best friends."
good,"Typical corporate restaurant! Management was always willing to help out and work with you to meet their needs, your needs and the customers needs."
good,"As a Server my responsibility were focused on providing a fine dining experience to all our clients, from great customer service to sales. I handled cash, card, and check transactions on a daily basis, had to make sure that all my transactions were closed before the end of the day and my tips were logged. My area had to always be clean, bus my own tables and get them ready as soon as possible for the next clients. I had to work the TO GO section were we would take incoming calls for people who wanted to place a to go order. Sometimes we also had to host depending on how busy the restaurant would get."
good,I would work morning bar so I was responisble to set up and order all items we needed to get thru the week. I learned to manage my time better and order and keep inventory of Liquor and beer. I feel as if a lot was expected of me but I am always willing to step in a help. Most of the management is willing to step in and help and some employees. The coworkers change alot they have a high turn over. the hardest part of the day was the beginning. i was responsible for a few jobs other than my own. I loved interacting with the coworkers and guests. It made my job fun
good,"I had fun at this job too, but the only thing that I didn't like was the fact that they seemed to have had to many managers and a very big lack of communiation between them."
good,"Sarting with the supervisor, they think they can put the blame to who ever they want and save the friends."
good,"Staff was great, had a lot of fun and met a ton of great people. Standard drawbacks of the corporate restaurant environment:"
good,it was a fun place to work and easy to make a quick couple hundred a night but was a drag with some of the people that worked there were not always the most fun to be around
good,Tending bar for me is a fun and easy job to have. Typical day consisted mostly of taking care of guests and tending to all bar duties.
good,This was an extremely fun environment. Faced paced. Exciting to be at. Money was excellent. Moved up quickly in positions.
good,Making sure all the customer get taking care of in a timely manner.
good,"Young team with lots of college students, team member turnover very high"
good,A normal day at work consisted of the basic essential functiond of a resturant. We preped the building to make sure there was an edible enviorment for customer to enjoy.Eventually people cam in to dine. We would serve food to the highest quality of concern care and compassion to make their stay as homely as possible.My co-workers and i enjoyed each others company as we all came for the same reasons. Which were to make money and provide excellent service.
good,chilis is a good place to work pay could be better food is good and benifits are ok
good,"All restaurants can be summarized the same. The culture is the same in most places, but at Brinker they try to balance caring for the employees and putting shareholders first. The management is great because most of them start from the bottom and become partners. Hard work pays off. Limited advancement."
good,Typical workday was serving customer's
good,"Pros:"
good,"In an attempt to stay relevant, Chili's changed the entire culture of the brand and focused on keeping profits up and shareholders happy.  This involved labour cutbacks and more hourly functions being covered by salaried managers."
good,"I have loved my time at Chili's over the past 5 years, but I can't wait to explore other options once I graduate from college. The management was great when I first started, but I can't say the same anymore. This seems to be a theme across all the Chili's in the Middle Tennessee area."
good,Ok place to work if you actually work and close every night. If you are a strong server the money is decent but you have to close to make it. Also have too bus you own tables and host too
good,"It’s really good money once you make it to the good sections, but your entire schedule is based on surveys on those ziosks they have. I’ve seen plenty of people fired for a survey."
good,"Loved my coworkers. Hated the excessive tipping out. Loved hot schedules allowing for swapping shifts. Clientele not the greatest, cheap. Too many menu changes and cheap specials. Hard to make good tips when a family of four and eat 3 course meal for 10 dollars each. Good for kids."
good,"tips are awful, bad location. management sucks, workers are cool. the managers dont want to work with you but expect you to be there at the drop of a dime."
good,It was all cool until a new general manager came. She was very demanding disrespectful towards everybody a little prejudice. But I got to eat a free meal every night that I worked. People didn’t work as a team how they should in a restaurant industry but I had to do what I had to do at the time.
good,"money is good for what it is . This is not good long term, and the lunch shifts are truly hit or miss ; they go through periods of turn over but staff is mainly ok"
good,"Chili's is a nice place and there is room to advance, however, the money you take home (as a server) is not good at all compared to other restaurants. Management is nice and helpful, although they can tend to focus on the guests more than their employees."
good,"Chili's is a work place where you can relax & have fun. However, you have to deal with servers yelling at you at times which can make it very stressful. You get paid every two weeks & you make like 100-200 . Which is not much for two weeks.  Other than that the manager is fun & you have fun , laid back ,but no money..."
good,Working at Chilis taught me how to interact with people and how to handle stressful situations in a professional manner. It also teaches you how to multi- task and to get things done in a timely manner.
good,its a great place to work if you know what your walking into. its  a growing store with a great general manager. great place to make money if you have the skills
good,It was an overall good experience and it was  good start in learning what it would be like to work in a restaurant. Th people there were really friendly and helping.
good,"Lack of control, or knowledge of day to day runnings by upper managment. Staff is required to do other jobs to save with labor. Communication from upper management could be better."
good,"I've been an employee for 5 years and the past two years have been so horrible. Don't get me wrong, I have a great management team who I love, but as far as corporate, well, I'm not liking their new ways. Work used to be fun and about making the guest happy, now it's about working fast and making the guest happy. But now it's impossible to even make some kind of connection with the guest because we're constantly running around the restaurant."
good,"I loved working at chili’s in pine bluff, at BEFORE they got this new manager. At one point I never would have stopped working for them, but once the new management came, I had to find another job."
good,"I enjoyed working for chilis, the only thing i did not like about this job is all the cleaning and the work was too fast paced and stressful at times,"
good,"Managers varied. Some cared, some didn’t and it was obvious to the employees. My coworkers became my close friends. Would work long hours sometimes on a school night which I told them I couldn’t do but continued to do it."
good,"they do not the best management, the work days where hard and long hours, you were used n mistreated by other staff members and some management. did not care about safety n regulations"
good,working at chilis can be really stressful due to how busy it gets and the servers not caring. there are fun aspects of working there like dealing with the customers
good,"The hardest part of the job is when there is a rush, but we are lacking employees. There are no bussers or food runners, so servers are working harder."
good,"Working as the host at the front, I would often run into difficult interactions with customers. Did my best to seat them as quickly and efficiently as I could. During rush hours, it can get super crazy nuts sometimes. Especially on holidays. Management at my location was awesome and love their co-workers. Most co-workers were also super friendly. Servers were hard to make friends with as they were constantly running around with little to not time to talk. Overall, a positive first job experience. It can be very rewarding if you're good at working with a team or good at customer service."
good,"I have not worked for chili's foe awhile so any review of management, workplace culture ect... will not be relevant.  The food was very good but that's all I will say."
good,"Good culture. I enjoyed how that culture cultivated myself and others to pursue goals we had for our restaurant. Unfortunately, working 65 to 70 hours a week took a toll on my psyche and personal life."
good,"Good place to work for. It's always busy, and there is room for advancement within the company of you're willing to work hard and not be afraid of long hours, and working a little extra."
good,Get to know new people from all around the world with positive vibes. Managed to learn many things from them especially from my working colleagues. Get to know how does F&B operate.
good,"I've worked at two Chili's locations and the first was terrible, management was irresponsible and I was underpaid. The second location was a completely different story, I loved it."
good,"I moved up in the company fast, but the pay wasn't very good. Area managers were there very often, stressing out the other mangers, making for an uneasy work enviroment."
good,got the experience i needed with the work  environment i know i couldn't make a career there but its not a bad job for someone starting out in the work field
good,Managers are very helpful. Chilis is a good place to work at. Quick and easy shifts and good money making shifts. The staff is very friendly and willing to help you out with any problem.
good,"chilis is a different type of job, the atmosphere is quite different from any other.there are many improvements that should be done to this work enviorment."
good,"Chili's provided an easy environment to make money, but unfortunately the management at the Valdosta, GA Chili's was terrible. We went through three general managers during my time there, and two of them were lazy and very biased towards employees."
good,Loved working here most of the time due to fast paced environment and the relationships built with coworkers. We were one big family. However management did tend to show favoritism.
good,"Empresa con una gran calidad humana, los empleados son personas con ganas y amor por lo que hacen. Se me dio la oportunidad de crecer laboralmente e ir escalando hasta llegar a ocupar uno de los cargos mas importantes en la empresa, adicional se me dio la oportunidad de administrar un punto en la ciudad de cartagena."
good,Based on restaurant locations varied as far as a typical day. Sometimes employee call outs made daily execution more complicated because of shortages in areas and high volumes of Guests. Management development was not consistent due to time constraints so it felt at times that you were getting no where ahead but just staying even on daily and weekly routines.
good,"the most enjoyable part of the job is the team service.  My coworkers made going to work enjoyable.  Everyone helps everyone, it may be a busy restaurant but no stone goes un turned when using team service."
good,"Management lacks ability to enforce equal work from all employees; extra sidewalk for those that work hard, no real incentive to work hard as hours are not based on performance"
good,"i enjoyed the people i worked with. the management was average."
good,"If the upper management in the Chilis corporation could open their eyes to more than just their redundant requirements of management, the restaurant would have a chance to run successfully. As it is now the management turn over is so high that the employees never have a chance to feel settled in. They have forced out or displaced two great GMs in the past year and a half."
good,"Good with people , reliable and capable to ensure the safety of others and surrounding peers. Motivated on moving forward, friendly and a hard worker willing to complete tasks. High energy to be able to collaborate with one another."
good,It was super intense. Worked with a lot of amazing operators in a very competitive environment. Experienced a lot of personal and professional growth during my time there. Work life balance was not the best.
good,"Provide customer service including answering the phone, greeting customers and sitting them. Organize stand, clean tables, sweep floors and fill out paperwork."
good,"Served people that came in to eat"
good,Fast paced work environment that takes a casual spin on things. Family restaurant with bar. I learned how to ne an amazing server at this job due to high volume and workloads spread through the front of house employees.
good,"it was overall a good experience and the other co workers were nice and friendly. everyone saw eye to eye with each other so it helped bring everyone closer, I learned that you cant always do things on your own. management was a friendly environment and experience as well"
good,easy to flip tables. learned to always have a smile no matter what. management easy to get a long with. Always good energy never a dull moment. best part was the teamwork. everyone was always willing to help.
good,A good stepping stone job as a host. Servers are making the most money. Especially on weekends. Don't be afraid to speak up and get the respect you deserve.
good,fun to work there but high turn over rate as most restaurants so can be hard to get along with everyone. the manager at mine was not a very nice person. they don't make you feel important they make you feel expendable.
good,"I worked for Chili's in college, and it was a great way to start my career in customer service. The environment is fast paced, which is great if you're looking to make money (on tips)"
good,"One of my favorite jobs but the job was more demanding than it should've been because management was never on the same page. I was able however to have three promotions. Started from a host, to To-Go, to QA, to server."
good,"Old unit in bad shape when I took over, turned the place around and got the facility cleaned and running well. Was moved to quick service where I ran into the same mess and turned it around as well,"
good,"I enjoy working here, however, the structure could be better. It is a relaxed management style.  A bit too relaxed for myself.  I thrive and pride myself in consistency.  I feel sidework and proper stocking provides for a better shift for our team, as well as, our guests. This is a new location and I feel could benefit from some adjustments.  I have been a server for years and would prefer a more structured work environment personally. It is a fun atmosphere and it's nice to have benefits!"
good,"Overall, my experience at Chili's was sub-par. My co-workers were really fun and the managers were mostly friendly. One issue I found is that the location I worked at had four different managers. Sometimes, this caused issues with communication because one manager will tell you one thing and one will tell you another. Also, sometimes co-workers would slack on bussing tables, causing a back-up in me seating people. Experiences are likely different across the nation, but I would not return to the location I previously worked at."
good,This was a good job that I had for quite a few years. The staff was great management was pretty cool and we served good product.  Usually pretty steady days with all kinds of different jobs to do
good,"Chili's was a really fun place to work and everyone there seems to get along amazingly. While sometimes management was hard to find and talk to, due to understaffing, they always tried to make as much time for their team as possible so they could help you solve any problems or answer any questions you may have. The kitchens are full of amazing hard working people who know how to make it a really fun shift and the time flies by."
good,they try to make it fun but if you don't have the right team it can bring you down the company as a hole tries very hard to make it a fun place to work they have great incentives for  team members and management
good,"A typical day at work included, coming in and setting up your station for the night. working side by side with your peers with great communication to smoothly run the shift. clean up after yourself. and working with your peers to clean the restaurant for the morning crew the next day"
good,Management was very nice although co-workers could have been more focused. The job was ideal for me and my being pregnant. Managers always made sure that I was okay to work.
good,"Excelente grupo de trabajo, muy responsables,compañeristas y un gran ambiente laboral."
good,I enjoyed all the people that I worked with and the managers where very easy going.  It was a fun place to work.  Every day was different nd that's what I enjoyed most.
good,"encouraging and hardworking management, positive atmosphere, co-workers who work with you in your section to help benefit everyone, most enjoyable part is when everyone works together to keep customers happy and make sure the restaurant runs effectively"
good,"When I was 16 is when I first started to work at Chili's. At this time it was like we were all a big family, we all worked together, helped each other out and had fun while we were doing it. As time progressed, it seemed to go downhill. When I was 18, I became a server and bartender, I was supposed to leave and go away to college, but my plans changed and I ended up staying and working there while I was in school. This is when I really noticed things going downhill. Employees weren't working together anymore, managers weren't helping out. It was basically everyone fends for themselves which was not something that I was happy to be a part of and was one of the big reasons I chose to leave."
good,"I had a lot of fun working at Chili's, but almost all of the employees there hated their job and it eventually became a job I dreaded because of that. The management had some good days, but they never seemed to have everyone in mind, they were always focused on one specific thing versus the restaurant as a whole. I felt under-appreciated and taken advantage of quite frequently. I would have liked to have been thanked for going above and beyond in situations I shouldn't have had to deal with in the first place."
good,at my time working for Forever21 was an okay experience.it was my first job in retail and I was egar to learn more about that field. but when they became a popular store they made some store changes I didn't agree with
good,Be smart follow the guidelines at the workplace work as hard as you can   within the guidelines an use your working skills to become great at your job.
good,"A typical day at work includes opening duties, greeting and seating guests, cleaning tables after the guests left, and also wishing them a good day. "
good,"When I come into work the first thing I do is detail the table in my zone.  I then make sure to set the team up for success by restoring cups, ice, beverages, ect.  At Chilis, not only amy I a server but I'm a Busser, Food Runner, Expo, and sometimes Host. Not because I was scheduled for that position, but because we do not simply have those positions for the most part.  We only have an Expo and a Host during high volume times, and as of the other positions, we don't have any Food Runner or Bussers.  Working for chilis has actually taught me to work more efficient and detailed because we all clean our own tables, run our own food/drinks, and seat tables.  I enjoy working for Chili's because I can take the things I have learned about being more efficient to my other experiences in the future."
good,"Estar laborando en esta empresa te llena de experiencia en cuanto al servicio al cliente, la gerencia no es como esperaba el nivel de madurez es bajo, mis compañeros son las personas mas humildes que he conocido ademas son respetuosos y amigables."
good,Normal waitress job. pretty much what you would expect for being a waiter/waitress. The staff and other waitress can really start to feel like family thou. Tips can be bad some days and good the others.
good,"In Florida, a typical work day can last 8-13 hours. Work environment is laid back but can get hectic. The most difficult part of the job is dealing with unprofessionalism. The most enjoyable part of the job is flexibility in scheduling."
good,"Great coworkers and some awesome managers, but it seemed like the good ones never stayed long. Money wasn't great, but it was an easy place to work."
good,"I was a great employee at Chili's and always went out of my way to help fellow employees and keep a less stressful night after  spending a few months as a host then became a sever things were going well my manager and mentor she showed so much belief in me i was waiting tables of 4 though 12 doing a really great job sometimes  I used to go as far as helping the kitchen and even doing dishes but when the new manger came he showed so much disbelief towards me and i went from doing tables of 4 through 12 to 1 through possibly 4,five if i was lucky but long story short i was fired cause i was stuck in a blizzard and couldn't get to work after all my hard work and efforts put in with this company other managers disagreed but it is what it is i showed no anger and just left no hard feelings and thai you to the managers who believed in me"
good,Chili's gave me great experience as a Corporate Rest. Manager but many issues within staff and discipline. Also I was the bar manager and it was mandatory the only day I could do my liquor order was on my day off.
good,I was one of the only reliable hostesses therefor my work schedule was very hard to balance with school and my competetion dance team.
good,"Not very good with hours, but the co-workers were nice. The hardest part of the job was catering to multiple people at a time."
good,"Working at Chili's was very fun and interesting, every day was something different. I would prepare meals to order in a fast paced environment."
good,I liked working here and the people i worked with were cool but the management was a little unorganized. Loved the food and serving our customers.
good,"i loved working at chilis they was very friendly they was not rude very often unless you do something wrong, you get a percentage off food and you work with very nice people"
good,"good work life balance, pay was ok, crazy work hours sometimes, worked as a manager a lot of responiblity"
good,"A typical day is getting to work, then going to get my stuff to communicate with staff, and host. I clean tables after the customer has left and wipe it down. Sometimes broom under table if they are dirty. I also have other responsibilities to take out the trash, and sweep the floors. The management is okay and nice. The hardest part of the job was the standing and never having a break."
good,"had good food for my employee meal, lol  things were done in an organized manner. I learned some about food management. fun coworkers who helped each other. the hardest part was a lack of pay. t"
good,"This is a great place to make enough money to manage bills while in school. Although if you are not in school and looking for good pay to help keep up with all bills and costs of living I suggest you really spend time to make as many tips as possible by taking more tables than needed during your entire shift, come early, stay late, and pick up other workers shifts."
good,"Good money for short amount of work hours.  Team environment is very supportive and co workers provide help when needed.  Management team is very supportive, understanding, and willing to work with your schedule if you are a student or have other obligations."
good,I have learned about fajitas and how to make them guacamole. Can make great salads set up plates to their ordered
good,"Fun place, great place, work hard, exceptional pay, great customers."
good,"I worked for Chili's in the past for a year and a half. Yes there are great opportunities for advancement, but the atmosphere (at least in at my location) was not the best. Half the managers were always irritable, I had to deal with a lot of harassment, and there was always a lot of gossip and back-talk between coworkers. I was so happy to leave this place. The only thing I miss? The tips!"
good,"Overall, I enjoyed my time working at chilis. It was great money for a college student such as myself and if not for Chilis and the money I made I would not have been able to attend college. I made sure all of my guests had a unique dining experience and making Chilis their number one choice for a bar and grille. The hardest part of my job was learning to work for a corporation and realizing how it operates. Working for Brinker Nation and their choice in management has prepared me for the corporate world and what it will expect from me."
good,Chili's is an overall great company to work for with room to grow.  It was the first place that I ever worked for that took the time to listen to the people that work for them and improve their experience.
good,Couldn't ask for a better staff of employees than one's I worked with at Chili's. Everyone was willing to help or cover a shift whenever you asked.  Managers were even willing to excuse your absence if in case of an emergency. The job itself was fairly easy.  You greet guests with an enthusiastic 'Hello' and direct them to a table of their liking.  On weekends it became difficult however due to constant traffic and disgruntled guests.
good,I worked every holiday while the General Manager that was supposed to rotate holidays took them all off. My team members were hard working individuals. The hours were long and I would often have to come in on my days off for inventory for 4+ hours.
good,"-Seat customers at there tables, wipe tables and menu's. Assists servers with customers. "
good,I started as a server and worked my way up into management. Chilis is a great place to work
good,"busy and productive, fun atmosphere, unstable hours. coworkers are great people. Hardest part of the job is the fast paced of it. Most enjoyble part is working as a team."
good,"A typical day at work consists of me making sure all the soups are filled and heated to the right temperature. It consists of me getting together a list of things we are currently out of for that day or running low on and from there I can deduce what options to take to rectify the situation. I am the medium between the both sides of the restaurant, The cooks and everyone that is not. I am responsible for sending food out in a quick, presentable, and timely fashion."
good,"Each day I come in, the things I do are clean the windows, menus, restock crayons and maintain the door. I open the door for customers coming in and leaving. Always to have a smile, greet them, or thank them for coming in. I have learned how the front end of a restaurant is run and gained some knowledge of the back of the house. Management there isn't exactly my favorite. My co-workers are like my family, we all get along well.  I enjoy everything about my job, there isn't a part that is too hard for me or that I dislike."
good,"Prep the food needed for the par for the day. Wash dishes as the they pile up. Clean tables, as they get dirty. Keep the people happy. Management and workers are friendly. Having to multitask is very demanding. Contests during work make it fun."
good,Scheduling of shifts was easily accomplished when keeping open communication with management.  Last minute changes due to school or life events usually handled easily with the online hotschedules.com program which allowed others to pick up your shift or you to pick up a shift when needed.  I love serving and bartending especially when I have time to get to know my customers and make them feel their visit was special. 
good,"-A typical day at work would usually start between 3:30 and 5:30 pm. The day starts by overseeing the daytime employees, and makig sure that the night crew is set up for success. Make drinks for both bar guests and service bar. Make guests feel comfortable, welcomed and valued was a must. Taking orders, guiding guests towards particular items and upselling was an important part of my job. I would also run food, help other bartenders or servers when needed and finish my closing duties before getting checked out by the manager on duty."
good,Chili's is a good starter job in certain cases. I learned how to jump between different stations while we were short on staff or had to go between restocking my station(s) and then continuing to go about making food as ordered. My coworkers were characters but all around good people. Some of the managers were just not fit to be managers but others did their job well and actually helped out during the times where they actually needed to do their job. Hardest part of the job had to be waiting for the kitchen to close because if people were still inside after we closed then we couldn't close the kitchen. Easiest was right after lunch where one could stock their stations in peace.
good,A typical day at work consisted of fast paced energetic processes. Preparing the kitchen and restaurant for a full day of business. Task and time management were extremely important. Being a team player at Chili's is a huge part of your job. It helps to keep the kitchen and serving space friendly and productive. I learned many time management skills to get things done quicker and more efficiently. I learned conflict resolution skills between employees and management. Chili's was also very diligent about customer relations and respectful memorable service. Management at this particular Chili's location was one of the best in the phoenix area. The hardest part of the job for me was keeping a highly energetic positive impression in the kitchen 100% of the time in a 40-hour week. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was the customers and the relationships I formed with them over time.
good,I get there start off by washing dishes that were left from the afternoon shift then i would go over to th cook station and cook for the rest of the night.
good,"I really enjoyed working here. The only downside to this job was the clientele who came in, but it was just apart of the area i suppose."
good,"a typical day includes cooking food and dealing with servers while keeping a fast pace without lacking quality. I have learned how to work with others and help others out without being asked and paying attention to details/quality while keeping a quick work pace. Management can lax on some of their duties but at other times will be ahead. Co-workers are nice as far as in the kitchen, can joke around and have fun while still being at work. Server co-workers are typically needy and complain a lot. The hardest part of the job is doing 14 hour shifts with only one meal and one short break."
good,Typical serving job while I was getting through school. The management was really helpful and always addressed problems immediately. They also gave great training that prepared a person to serve the public
good,"It is just a typical restaurant, long hours and short breaks."
good,"well a day at chilli's was fast fun and challenging , 20 min ticket times and a made to order system. i learned how to cook. management was nice, fun and high energy. co-workers wanted it done yesterday. mulittasking was hard to do when orders start to pile up."
good,great group of coworkers.athe hardest part was keeping up with the high volume of orders.the management was good
good,"All staff is very friendly and helpful. Everyone got along great with each other. Management for the most part was good. It was a hit or miss at that location, either it was very busy or very slow."
good,Short term the company is not bad. Benefits are below average. Vacations do not exist. Only stay in for the long term if you want to get into management. Managers get paid nicely and have vacations. Hours are long though for managers and don't have much control because they have to follow a strict corp. procedures.
good,It was a fast paced company that greatly initialized my skills and abilities. The pay was good and the hours were fair. The environment is settle just make sure you’re organized.
good,"I""ve been with Chili's for 10 years it is a very growth-oriented company with awesome cultural beliefs. Chili's also has a very family-oriented environment."
good,"... a bottom line driven establishment is not conducive to taking the time it takes to delight guests. It's a turn em and burn em atmosphere and you are 100% judged by your incrimentals and how fast iu you can clock out, rather than did you do your duties well."
good,It is what it is... I like working only and that was the best benefits for me had help but work was work. I learned you in it to win not for anyone else but you
good,"It doesn't close too late, so I'm always out by 11 or earlier. The other servers are really easy to work with and trading shifts/requesting off is super easy. All scheduling is done online. There are currently too many servers so the weekly hours are not up to satisfaction for most. Some changes in management are in place."
good,"Always busy and very fast pace, they have a good team work especially with the manager and made sure everything was going smooth, always happiness and joy"
good,its nice to work there with good colleagues but moderate management. but good food to eat everyday. i meant the staff meal and also the medical treatment that they will give for free. its really nice of it.
good,"It depends on who is working at the establishment. Some days life is good and some days their bad. You work hard all day and you may do 4 different jobs in one day."
good,"Chili's is a good place to work if you need a job on the side or a little extra cash. Sometimes management can be difficult, and the job can also be stressful at times, but it's relatively easy."
good,"I personally don’t get enough hours at chili’s, there is also new management that are hurting the store more than helping it. My shifts are only three to four hours long, I only work roughly 16 hours a week and that’s not enough"
good,None be you. Show up neat clean and focused on performing at your Highest level to send out  exceptional food. To a high demanding environment. All in all a good work ethic will help you advance and keep a steady paycheck.
good,Flexible hours and fairly liberal company. Management is pretty consistent and will to help. Its is fast paced however and can get stressful. Not for the weak hearted
good,My experience has been great with Chili's. It is a 50 hour work week salary based position with great benefits and culture. There is adequate support provided from director of operations to improve management development.
good,Management at the time always took care of employees. Made sure they were knowledgable on how to so their job and take care of guests. Always planned fun events to get everyone involved.
good,"Was a great place to work when I first started there, the managers were a little unorganized but made the job fun. The most recent gm was not good he picked favorites and ended up getting in trouble with HR for other reasons."
good,It’s a fun job to have if you’re in high school or middle maybe. It was my first time at a restaurant so I really didn’t know what was my pay until I received my paycheck and I was making $4/hr.
good,"Chili's is nice for if you need to make quick money, however theres a lack of benefits for working there. not only that, but people tend to burn out quick due to how quick paced and overwhelming it can be."
good,"you learn how to get used to a fast paced environment, but some times people stress you or the pressure of selling certain things gets you stressed. You need to meet a cuota of a sale per hour, if not management will talk to you to seek more opportunities that you may be missing."
good,"It was great working there, but the employees there really sucked. An employee touched me inappropriately. Management did not do anything about it. Other than that, I loved working there because I had a lot of freedom."
good,Not much to say it’s a fun place . Management will work with you on your schedule. The employees are fun to be around but just like every restaurant there are nights the place feels like it will burn down lol
good,Every day is full of fun a lot of people smiling and all the staff have a nice relation even the managers if i given another chance to work with them i will grab i learn a lot of things there about the kitchen mechanics and in the floor the hardest part of the job is when we working on a rush our and only a few staff is available it brings some circumstance thats not fair to the guest and the enjoyable part of this job is when theres a birthday by the guest or staff they celebrate and everyone is participating on the event doing somethings that makes things special in un-expected way
good,"Was absolutely the worst training that I had ever attended. Was sent to training restaurant and basically washed dishes and cooked for 3 months.  Since I had experience but no oversight or given direction, I just went to work. When I arrived at my home location, I was older and more experienced than the other managers who had all started as servers just like me, only they stayed at the same restaurant that they had started in."
good,"A great way to interact with the community and costumers. Most of the management was professional. When it was one of our busier days, we worked together and had a good work ethic that made us good at what were doing, making sure costumers were satisfied with the environment and food."
good,"Se trata de darle un buen servicio al consumidor, que tengan una buena experiencia, llevarle los platos o lo que el nos diga en el pedido, cobrarle cuando termine de comer y cobrar el pedido."
good,"Chilis is the first job in Calgary last 2009, this company hired me from the Philippines. They encourage me to work with and share my knowledge to my co worker regarding techniques and safety,"
good,"Entry level position that helped me established some financial freedom when I was younger. Nothing too special about the position, I would say that the work environment was pretty relaxed, but not in an unprofessional way. Having the T.V's was pretty great if you are into sports, but can be distracting, especially if they run the same channels . The music can also get a little old, as it is just a 50 song playlist of the least offensive pop songs you can imagine. If you happen to be young or going to school you will fit right in, however older people may struggle to be on their feet as long as you may have to."
good,"a good days work for a good days pay, that's all i have to say. about chili's. its a great work place if you need a good job.   my son work there , he is 20 and makes enough to cover college and car payment with no problem,"
good,I enjoy the quick pace work I like the challenge I enjoy hands on food experience when the team is on point work is great great food being served daily....
good,"great food "
good,i start young there but they let me learn from busboy to line cook and the pay me good money for what i do there the guy how work there are friendly and was a pleasure work for them
good,"The hardest part of being a hostess was seating and cleaning up after the party. When the waitresses and waiters we're behind on the job us hostess had to clean up the tables so the shift can run smoothly. Another hard part on the job is you only get a 10 minute break and everyone counts on the hostess to be in there spot at all times. They always said ""hostess make the shift"""
good,Chill's is a very good environment to work in everything and everybody is awesome it's not very hard work not that stressful and the boss was not that bad
good,it was by far an experience I will never forget. it was fun I cannot even lie but at times it gets very cutthroat and u got to hustle to get to where you need to be but overall I enjoyed it the pay was great management was great.
good,"I was told that I would have the tools to help set me up for success, when in the end I was set up to fail.  Management should and want to see their team grow and advance."
good,"Management is very team orientated! Work with your schedule, and talk about goals with company! Co-workers became great friends and partners! Loved working for this company! However if you do not keep your ITR up to par which can be very difficult, you will most likely be terminated."
good,"Great, busy environment where compensation was never an issue, but as a corporate restaurant, there are flaws and certain expectations I find to be a complete nuissance.  "
good,"Went into work ready to seat and greet people with a smile and make sure they were comfortable before being served. Management was great, they helped as needed."
good,Brinker int. is a nice company and a good way to get yourself through college Thank being said it is still a restaurant Job and comes with all the cultural trappings therein.
good,"I have worked here awhile and it is very fast paced. You have to go, go, go. If you don't you fall behind very quickly. The people are ok, although it is kinda like walking back into high school. The management does like to play favorites too."
good,"The days are either really slow or really fast, the management is iffy. I like the GM but the other managers just tend to be really mean when under stress (mostly uncalled for). The hardest part of the job is when it's really busy and the kitchen/servers need certain dishes because you have to pause whatever you're doing and get what they need, it complicates you trying to keep up with all of the other dishes. The most enjoyable part of the job is when it's a good day and everyone isn't stressed because everyones cracking jokes and having fun rather than everyone being mean and stressing out. There's one manager that you kinda gotta walk on eggshells when you're around him."
good,Handle money transactions. Made sure orders were correct before presenting to guests. Part-time dishwasher. Stock and inventory assistant. Took orders and provided amazing service
good,"nice people to work with, some brought in drama, some of the managers were had to work with and the people that came in dont tip above 15% even you did a good job with the table, been stiffed there many times"
good,"I absolutely love customer service. With this job I was able to deal personally with my customers. I miss a lot of my regulars there. I did not like that fact that we got paid every two weeks but our checks would be 0$ even if we didn't make much on tips as well as having to do a tip share with the hostess and bartenders but would have to claim those tips as well. We also never got a raise, no matter how long you work there as a server we would only get paid 2.13 an hour"
good,"Grato ambiente pero mala paga, lo especial del trabajo es la gente que llegas a conocer."
good,"Chili's is definitely a hard place to work for, but you'll get good benefits out of it if you're willing to put in the work. They believe in team serving, so while you get to keep your own tips, you are given a large section of the restaurant that you split with another coworker. It can get a little stressful at times, but your co-workers create a great family and everybody helps each other out as much as possible. Also, since you are given such large sections, you're able to make great tips."
good,"Chili's is an extremely innovative company, very interactive with changes, although lots of changes from month to month almost too much to keep up with, there was issues with keeping employees and issues with keeping managers. If the store was properly staffed at all time the experience would have been completely different. I have not written them off but I had to take a step back for my sanity."
good,"Busy around the holidays but slow rest of year. Outside of serving side duties consist of running dish, rolling silverware and running food. Management turns over too much to establish culture. Cooks in the kitchen tend to butt heads with servers"
good,Awesome atmosphere. Very cheerful & happy workers. Enjoyed the money I was able to make serving. Management I wouldn't say is 100% but getting better.
good,"Great place to make money if you can handle the customers.  If you have good people skills and can work at a fast pace, you will succeed."
good,"the coworkers where really competitive, the schedules don't let u study or do other things, but it was a great salary to be a server. hard to get permissions for anything you need."
good,"Aprendía manejar mis tiempos y a organizarme, manejar inventarios y fechass de vencimientos. Además,me enseñaron a controlar las quejas de clientes. Las personas con las que trabajé eran muy diveritdos, jóvenes, proactivos, carismáticos y les gustaba trabajar en equipo."
good,The management does not communicate well which makes it difficult to know exactly what is expected of you. they have good benefits though.
good,"I've been at this chili's for over a year now and yes although this place is fun and the people are welcoming and I've manged to develop some very great friendships, I do sometimes get tired of working here because of the lack of hours."
good,"Chili's is a nice place to work if you consider the opportunity of meeting different kind of people everyday. I can say that there are things and values that we can only hear and witness through other people. And that is one thing I consider that it is worth it working with Chili's."
good,owners not very compasionate to employees and management have sever thigns wrong with the company management is inadequate and not knowledgeable
good,I have worked for the company since I was 24 years old and have been an area director for 18 years
good,"Wasn't a bad place to work, you got free kids meals at the end of your shift. The only problem I had was that working in the kitchen was more difficult for me, not because the work was hard but because the kitchen wasn't built for a 5'1'' person. Spent quite a bit of time asking for help getting things down from the walk in or putting things in the microwave if the one at my station was already occupied and I needed to use another one."
good,Great place to get quick money but having to rely on business and people to get paid is very inconsistent.
good,I personally didn't like the high stress they put on you at this job it made it hard to enjoy the job and get it done right.
good,"It was a good place to work. Not much room for advancement. Never enough staff, but if you want a lot of hours it's a great place to work."
good,Dealing with food and hungry customers for the entire day. Management was okay.
good,Chilis was a positive and energetic place for employment. The team work and attitude of each employee was upbeat and great each and every day.
good,"Jump in and work type of place to work. You can a lot of room to advance. Management is willing to help and talk to you if there is a problem. Servers are friendly, however the line leaves much to be desired. Every man for themselves atmosphere. Spent more time prepping food than cooking due to the atmosphere. Applied for server and was told I had to work my way from the kitchen. I was the only one they told this to. More time than not I was pushed off a job by another employee because I was seen as too slow. Management refused to change my station or talk to the employee."
good,"Prep, cook, clean, and minor inventory duties. I learned how to multitask to an extreme in high volume periods. Regretfully the management wasn't as hands on in the back of the house as to be expected."
good,"A typical day at Chili's consisted of long hours and constant standing. Over all the management was decent, and the people I worked with felt like family. Money was good as well."
good,I worked at Chili's for to long but it paid the bills and got me through college.
good,La facilidades y equipo de trabajo en buenas condiciones. El trato gerencial bueno pero los gerentes no sabían hacer horarios.
good,"All the managers I worked with, even the new ones that came in, were all awesome. And I liked all my coworkers as well. Working as the bartender, I got to know the regulars, and what they drank. So when they walked in, I already had their drink made for them."
good,"I wasn’t getting the hours or pay I wanted          "
good,"The job is straight forward and easy to get a hang of. I admit, when I first started to work there, I was not use to putting in orders on tablets. In previous restaurants, I would always write it down but now, I had to learn where specific foods were in the tablet along with how to modify certain items and which items are not able to be modified. I learned that we do not have bussers, therefore the waitress have to clean their own tables. It was something to get use to as well but not hard to do."
good,"The company was decent , it had great benefits the only thing that could be better was the work and home balance butnothher than that it was a great atmosphere to work in"
good,"It was my coworkers who got me through the days of dealing with hangry customers. I had a good management team for the most part, there was only 1 manager out of 5 that I didn’t get along with"
good,"Fast pace, clear focused, motivational atmosphere. Good communication through all shifts. Team work is key, your never alone! Guest always come first, hot food before cold drinks"
good,"If you apply here, ask for as much money as you can, because thats all you're gonna get. To their credit, they do give a yearly bonus of $250. No raises, no potential for advancement"
good,If you're young and you want to make some money this is a good place to set up shop. Your base pay is 2.13 plus tips so theres no limit on overtime as long as you do a good job. often times people are happy to give up a shift. Very fast paced and fun environment if you're lucky. Half priced food is nice too.
good,"come in put on my uniform, speak and get comfortable with the night crew. Management would be up front making sure all of the customers leave happy and satisfied. The hardest thing about the job is the rush, reason being is the managers tell us to cook in portions and the rush has at least 5 per table and it gets extreme. The most enjoyable moments were getting to now the crew and having fun laid back managers."
good,Plenty of opprotunities to grow and develop yourself. Allows you to create connections with people that will last for years. Plenty of opportunities to move up.
good,"Clock In, greet customers, take orders, keep your section cleaned and maintained, If you have multiple jobs like me I was a cook and server along with a qa position you have other duties."
good,"At first it was very hard for me the atmosphere because its my first time in the food industry but after all the har work ive done i become strong team player of the restaurant, of course there is a lot bad oponions you will heard but that is the part of job. Now i have only almost 3 months in the company i learned a lot."
good,Chili's was like one big family in Edmonton and Calgary. We celebrated successes and strived for ongoing improvements. Management worked well together and were all there to support and help each other amongst all locations in our Canadian Market.They closed all street side restaurants in Edmonton and Calgary owned by Brinker Intl. It was unexpected.
good,Restaurant lifestyle. Fun environment is created by you. Strong emphasis on culture and family. DO and GM very good with helping balance life and work
good,"Business was either very fast paced or completely dead. I learned hot to work with other people, and made friends very fast there. Management was  very good, they made sure we was at work, and they were not snobby pricks. The hardest part of the job was hands down Friday nights."
good,this is a typical restaurant hours and responsibilities. but from others they tend to invest in manager development.  I worked at corporate and franchise. my franchise was the best experience. the leadership there allowed us to run the business like our own.
good,"This is a great place to work if you are in high school or about that age looking for a temporary job for a few years. I would never want a career at this place, but a lot of people that are higher up in the company did start out as servers or dishwashers and worked their way up. I say that because it is a place that is fast paced, people are very rude a lot of times, management can be fun but also moody at times, however there is an opportunity for good tip money if you are a great multitasker and are able to let peoples comments just roll off and not bother you. You have to have tough skin and a determined attitude to make any money and enjoy your time here."
good,Chili's is a great place to work for a part time or second job! It is a place to meet new employees and long time friends. Some days are laid back and some are not.
good,this is a very good company to work for high turn over place great location great food all coworkers are nice ambitious and all very hard workers cleliness
good,"Chilis is a great place to work but it could be better if management turnover wasn't so high. Change for change sake is a constant, if you dont adjust well to change then this is not for you."
good,It is a good job if your just starting to build you work history you can make a career out of it if you choose too their are great people to work with at chilis
good,"Es una buena empresa para trabajar , ya que hay cierto tipo de crecimiento laboral."
good,"Not a good job if you are looking for hours. Chilis is a slow paced restuarant. The management at chilis is amazing and the staff get along great. Working in this restuarant itself isn't bad, you just won't go anywhere with it."
good,It was a great experience working for chilis. The culture and the atmosphere were ok.  But i had to leave the company for a better opportunity that fits my still of management.
good,Loved the people I worked with and the management staff. However your ranking and shifts in the restaurant are based entirely  off of custumer reviews which can be an unreliable source and judge of your work. Brand standards are constantly changing and the work load increases every year for employees at a greater rate than pay. There is no longer flexibilty in scheduling which you would expect with a restaurant job.
good,"A typical day at work was fun and relaxing. I enjoyed serving my Customers and they enjoyed my kindness. The Culture there was pretty fair, Hardest part of the job was probably drunk customers. Most enjoyable Job was It improved my Experience as a CSR as well."
good,"tiene sus  ventajas ya  que te dan una excelente capacitación. el único defecto era la administración de la sucursal, pero dudo que sea así en todas las sucursales."
good,"chilis has a unique work environment but your day as a manager is filled with performing hourly duties.  also company has no clear vision.  can't decide what its wants to be.  fast casual or casual dining, fresh or pre-prepared.  We went through all phases in 4 years"
good,"Days are busy, some are crazy.  Management wasn't always the greatest.  I learned how to multi task during very busy shifts. enjoyed most, i made people smile."
good,"A typical day in a chili's restaurant would probably be taking orders answering the phones and serving people. I learned good customer service. The managemet was great they would lighten the mood if you were having a bad work day and they were super nice. The hardest part of the job was probably keeping up with all the orders. The most enjoyable part of the job was closing. We would play music, sing, dance, clean, stock and just do what ever needed to be done."
good,"Great company with amazing benefits and pay. The tradeoff is the quality of life. Shifts are long, I often got called on my 1 day off a week to deal with issues. Overall I enjoyed my time there."
good,Es Ambiente muy agradable y divertido me encanta por su  misión visón y pasión
good,Had a great exporence working here they were very friendly great hours hard work sometimes they get a little busier than you might expect atleast than I expected but it was worth it
good,It was an okay job. The management was not the best. Also everyone didn't know how to work as a team. That really bothered me.
good,"Management really works around ones schedule. "
good,Management did a good job in letting their employees know they are doing a good job. Very well organized and friendly employees. Kept clean and good amounts of teamwork and charm.
good,I love the fast paced environment of this restaurant. The co-workers are wonderful and the customers are great. Constant shifts in management make things trying at times.
good,"Good money, good hours that fit you. still get to have a life outside of work and be able to be with your family as well. thats all i have to say at this time. apply and find out more for yourself."
good,"I was in charge of all the training and creating new training for the store."
good,This is a great place to work! It is hard but what I found really nice about this job was they worked well with my schedule for school.
good,"Great customers, the money you make is very hard earned.. A typical day here is usually short staffed and very very stressful. Managers don't seem to care much.. hidden away in their offices you won't see them come out unless it's to deal with a customer complaint or something going wrong in the kitchen."
good,"A typical day at work for me starts around 4pm. As a server I deal with guests everyday and continue to learn new techniques to keep them happy and coming back. A method I learned as Chilis is called the LAST method-- which stands for Listen, Apologize, Solve, and Thank. We use this method to solve any all problems a guest in the restaurant may encounter. We stress working together as a team so my co-workers are very important to me. The most enjoyable part of my job would be the relationship I have with my co-workers, I have made so many friends that I will have life long. The managers always have contests and incentives to keep the morale up and the shifts running smooth. The hardest part of my job is when for whatever reason a shift isn't running smoothly and can't seem to recover."
good,I have worked for Chil's for most of my young adulthood and its safe to say they are no longer the company they once were when I first started. They stopped caring about their employees and wanted to focus solely on bringing people in and making as much money as they possibly can off the patrons. I loved my managers but that being said they had a hard time balancing being strong leaders and being your friend. Every manger had their favorites and thus every shift would bring something different. Some of the staff felt that being with the company for so long gave them immunity to doing any side work and solely focusing on their tables. There was an unfair balance of staff doing all the hard work and staff getting all the numbers and sales. I personally felt that we should be judged not by how many margaritas we could sell but how strong of a worker we are. Alas it just wasn't for me so I left while I still could.
good,A typical day at work would be a never ending flow of dishes. I learned how to dismantle and assemble a dishwasher.
good,Es un buen trabajo pero mis estudios exigen que siga adelante con una empresa que me ayude a complementar lo que estoy aprendiendo con trabajo.
good,"Great place to learn all the basics of management, have one of the best training programs ( Puerto Rico) for the employee. And give a lots of opportunity of growth in the company."
good,"If you are in high school or recently a high school graduate, I would totally recommend you working here it’s fast and easy money and the shifts are usually about 5 to 6 hours."
good,Was a really good place to work.. Co- works as well as shift Managers.. Enjoyed it very much.. would love to find another Chili's the operated this way and such. The managers made the job easy was willing to listen to any suggestions on helping the business operate and run a lot smoother..
good,While working there the atmosphere was great the people I worked with were good people to work with. I would highly recommend this job to anyone who wants to work there.
good,The work load can get to you at times especially if you're a closer but the pay is good if they let you get the hours and the people you work with are better.
good,Really fun place to work if you like to be around people. Also if you like to serve food and have real good people skills then this would be a good place for you to work .
good,There is always something else you can do. Fast past get very busy at times. Worst part was beginning a afternoon dishwasher and you show up for your shift and the dish pit is already full of dirty dishes.
good,Management works just as hard as associates. All service staff helps out during rush periods. Managers are interested in improvement of every team member.
good,"management could've been better. organization of overall company was poor, My co workers were fabulous though. And the customer base was exemplary. Would've stayed longer if it wasn't for the fact the wouldn't let an eager employee to advance."
good,"Depends on if you were an open or close manager. If you are a manager in the business, then you know the job. The hardest part of this job is working weekends and holidays."
good,I'm really not the best person to ask. I worked here for 3 month over summer vacation in HS. The employees were great! management was wonderful! I loved the customers!
good,"Great Environment to work in, I learned how to adapt to anything that has been thrown at me. The hardest part of this job or any other is to realize that things don't always to make sense to you, or be the most logical. You just kinda of have to roll with the punches and you can either adjust and survive or fail. The most enjoyable part of my job is when guest tell my managers about my excellent service, without any persuasion. Just on action alone"
good,"You going to wash the dishes, putting away the dishes, pick up and replace the bins and taking out the trash for the whole shift. It's very fast paced and It hard to keep up if you are the only one doing all the dishes."
good,"Brinker International offers complex training that cultivates the company  culture in the workplace. The compensation is fair, although serving wages vary widely based on the volume of guests. Upward Mobility is fairly opportunistic working for Chili's. As a former student of management, specifically Human Resource Management, Brinker's HRM policies show face as progressive and adequate, but the implementation of said policies is less effective than an employee would hope. Management on an individual level (I.e. The actual managers), is very efficient and pleasent to work for."
good,"A typical day at work was fun to interact with my coworkers. All my coworkers supported me and I supported them. I cant call them coworkers,but family cause we learned personal and work life. What I learned from chili's was really educational. chili's taught me how to manage and solve problems. They gave me the oppruntunity to learn and showed me life lesson. The Management were my biggest help cause they listened to me learn and move up in the chain. So they crashed coursed me in management until they couldn't. The management and my coworkers were a big help in my life. My coworkers always had opinions to guide and help me. Even though sometime I couldn't understand, but I learned. The most enjoyable day of work were interacting with the guest because they were friends and allies I gained. All the guest showed me love and I showed them love back."
good,Good for a student. I enjoy working there it was extra cash for me. All co workers wasn't professional but management is good and the customers enjoy the food.
good,I opened this store.  I experienced some of the best managers a store could have.  Great job for anyone who wants to move up.  I loved working here
good,"I Loved working at this taco bell, the general manager was always understanding and helpful in work. He was a hands on teacher and true leader."
good,"It is a good company to work for. Decent pay. Can get really busy. Pretty basic server job. A rather large tip out. Can get a lot of undesirable shifts like food running, hosting, etc.."
good,"a typical day is walking in at 12 in the afternoon and it stayed busy  till midnight "
good,Not a bad place to get your feet wet in the cooking game. servers do what they want. VERY HIGH turnover so don't bother learning names until at least 3 months.
good,Chili's was a good job for me when I graduated high school. The managers were great and the work environment was fun.
good,"My first job was at Chili's. I had no real knowledge of what work required, however, I learned so much from working at that facility. I would clock in, talk with some cooks in the back and assist them with food inventory. Then, walk up to the front of the store, checking my inventory in my work area. Restocking pencils, menus, silverware, and a variety of other items. As time passed people walked in, I greeted them, walked them to their seats, and this became a ""dance."" I learned time management, Servers were particular about when they wanted this table or assistance with running their tables food. My co-workers' began to love me, They said, ""You catch on quick."" The hardest part of my job became working too hard, doing other peoples job; I like a challenge, and if I feel I have surpassed what is required am ""hungry"" for more response ability. When I resigned my job the most rewarding part as I look back was the knowledge."
good,Great place to work to make some fast cash. Total control over your income. Must be able to multitask. Management is usually very understanding. Hours are flexible and income is dependent on your work ethic.
good,I mostly enjoyed working at Chili's it was one of my better jobs. Kept busy at all times ensuring food went out on time. Overall felt like everyone respected each other.
good,"Management was a little in and out with how they care about their employees but overall I felt happy at work. I worked as much as I could. The Chili's I worked at didn't really have much flexibility, if you needed a day of the managers you give every excuse not to actually give you the day off or they would push the time back of your shift but still say to come in. Overall though if you have no other obligations they were really easy to work for"
good,Just go in and clock in to start working. As a dishwasher i would get my station ready and then start washing dishes. as cook i would stock the food up and then start cooking.
good,I enjoyed working there i was given many opportunities to advance in the store. I started out as a To-Go worker and worked my way up since i was not 18 yet. I began to move up to an Expo worker which increased my hourly rate then began to learn all the other roles in the store which made my role much more helpful. As soon as i turned 18 i changed to a server but could still help others do the job i use to do.
good,"Typical day includes providing an excellent dining experience for our guests, Cleaning, stocking, and communicating.  If you do a good job with your guests, you'll make good money.  For me, it's good supplemental income, however not the right environment for me.  Would prefer a higher end restaurant where there aren't lazy workers who haven't figured out what they want to do in life.  There is one general manager and 3 managers.  There is a lack of consistency amongst the managers.  Hardest part of the job is when other co-workers don't do what they are supposed to do and I have to take care of it."
good,it was a great place to work but to much drama managers are friends with employees and hardly got good hours customers were awesome to wait on its a dead end job unless you know someone
good,Managers were always understanding. Most of the time we were busy but communication with partner and host made it easier.
good,A great up beat work environment. Interacting with guest directly. Demonstrating teamwork between colleagues
good,working here was great i loved it all the way up until we got the kiosks because it cut back on everyone's hours and eventually forced me to have to find a job that gave me more hours.
good,The location ended up being a great mixture of people. So glad I came to this store and got to be around the different culture it’s a different world down by the water
good,My co workers at the job were awesome they were hard workers and every day was a busy day it was a good experience tho knowing how to work and how to be quick in the situations when it was a busy day from working here I definitely could say that now I work more even harder since I started that job
good,I'm 24 and was looking for 40 hours+ a week. The 11.50/hr sounded pretty good if I was getting the 40 hours but I ended up working mainly part time between 20-30 hours a week. Not enough for me at the moment.
good,"A typical day at work is following up on systems to assure guest needs are being met and shiftly financial obligations are being met. Making sure everyone is in place to carry out their specific job requirements. creating an environment that's friend and fun "
good,All the managers at the time I worked there were very friendly and accessible. The benefits were good as well. The equipment to perform the job was outstanding.
good,"My location was not busy at all. Mangement was great and very understanding. Tips werent great, but location was seemingly good until I started working ther.e"
good,"very fun and fast-paced environment. take guest orders, buss tables, provide excellent customer service to all guests. coordinate with the cooks to ensure speedy and efficient delivery of food"
good,The time i have worked at Chili's has been nothing but fun to me and very productive. I learned how to become a better server here as well as learning how to be a better team member.
good,The management team is amazing very understanding. My co- workers are funny and fun ti be around. Very hardworking people. The most enjoyable part of the job is cooking for people and making peoples meals the best i can make it.
good,the manager at chilies was the best he made it a fun place to work. Loved interacting with the customers and the servers were awesome.Knowing that i could go to work and be trusted
good,"Worked as a greeter in restaurant , Seating Customers .  Work in the back preparing silver wear for Tables.  Helped other host when needed in order to seat all customer and Large party"
good,"Besides running out of product constantly and having to pick up slack from the entire building , front and back responsibilities working long hours and not getting appreciated for anything it was a good place to work, the customers and other employees are great !"
good,"En planta el ambiente es bueno ya que interact unas con la gente, en cocina es pesado pero esta muy bien organizado, pero el área administrativa no siempre es excelente en las sucursales"
good,loved making new friends with customers. fast paced energy. great team to work with on a daily basis. room to go up in the company if you applied yourself.
good,Everything falls back on servers. If a cook messes up a meal the server got the short end of the stick.
good,Good atmosphere! Up beat! Taking orders from customers lots of customer service to earn tips.
good,"I got to talk to a lot of people that came from many walks of life. Of course I would take their entree orders, get them their drinks. Make them feel like they are the only table I am serving. Keep the tables clear. My co-workers were great, we all chipped in serving and clearing tables. Most managers were great, there was only one that made it difficult to stay positive when she worked the floor. But my customers never knew it. The hardest part of the job was dealing with that one manager, and trying to understand why some guest didn't tip me after giving them great service."
good,I was at Chili's for a little over two years everything was going fine until they hired another general manager who didn't know what thel she was doing and the place went downhill so I left
good,"We learn not to depend on anyone in the store specially on busy day."
good,"It was an okay job, I liked it but they wanted me to do stuff that was not my job. Most of the servers were okay and friendly. I liked the environment."
good,"Everything about this job depends on the manager you get. I had several good managers who all advanced and moved to other places since we were a manager training store. Unfortunately my manager at the time was not up to par and has since lost his store's title of ""training store"""
good,I enjoyed socialising with guests and being able to take care of people.
good,"Hard place to work for, fast paced and management was horrible at directing people how to do their job!  I never liked being there, the main manager was always yelling so the servers yelled with him!"
good,"You work very hard but it is a busy restaurant to work at. The company keeps it busy by sending out extreme amounts of coupons and offering deals such as 3 for 10. The management at my store is good except the GM,"
good,I loved the money i was able to make and if you are in school they are usually willing to work around your schedule. Great job for the weekends and evenings. I have had some bad experiences with the management 3 separate ones. They are very strict with end of shift duties. It sucks if everyone doesn't work as a team. It can also be very difficult working in a serving position with some of the customers. One more thing i felt personally I did not like was that the company donates money to planned parenthood.
good,"If your restaurant is slow do not stay there, it gets to a point where it'll cost you just to work there. Everyday is either a hit or miss. You can walk out with$10 or $150."
good,Working there for 8 years was a great experience until they changed alot in the type of company they really are. It changed my decision on everything I thought about them
good,Management is not secure and not on the same page ever! Very unorganized and inconsistent. Only thing I miss about this place is the customers
good,Amazing experience and wonderful way to interact with others
good,"loved working with my co workers, Bartended over the weekend mainly. It would of been a better place to work if the General Manager knew how to treat his employees and keep to what he says. Overall it was fun place to work but management made it unenjoyable"
good,I enjoy my job for the most part. I am looking to get into a full time postition
good,Working there it was always slow. We had to be on our feet constantly with nothing to do . We always had to be at the host stand and have a smile on our feet and keep kid menus stocked and if i was a Servers Assistant I was constantly running in the back
good,I opened every day during the week.. I have seen so many come and go from there even managers. They never worked together as a team. Backstabbing was happening there.
good,"The mangers don't really care for your personal health, they'd rather you get the job done. Hard to ask for time off especially if its an emergency. Talk down to you like a kid."
good,Loved this job but had bad management at the time  each manager had their favorite and if u were not that person  u were constantly yelled at well the rest of the favorite crew members slacked off
good,"It was a very high paced environment, I loved the job itself, Would have been happier if the culture was better and the workers were happier. Overall it was a pretty average job."
good,"I moved locations after 4 years with the company, at my new location I was treated very poorly by management and other employees."
good,long shifts that go by fast by always having something to do. fun people to talk to and work with. after three months an employee can receive food 50% off.
good,Overall Chilis is a great place to work although at times it can be quite nerve testing like any other fast paced job/ restaurant. Employees are very welcoming and open to eachother . Managers also offer the same welcoming energy for employees as well as customers.
good,they lure you in saying they will give you hours and they do at first then they cut them back to basically nothing. they need to quit hiring people when we get enough people.
good,"This field of work was truly a great atmosphere with my coworkers treated one another as family. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the management and the kitchen. Once the kitchen began to get backed up, that would throw off the rest of the dining experience for the guests. Being a server, the frustration of the guests falls on me and then that becomes an issue with making money. Overall, I enjoyed the guests and working there!"
good,Siempre me quedaba mucho mas de mis horas no respetaban las horas de estudio y habia mucha falta de etica
good,"Shared a 6-9 table section with another server."
good,"I only worked part-time, but I learned a lot about customer service. The management was not very good, since there wasn't much direct supervision to employees. Many were doing what they wanted. With my colleagues had good relationship since many were young college students. The hardest part of my job was to carry heavy trays with plates of food and there was that I hurt my back. The part I liked most about my job was that I had my first experience of working in which interacted with the public and knew many new people all the time, to the point that as many as they returned wanted me to serve them because the last time who came felt comfortable."
good,"Team player, involved in community activities as well. Loved greeted guests. Found the huge trays full of heavy plates somewhat hard for huge tables."
good,"Good for those that are starting out with a first job . Young adults and teens. Fun environment. Busy , work environment could be better . Better team , better management ."
good,"My experience as a host employee sitting customers at a very busy establishment was awful because all my server co workers hated when i sat them a table on there section! First of all yall servers came to chilis to make your paper! Its not the host fault the restaurant is always busy and you cant keep up with your tables. Never really had problems with actual customers, the job is fairly easy and good pay :)"
good,"Some days are better than others . I started off as a host, than to Togo, cook, server all in my 3 years . I loved working at chili’s until we got new management then this is why I’m leaving unfair, some people get treated different ."
good,truly the only reason it’s a bad environment is bc of chili’s management and cooks. we can always be the better people and show them how to prevent arguments as a team player.
good,Chilis was a temporary job that i started in college. It was a great job temporarily and led me to the career field that I am in. Great work experience.
good,"Fun environment, fast paced, management isn’t there all the way but it’s getting better. Some days are better than others, not all days you’ll make more than $100, some days you’ll make less in the beginning of the week. Overall good company to work for"
good,I loved working at chilies and I loved our GM  but the management they hired was our previous bartenders and still had that mentality. they did not care about the customers like the staff did and it really showed.
good,Working for Chili’s has perks and flaws. Management is not very courteous when it comes to family or personal life but overall the pay was worth it and I don’t regret it.
good,Its was okay. this was my first job in food service and i was honestly bored. all you do is swat people and clean every day. but if you want an easy job for minimum wage its not bad
good,Love the service and compliments I would get from server. Could have used better management I think it was cool being a waiter and a great opportunity to meet people and serve them
good,"Was a good job while it lasted, however the location that i worked at no longer exists on the florida state campus and has been replaced now with a restaurant of another name."
good,I've been with this company for 9 years. It has been nothing short of amazing to me.  It is very rewarding and the benefits are good too. Paid vacations are awesome.
good,Working here was great for almost 3 and half years but management will take advantage of you and it eventually starts to affect your health which is why I chose to leave.
good,It was not a bad place to work lots of positive things.Most of the staff was friendly and got along. I would work there again if they offered full time for my position.
good,"The hardest part of this job was working so hard and watching others slack off, some kids there dont realize how lucky they are to have such nice and passive bosses, that being said the bosses are to nice to the wrong people.They should be nice to the people who go above and beyond, yet they seem to be attracted to those who lack work ethic, and let those same people do whatever they see fit. I am not sure if it is because they want to better them or not, yet i do know that it is unfair to those who work so very hard."
good,Started working as high school part time job. Enjoyed the development and culture of the restaurant staff. Was able to advance after spending time and transferred to a new store location in order to keep a job while going to school.
good,"Fast paced , over time when it is need it , pay rates was good , no paid vacation , just sick hours ,working all type of hours , no time for yourself, no break taking"
good,"easy, regular restaurant pace. management is good but when they are stressed the whole restaurant is. Definitely depends on the people you work with because people change and come through all the time."
good,"Overall, this place allowed me to be flexible with my schedule and allowed me to make enough money from tips. I made a lot of friends and kept a great work ethic."
good,"It was a great experience, but it just wasn't for me. The way it was set up wasn't right. The mangers couldn't get their minds together and agree on one thing and it just made it harder for the employees."
good,"-the culture of this job is cut throat, and very stressful. the thing i didn't like about it, some older staff that were more experienced would take advantage of the new people. the pay isn't worth the work, and sometimes it feels like slavery because you have to sell yourself to the customers."
good,worked here on and off for about 10 years or so started off making 7.25 an hour and ended up making 12.00 an hour after ten years so that's kind of bogus but other than that its an ok place to work the kitchen is small
good,typical day would be clocking in and checking tables and then waiting for them to get filled. I didn't learn much here already knew everything except their menu items.
good,"It Could be Been Better , I Appreciate The Opportunity They Gave Me . I Encountered New And Different Races , It Was a fast paced Environment. Some Of The Customers Made My Job Harder Some Made My Job Easier .Overall I Sometimes Miss Working For Them ,But Now I Need A better Job."
good,"I enjoyed being around my co-workers at chilis everyone got along well except for the shift leader, if it weren't for him I would still be there! Could use better pay."
good,"It was all and well for a long time, the management is flipped out so quickly that you usually don't have to tolerate anybody for too long."
good,"It was a great experience. Helped maintain the restaurant on a daily basis. Constantly greeting guests, seating them, running dishes, and running food. Management had there focus where it wasn't important. Some managers wouldn't know how to ring in certain items."
good,"I really enjoyed working for Chili's. I was with the company, in total, for about 4 years. I started in Portage, MI and absolutely loved working there. I had a fabulous manager and amazing coworkers. We worked well together and became great friends."
good,If it was a slow day my shift always got cut short. Co-workers were easy to get along with. Managers were always on top of their job
good,I worked here during the summer and it was perfect for that type of job. It was not something that was sustainable for a long term position.
good,I enjoy working with my company and guest. It is a great environment to meet many different people. I enjoy working in a team environment to get a certain tasks finished. The most difficult part of my current job in the instability from day to day earnings.
good,Hard work for little pay. Sometimes I would work 12 hour days and be lucky if I came out with 100$ a day. Hardly any breaks at all!
good,I enjoyed working with my co-workers.  Fun and fast paced environment for a working college student.
good,"It was usually a very pleasant time at work, I learned more about customer service, how to greet and seat people, and how to read the kitchen screen. My management was pretty good. We had three awesome managers who always dealt with issues professionally, and were always friendly to customers. You always knew what they wanted out of you, and how to do so. They were always willing to give you help if it was needed. The last manager however, was rude to everyone, constantly belittling everything you would do, and would treat his workers (and customers) horribly. He would drive customers away, and make everyone quit because of his attitude. The hardest part of the job was dealing with this manager, and working by yourself on a 2 person shift. However, I really enjoyed all the people I got to talk to (who would eventually request me by name), all the friends I made, and all the stories I got to here for all the experiences the guests had and enjoyed sharing."
good,"Working at Chili’s was a good growing and learning experience. I got to work with a lot of different types of people as well as learn how to deal with different types of customers, and how to handle them."
good,"Every day is kind of the same thing and a lot of coworkers have attitudes and bring their personal lives to work, making it a very toxic environment to be in"
good,It was a good job I got me biceps it was convenient I stood not that far from there so it works out for me I don't have nothing bad to say about them it was okay
good,Another serving job nothing special or crazy . Management was pretty good . Other servers were very helpful on assisting me to complete my job . With new tricks
good,the people and environment was amazing. if you don't mind working 5pm-2am then this job would be perfect! the only way to get hours was to be able to work late nights/early mornings. they did not want to train anyone else to do prep cooking or morning shifts and there was no room for advancement. but it was a great job!
good,good job if you were in school and didn’t need to live off of that job. the schedules at walkways different and you never knew how many hours you were going to work. manager need to connect to workers more.
good,"This job is a fast paced environment. You need to be a quick learner, friendly and able to be very flexible with your schedule at the drop of a dime. Your schedule changes from day to day, week by week."
good,i will recomend this company to my friend ..also te store location is good big dining..you become happy inside and outside of the stre.the food great and tasty.
good,Era un mesero con apoyo por parte de la gerencia para poder culminar mis estudios.
good,Great place to work for young energetic individuals. Fast paced and diverse environment. Great communication skill building job. This is an ideal job for those wanting to create their own success.
good,"After so many years working here, and being such a big corporate company, they would care about their workers a little more. They are very inconsiderate and only care about working you like a dog!"
good,"The job tends to be stressful, it is a very fast paced environment. If you can focus on customer service, while being able to effectively multi-task then you should prevail. However, corporate tends to care more about how you look on paper (ex. scores from ziosk, or how many president's you can sell), than actually evaluating you as a person. Sales is their main concern (they are a business after all)."
good,I enjoyed my job and managers at the chilli's in Utah but sadly I had to leave due to financial issues and move states. I transferred to one out here in arizona and I got nothing but disrespect and I felt worthless.  Just another person to put their work into in a small work space.  I was miserable. So I'm sad to saying don't work there anymore. At least at the one in Utah.
good,"Chili's Grill and bar was a decent place to work especially when everyone was on the same page. It could be tough at time like when someone calls out and you have already worked three doubles. That just when you have to be that team player that they need and roll with the punches. It also could be beneficial when someone calls out, means more money in my pocket.  All in all Chili's is a good work environment with flexible hours and decent money"
good,Good place to work if you devote your time and energy on the weekends...if you don't have a familly and another life outside of chilis...cant take your meal to go for some odd reason but u can eat there dnt make any sense!..good job as long asbu like working weekends!
good,It wasn’t the best to work their. Was really slow and they didn’t really clean up like they should. No one really cared about what they were doing or about others.
good,"No es muy grato el ambiente laboral , pero muy activos"
good,"Limited advancement, pay is not comparable to other payments.  No time off, management is ok. Company only pays for top half of uniform.  Discounts on food."
good,"Chili's is a fun environment to work in, they have good food and people you work with are great as well. I would recommend them to anyone, I would go back myself!"
good,"Working with different people every day, staying positive during stressful times.Working hard to meet the needs of each customer in a timely manner, busy or not. Understanding customers orders, what they want. Make it a fun personable place to have dinner"
good,Very nice guest and great tips. Co workers were awesome and management was good for the most part. High customer volume ensures a steady pay and keeps you busy.
good,"Typical serving job. Customer Service, Greeting tables, orders, money handling, juggling requests, delivering food. Very very fast paced. If you move at a slower rate this job will be difficult and ultra stressful for you. People (customers) expect you to be magic and pull their order out of thin air. People don't like to wait. If you are very fast and can keep yourself organized at this pace, then this is a good job for you. In my experience, the faster everything is produced ,the better the tips. of course there are always the people who complain about stuff even if it is up to everyone else's standards. Like I said, this is just a typical serving job."
good,Chili's was a pretty relaxed job. the environment was always positive and light. Management for the most part was really good and always helpful to employees and guests!
good,"I liked working at chili’s , very fast pace, and you have to be able to talk to the customers and try not to mess up on the food or drop anything , everyone was really nice"
good,When i applied to this job i never meant for it to be long term and i did make sure that i informed the management that this was the case during my interview.
good,"Food was great, everything was prepped how it is suppose to be. The right amount of food not to much or no to less. Everything was wash how it was suppose to be. And it was read on time and nothing was missing for the cooks."
good,"If you want your basic serving job, this is the place to go. Management sucks, food is gross, customers are rude, and the hours vs pay are ridiculous."
good,A place full of people on drugs literally. Everybody is in half way houses. The management would always complain but never did anything about all the people on drugs.
good,Meet a lot of different people from all over the place.. Very good work place for students in college and you make a decent amount of many within your shifts.
good,Pretty hectic environment to be in but still a very good learning experience. This job shaped me into the person I am today.
good,Chili's has provided me with the means to be a great server. I have honed my skills since joining the company. Overall I was happy to be working for the company. After transferring stores I have become displeased though due to decrease in volume from one store to another. Looking for something more fast paced or higher volume.
good,"Currently working in the busiest Chili's in New England. "
good,"They were a good place to work, the didn't have the best managers when i worked there. I typically got 5 or more hours a shift there. i left because they stopped giving me shifts so i decided to leave."
good,"How to handle high stress environment"
good,"Typical restaurant work. Management was nice. Not for someone who has a family. Late hours into the night, and no variation of scheduling. I never saw my kids."
good,"I enjoyed working for Chili's. The day was typically fun coming in and working with people, customer and employee. The hardest part of the job was wanting to work more hours and being the new person took time to get more shifts, the most enjoyable was actually being at work. I enjoyed coming into work and working with people and being able to relate and have conversations with people."
good,"This company is the best company I've ever worked for, they have been offering benefits with 401k, and all the insurances you could need - way before they were required to by law."
good,"Overall, I don't really like management they're unorganized. I loved my co-workers, except the student manager, he misunderstood his position."
good,"As a full time STEMs student, It is great being able to cram 6 days of work into three by working doubles on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday; leaving Monday through Thursday completely open to work on School work. You won't make a great deal of money, but if you strive for it, you can make enough."
good,"Большой бьем работы."
good,Management needs further training and stronger leadership
good,Money is great but expect to work A LOT to make it! Most of the time you don't leave until 2am.
good,When working for Chili's I learned a lot about helping the customers concerns. It was all customer service. Sometimes the customer could absolutely not be pleased. But overall it was a good customer service experience.
good,"A typical day at work at Chili's is giving guests a great visit to the restaurant, such as catering to their needs. I absolutely LOVE my co-workers. Most of them have became real close friends. The hardest part about my job now is that it's based on tips. One day I could make $20, the next day I could make $60. Another thing is that I have to share my tips and have to tip out the host. The most enjoyable part is making people happy and working in a fun environment with my friendly co-workers."
good,I was a very hard worker so even when there was not something to do that day i would find something to take care of or improve in the restaurant. Management at the restaurant was awesome but the area director was not very helpful and did not have the restaurants best interest at heart.
good,Stressful but I like it that way cause I took as many tables as I could to make as much money as I could...
good,"I enjoyed working with my managers, they really cared. I learned the true definition of ""Team Work"" here. a typical day would be a fun yet busy day, all crew member are participating in helping one another so therefore the day goes smooth. The entire day is fun from the time I get there until the time I leave. Sometimes when I am having a bad day at home work will actually put the smile on my face. We are like a big family. The hardest part of my day would be leaving."
good,Not going to review. This is not a company that I would recommend to anyone.
good,as an opening server i was responsible for morning prep and making sure everything was clean and ready to start the day. i learned alot about the opening of a new business. managers were helpful but relied on me alot to train new people . co-workers were all new to the trade but tried hard to learn. hardest part of the job was not being able to really work. the best part was seeing the people i trained excel .
good,"It is a great place to work. Everyone there is fun and makes the environment what it is. But it is a commission job so that makes it hard some days to survive when its been slow, and we all know the 2.13 an hour for all servers just doesn't cut it in the end. That's state minimum, not just chili's."
good,"I started with Brinker in Texas in 2002, opening the first ever Chili's Too (which are now found at nearly every airport in America).  I learnded the ins and outs of the restaurant business, and met some very colorful and fun people along the way (management included).  I worked many different positions, including quality assurance, cashier, server, and, by far the most fun, as a bartender.  While catering to every whim of customers can be quite a challenge, the teamwork and happy environment helped to get through the rough days.  The only downsides were, again, limited room for promotions, and relying on the generosity of strangers (tips) to pay bills."
good,loved the people that i came in contact with. management was terrible.
good,"Basic serving job you can find anywhere, depending on your area you can make decent money but that is all tips as with any job waitressing. Managers are minimally paid as well"
good,I loved working for chili’s. The only problem I had was not having a set schedule. You would know what time to be there but never knew when you was going to get off. One time I was only clocked in for 6 minutes and they told me to go home because they didn’t need me.
good,"Very fun workplace, however, corporate is pretty disorganized and it shows in both FOH and BOH. Some of the stuff is just not in the right place or isn’t set up in the most effective way. They also rarely rely on an expo, or QA. There’s not many people who will help you run food or bus tables."
good,depending on your location is the pace of the restaurant. Like with every restaurant you are only as good as your team. When I worked there I made friends that turned into family and had an awesome management team but overall it is my belief that the brand has taken a decline.
good,I just wish my machetes would inform me better. The other servers spmetimes have thing's going on and they're so intent on letting everyone know that they are having a bad day.
good,"it was alright  while i worked there , some days would be more fun then others . Overall it was a cool experience and most of the people there were so friendly & i like to learn as much as i can and i learned being in that atmosphere ."
good,Un día típico en el trabajo era que nunca habían compañeros para trabajar en equipo cuando lo había no trabajaban en equipo y eso es esencial en una cocina. La gerencia no hacía nada si necesitabas ayuda y los horarios eran pésimos.
good,I was able to relocated from Rogers arkansas to Boise with this company. It allowed me to have a plave to earn income while getting ready to bring a baby into this world.
good,"Like many fast casual corporate restaurant chains, Chili's changes management at incredible speed.  I was always given my requested hours because I had worked there for several years.  But insurance is too high for a Chili's budget and there are no such thing as paid days off.  This is not at all unusual in the service industry. "
good,"theyre ok not a dream job but it will pay some bills. the management sucks at least at the location i was at. no paid time off, barely any holidays off"
good,"A fun place to work, management could be better, pay is terrible. I believe higher pay would attract better management and employees. No breaks unless you request one and the manager approves."
good,"I liked working here. However, the place had a poor review and business slowed down incredibly. A lot of the issues could have been avoided with better management."
good,"My experience working at chilis was a good one majority of the time, and other times was a bad one. My progress from the beginning to end was very fast but worked out better in the end for me. I proved to myself and my management team that i could progress in the server life and be just as good as they once were. I enjoyed some of the people and meeting new people everyday. I feed off of positive energy and love a good environment to work in. Sometimes the managers made it to where you felt uncomfortable working for them like you couldn't come to them for help if you needed it."
good,Good for becoming a server for the first time. Working over time is easy and the pay is worth it. Some managers make working for Chilis fun and like a united family. Others make it feel like you are extremely expendable.
good,"Working at chilies was really fun for me "
good,It was a decent place to work . The kitchen was a very small and old kitchen . The set up of the kitchen was awful . The only way to half way succeed was to work together and no one wanted to do that . And if one person messed up an order it affected everyone else .
good,"Working at chili’s was a good first job . People I worked with were great some weren’t . The managers were good at there jobs even when times were stressful. I would’ve kept working here if it weren’t for the pay . There is lack of pay , $7.25 and hr which is not much ."
good,If you want to work for Chili's as management stay away from Franchise groups. If in an area that only has a franchise group research them first to find what kind of benefits (if any) they have to offer.
good,Chilís developed me professionally with the General Manager position. Acquiring experience supervising more than 100 employees and the whole operation of a Restaurant.
good,Depends on who you know in order to get promoted. You can easily slide by and be a manager for years and do the bare minimum but if you are passionate and excel then you might not get promoted
good,Crew members were nice. You didn’t have a problem with coming into work. Fast paced but can also be relaxing when not busy. Friendly customers. Managers were willing to work with you and the schedule you set
good,If your looking for a part-time job this is the place for you. It's fast paced and not a lot to learn great for a first time job. Great for students. Good luck.
good,It was a pretty decent place to work a bit chaotic and not really controlled well by the managers. A lot of fun people to work with. Pay every two weeks
good,"the host were not paid enough for the amount of work expected, hours weren't guaranteed . and they stayed micromanaging the host when servers always slacked around on their phones or with other employees, favoritism was real here."
good,"I worked at Chili's for many years, and saw many changes. I became very skilled at my job, and made good money. They are very thurough training staff. However, I will say that the management does not treat the staff in a respectful manner."
good,waiting tables can be high stressed at times but if you're good at it you can make decent money. chili's was a fun place to work overall for young person.
good,The management is shaky at best. managers either don't listen or don't care. most of my coworkers talk bad about everyone all the time. disorganized and have frequent scheduling errors working 2 jobs and being a college student. pros they are super laid back.
good,It's an alright place to work but i feel like if you want to work and achieve goal in your work environment this company isn't really for you.but it's fine for so something to do just not career wise
good,I've worked for Chili's for just under a decade and my overall experience with them is awesome! I highly recommend working for them because of the team and family driven culture that they have developed.
good,"Its hard to want to stay some where that you cant advance. If youre under eighteen you can really only be a hostess. Management was nice, but if youre a fast learner it wont work well. They train you very slow. You have to be good with people to be a hostess."
good,I love this Job! I loved every single person I worked with except for the GM. She was very verbally abusive to not just me but to anyone she worked with especially when she was in a bad mood. It was a hard decision to leave there because of poor management
good,"It’s wasn’t to bad of a place but sometimes they could be Inconsiderate of your life besides work. They do try to work your fingeres to the bone, and management doesn’t Appreciate there team players and the go getters. As of my co-workers they where awesome and great people, but as of management it was horrible with some of them."
good,Not an easy or carefree job. Only for people who can handle extremely stressful and high pressure situations. Many responsibilities. Be prepared to wear many hats at once. Do not apply if you aren't prepared to work extremely tirelessly and hard.
good,"This company is all about teamwork and staying focused. In the four years I have been with this company, I have learned several ways to multitask, customer service, and sales, and was supported by the staff around me."
good,Constantly worked in a fast paced stressful environment. The hardest part of the job was making sure that your tickets out in under ten minutes. That usually caused a lot of stress on myself and my fellow co-workers and made working there a lot harder.
good,"The front of house manager was not very understanding with things. It was said he was a meth head, and showed up to work high occasionally. Besides that, the other managers were nice, most of the coworkers were fun to be around, and the customers always put a smile on my face"
good,"It was an extremely stressful job. Management was horrible besides a couple of the managers. Unfairly treated by management, the played favorites. Its a good job and you have the potential of making really good money"
good,Really fast paced environment. Fun but demanding with all the responsibilities and demands placed on GM by upper management. Responsible for 72 team members.
good,"En chilis desempeñe dos puesto hostess/cajera"
good,"Run a shift with scheduling, filling in work positions when needed."
good,"Tudo para dar certo!"
good,"Fast paced environment, have a positive attitude and do your very best. tips at the end of the day are solely up to the guest.it is a rewarding place to work if you have a positive attitude and go to work to complete your job tasks."
good,"As a waitress I attended the customer, taking their order, serving the drinks, and as a cashier. Also as a bartender, I serve the orders of the drinks of all the guests."
good,typical day was slow moving but there was so many lazy waiter they had me picking up table for them. The management was either laid back or had a i don't care attitude.
good,its a job for more like teens. its fun but you have these teens running around doing what they want getting away with things and managment dont do anything about it. other than that it was a great place to work
good,I started serving when I was 18! Love working for this company. It is just time for me to move on and move out of the service industry. Looking for different jobs that have benefits paid holidays and 401 k.
good,"It was an ok place to work. hours a little shifty, they take u off the schedule when they want without telling you first. Favoritism played a part on people and sections they worked"
good,The staff was very friendly to work with but the managment was very lazy and even in busy times they did not help out employees to finish any work before completed
good,Sat people cleaned tables ran food they had me do a lot of work while I was there good people w lot of manager can and went worked there for almost 2 years as my first job
good,"Crew members were wonderful to work with, always willing to help one another on busy weekends or nights. Management overall was pretty good."
good,Chilis was a management training location and issues with managements conflicting opinions arose daily. a typical day including showing up to work on time (15 min early) clocking in and taking care of guests
good,"Great work atmosphere, customers on a regular visit basis, coworkers good friends outside of work. Wish i had more time there before I moved to LA"
good,"- service to the community "
good,"I enjoy working at chili's with the exception of hours.  I get scheduled on shifts i cannot work because of school, track, or personal health issues.  Other than that, i don't have issues with Chili's.  The coworkers are great, and they work together."
good,"Fun atmosphere for young adults to earn a little extra money, or a lot depending on how much you work. Very convenient location."
good,Very limited opportunity due to being a franchise at the time.  Salary caps with no raises available for two plus years. Atmosphere was nice.
good,Enjoyed overseeing both front of the house and back of the house employees. Took pride in meeting customers needs. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to multi task in a fast paced setting.
good,The most enjoyable part of this job was the people i got to work with and met along the way. My coworkers are got me through every shift. They helped make it more fun.
good,A typical day at Chili's is very fast-paced. It requires focus and teamwork to get the job done. I have stood out at a leader amongst my peers and value the working relationships we have
good,"It can be fun at times, you work there talking to people. If you work in the kitchen, it can be overwhelming but just take a few deep breaths and focus on what needs to be done. Just do your job and don't let others get to you."
good,"I have worked in the restaurant industry for over 5 years and Chili's may be the toughest establishment that I've worked in. There are no food runners or bus boys to aid the servers (which can be a plus if you are a strong server, since that results in less tip-out)."
good,"Open restaurant, set up operations for the day, check voice mail for directives from corporate.  Get in contact with area director for daily goals for company.  Run shift and set up for next shift."
good,"Active, Exciting, Productive, Always a chance to meet  new people. great food with fun  and exciting co workers. very flexible hours and understanding management."
good,"Co-workers were awesome, it's a very busy restaurant. Management would not let me return after coming back from school for the summer."
good,The Food and the service is Amazing i'm not sure jobwise much anymore because of my expereince i've had there i started to become very depressed working here and i just started feeling like they thought i was a child was very mentally challenged and it made me depressed because i even could of seen myself doing so much more than cleaning silverware there that either disappeared or everything was dirty out of the silverware and felt i should have been allowed to be more involved and didn't feel like i was a sercet before open hours employee
good,"Long days of prepping the same items over again due to a computer generated prep list. Not enough employees to accommodate the high volume of food items for each and every day. Starting pay and promises of pay raises are a joke. Count on no help from management and twelve hour days, seven days a week. They got monster energy drinks but you have to pay for them in the office."
good,I took orders and ran them and also took money. It was a very energetic atmosphere and I fully enjoyed working here. I would have liked opportunity for professional growth but there was absolutely no ladder. They did make it somewhat easy to be a student and mother while I worked there due to the flexible schedule.
good,"A typical day a chilis would consist of sweeping, moping floors, and washing dishes that need cleaned before the day starts. I learned that you have to push to the limit in order to get work done. The management was very good you were kept in order with all your work. The co-workers were like any other person they were there for the same reason you're to earn money and work hard. In my opinion i never find a job to be hard because if i push myself enough i can get the job done with any problems. The most enjoyable part of this job was just getting the work experience and meeting new people and of course getting my paycheck."
good,Great customers and lots of fun team members.  There is a lot of turn over in both staff and management so that can be difficult.  I love that it's a fast paced environment that allows me to meet many interesting and wonderful people
good,"If you like to work hard, move fast and just to have a living without so much to think of then Chili's is great for you."
good,"the management at chilis is very well trained and staffed they are there to help with all questions and needs."
good,"No help from managers, Place in ran inconsistently, easy money. Over worked."
good,i cleaned tables and floors. then did prep work in kicthen. I learned how to make portions of food. management was ok. No issues.Coworkers were ok to be around. The hardest part of job was getting hours. The most enjoyable part was getting hours.
good,"A normal day at work would be just clocking in and beggining my tasks of the day, I've learned to be quick and attentive to my surroundings, also that you need to be a team player to be successful. My co-workers are colorful people that are always ready to lend a helping hand should you need it."
good,"Being a server you are able to have a pretty flexible schedule.  The Management was fantastic, and I had a blast at work.  Other than not earning a significant income I have no other complaints."
good,"I would go into work, around 4pm I would work non stop from the moment I stepped in with a possible minimal break of 5 mins, my entire shift. No break in the restaurant business to eat, so my dinner usually consisted of eating food when I got home around 12pm-2am. I enjoyed the people, but don't enjoy the industry, upon expectations."
good,It was necessary to make to make cuts to hourly team members forcing managers into hourly positions to reach labor goals. As a result managers projects and responsibilities could not be completed during work day resulting in longer days or finishing projects at home.
good,the pay was more than fair for a busboy hard work because at the time i was busing alone from open till after lunch but you make tip share every day after the servers cash out. i would have to rate this as one of my top 10 for jobs
good,"I was a server, bartender, hostess, togo, kitchen, key manager, and administrative assistant to the GM during my time at Chili's."
good,un dia regular es bastante desenfadado y con una forma sin igual de sobrellevarlo
good,"Chili’s was a great experience I would work there again, they might need a little help with management because they have a high turnover rate but overall it’s a cool job if you mater what your doing."
good,Way that manager gave out so much free food. And didn’t stand up for employees on company’s policy. I didn’t like the pay rate of all the things we had to do as servers.
good,I worked at chili’s for a year at two locations the first location was great to work at and I made a lot of tips and friends but switched locations because of and issue with a manager and the second location I lost hours and didn’t make as much and had another issue with a manager
good,The job actually is pretty good what the scheduling processing is not right.. I think the store should have more understanding of how to work with people and the manager have to incite you with new changes.
good,"Chili’s as a server or bartender is great but has some limitations if you are trying to make a career out of it. Slow days can really throw off your income , and they don’t offer many opportunities for promotions, especially if the management isn’t right."
good,"If you like to work with food, then it is a good job. Very stressful and demanding job. The managment did their best to work with your schedule. The location was not busy enough to offer raises regularly. We never had breaks, sometimes working 8,9,10 hours straight with no breaks."
good,"The staff and management was always wonderful, sometimes I'd feel left out but they always noticed also if I was a little off having a rough day they always were encouraging. I worked there while I was pregnant and after and took great care of me and was understanding when I needed to leave before having my son. They also let me return after !"
good,"There is a lot of unequal treatment in this company. A typical day at work runs smoothly when certain managers are working and those employees that have been there the longest and that have worked together the longest. The hardest part is being treated as fairly as others. I love working with those who actually do ""work"" but there are many that don't and do not suffer any consequences or repercussions."
good,"As server you do entirely too much."
good,"I really dont mind working here. Its never the same situations each day, and management is pretty good. We have a brand new GM that is finding his stride, and we help him with duties to make him look good. Its win/win."
good,Most days were fast-paced and could be very stressful. Many customers are rude and have no respect for restaurant staff. Management could be lacking in job proficiency but was capable of doing their job correctly most of the time. Excellent coworkers with bad customers. No raises for hourly workers and management only worked around other's schedules 45% of the time. No benefits for part-time workers (understandable) but would undercut full-time workers to avoid benefits.
good,"The managers really do care about the people, very flexible hours, and free meals during training. They'll try everything they can to help you succeed as long as you're putting in the effort."
good,"This was a good first time job. It is very fast past, they had lots of rules and regulations. I learned a bunch of cooking tips that helped me create better, taster food for my next job."
good,It was a good place to start i got paid 12.50 an hour the managers where great i enjoyed the people. The oly problem was the other dishwasher did not worke week ends and he alwas called out so i got no weekens off and i got called in on at least one of his three days and i felt like i was getting screwed cause i was reliable witch is my only complaint.
good,The culture is average compared to any other restaurant I've worked at. Some days were stressful while other days were a breeze. This is mainly dependent upon the employees' attitudes.
good,"There is generally a friendly atmosphere to work here, most employees work well together.  Some management not very knowledgeable but most pretty good."
good,"I was literally told I was perfect for a management position, but would not be recommended because my current position would be left without me. I loved that company, and that just broke my heart."
good,"the restaurant i work at, everyone is always at each others throats. once per day, a co-worker cries, a manager gets over-whelmed, and the kitchen gets backed up."
good,"On a daily basis, I would work the lunch and early dinner hours because they wsere the busiest at those times.  The food was tasty and the restaurant was steady but not busy.  Tips were ok but probably hard to make a living with unless you had a second job. My coworkers were friendly as well as the management.  Nothing hard about the job and the most enjoyable thing was the interaction with the customers and giving them a fun and memorable time while at Chilis."
good,"I mostly cleaned up the front of house during closing, would have regular recognition's about three to four times a week. Had opportunities to try every new menu item that was released."
good,I loved working at chili’s! It was a lot of fun and very intense and i definitely learned a lot from that job. The managers were very unfair with the schedule at times but I’d definitely work there again if i were given the opportunity.
good,"Fast pace sometimes slow it all depends. Working as a Manager I do get a comp card which allows me to eat for free on a daily basis, but I do get tax for it."
good,I enjoyed caring for customers. The expectations for servers were realistic. Multitasking during peak hours was difficult at times. Some really helpful team members made learning a bit easier
good,it's a good place to make a quick buck but might not be the best to stay for long periods of time. Tips are not included in the final balance and the company won't compensate if you didn't reach the minimum wage per hour.
good,I was consistently promised promotional opportunities but they would often revoke the offers. Money was good for a chain restuarant but the amount of stress that was put on the team members was barely worth the job. Impossible to call out for illness
good,Worked hard and fast to achieve my goals on the shift. Management approached me to be a corporate trainer and help teams open new restaurants all over the nation.
good,"I loved working here. The only downside, just like any other restaurant is, your hours aren't promised. If it's busy you'll be there longer. If it's slow you'll be there way less and maybe not even make that much money."
good,"I have worked for this company for almost 10 years. I have learned very much and have grown with the company. While I love and support the company, I have seen the quality of food and treatment of employees decline through the last few years greatly."
good,The job is a typical serving job. Co workers and customers for the most part were great. Can tell the place is a bit mismanaged.However I enjoyed the work.
good,Working for Chilis was a great experience overall. It did have a great people culture but did change to more of a bottom line thinking company. This including with too many changing initiatives took the soul out of the company
good,"Fun workplace, great team members and staff. the hardest part of the job was rush hour and you are the only one working in your section. The most enjoyable part is having your co-workers there to help and support you while working and being able to lend a helping hand when needed. Management was amazing, for my first job they were very welcoming and understanding."
good,Enjoyed working in the fast pace changing environment. Enjoyed working on a team engaging with the team members and guests. weekend hours and holiday hours were difficult on family life.
good,"If you strive to work in a fast paced environment that involves friendly competitions, and good quality customer service this is a great occupation for you."
good,Chili's is a good place to work for a server.  Good tips and customers.  Most of the management crew were great and co-workers work well with one another.
good,"Working at Chili's was fine for the first month but they didn't train me correctly and place the fault of my mistakes on me. I will take responsibilities for my mistakes but if I was correctly trained, I think I could've flourished."
good,Working at Chills was highly educational and I further mastered my craft through their extensive training and focus and Best Practice. Their overall concept and mission statement are exemplary. There was a good balance of work time and quality of life afforded ~
good,"Usually one of the first to get to work, you catch on fast to stay busy always being on your feet. The managers are pretty helpful when needed. The workers are pretty much the same too. Hardest part for me is being able to understand what the people are saying over the phone. The best part is the food."
good,"Chili's is a decent place to work if you like arguing with people and if you like dealing with customers that are UBER difficult to please No matter how hard you try, it is NEVER enough.  The company removed all benefits so I had to go work with nothing to go back on for a while. The environment is nice but very cut-throat."
good,I worked at Chili's through high school and college waiting tables and bar tending.  loved working there through those years made decent money and made many life long friends.  When I started managing there it was entirely a different story.  There are entirely to many people in chain of command and you are micro managed entirely to much.  It is next to impossible to work your way up the corporate ladder without sacrificing your personal life and developing health problems from much un-needed stress.  I do love the company but it was not a pleasant place to work.
good,"This was a difficult job at first, and there are alot of moving parts that the management training program does not always cover.   There are alot of rewarding experiences to be had for those who work hard, but the high staff turnover extensive menu made it difficult to succeed."
good,chili's was my first real job. it can be very fast paced and stressful at time but can also be very slow and boring at other times. how busy it was is what determines how much money you will make as it is all based on tips
good,You didn't get paid for time off instead docked by reducing the better shifts and stations.  The pay wasn't consistent.  It was physically demanding and found more stable and less physical work that provided better benefits.
good,"Managed daily operations of the restaurant on various shifts weekly."
good,"title says it all. great people to work with unless you get on their bad side. other than that, make you feel like family and like you have a second home."
good,It is a very fast-paced work environment. Possibly too focusing on scores that you don't have complete control over. Good work environment and friendly staff.
good,"People I worked with at Chili's were always very nice. They always took care of each other. The managers were understanding. If you were having a problem or needed help, they were always quick to help."
good,"The people are fantastic however, you are forced to work on days you cant because they are understaffed, the hardly work with you on it. I work doubles a lot and there have been a few times they have tried to get me to skip school for work."
good,I would recommend chilis for someone who is looking for a second job. You can make good money if you are a hard worker. They need to offer better health insurance
good,La empresa es muy buena. Sus alimentos son super ricos.El gerente actual es muy exagerado.Pero si realmente recomiendo trabajar ahí.es muy buena empresa y sus ingresos también.
good,"As with all restaurant management gigs, work/life balance is a struggle. This company actively seeks to dispel that and to provide more balance. This can be a double edged sword, as at times, there could be more hands on deck."
good,"I learned the ins and outs of certain ways of buisness, working hands on and at a nice pace.The people were great and supervisors helped out a lot. I started as a dishwasher and then worked on the line in the salad desert and nacho station."
good,It wasn't a hard job. I was one me that did the job so I had my own work spot. Even when I was busy I still found it to be non stressful. I think it's a great job for someone looking to get out the house a few hours a day.
good,"One of the most high volume restaurant,food safety and sanitation are strict and  should be followed at all times,hardest part is eid celebration but very fulfilling. Management are kind and very helpful."
good,"I've worked at two different Chili's. My first Chili's, I absolutely loved. It was 2min from my home, amazing friends made there. Management was awesome. He knew what he was doing and how to run the store. I always got awesome hours. My new Chili's, not so much. I feel like the GM is still learning the ropes and his communications skills are sort of off..but nothing that time won't fix.  I also get very little hours, where my bi-weekly paychecks are not enough for me to even pay two bills.. The servers at both Chili's were/are always hard workers hungry for tables, and the hosts I've worked with are amazing as well. Chili's seems to have it down on how to hire great teams."
good,The management was great and I enjoyed working here. Everybody worked as a team and took pride in the restaurant keeping it clean and customers happy.
good,"Could work 8-12 hrs in day. Had a lot of fun in the kitchen with the crew. Some Management can be rude, but for the most part they can be part of the team. most enjoyable part was the crew had a lot of fun working and joking with them."
good,"A server is a very prestigious job for most people, but I like knowing when I clock out and to be honest, the restaurant life isn't right for me, although its the best I can do at this point, I want to go somewhere where I'll be happy."
good,"Generally speaking, I like most days. Other days are hard because of specific employees, but that has nothing to do with the company over all. Mostly depends on who you are working with that shift."
good,"Very fun energetic, fast past work environment. Learn a lot of different cooking techniques, Met a lot of great co workers! Loved being at work, sometimes high stress envoirnment but that's work anytime!"
good,"wait and serve on guest to my fullest potential. "
good,"It was fun working there, the staff and coworkers where all hard workers. When there was a rush people would usually offer support and there was great teamwork."
good,well its a fun place to work to begin with. They also offer training and provide menu knowledge. Usually when u have knowledge about the menu u can recommend the type of food or beverages according to guest preferences. i firmly believe that having a good and positive team creates good enviroment for the staff and guest
good,I love my job at chili's but it's not something I want to do the rest if my life. I want a job to were I can move up in the world faster and have better life for myself and my family.
good,"During week days at work, there is no bussiness like the other day we most of the time clean the restaurant from the top to the bottom. I have learned the culture and the meaning of the Chilis Brand, for management they are very weak and there culture is American Mexican food. The hardest part of the job it's they never give us day off during National day, Eid and New Year. The most enjoyable part we like to got outside in Jumeirah for celebration of christmas and when we reach the target of the months."
good,Improve management great equipments fun place with teammembers put more team building support the staff there are many thingsto learn in the company thanks
good,"Management is understanding of personal time and days off if needed"
good,"Job is good but there no benifits for the employees, no job security, good working place and nice invironment.i have learned  how to decipline my self and to be more patient,  management is good but it's hard for the to give us a raise, me and my co-worker are easily to get along with, and the most hardest part of my job there is sometime kitchen is under man."
good,"A typical day at chilis bar and grill is very fun, you get to meet a lot great new people, i have learned patience and compassion while working here, the hardest part of my job is being on my feet all day,and my most enjoyable part of my job is making the guest happy,and have them coming back!"
good,"Great place to learn new things and meet new people. However, it was a difficult place to work due to other employees continuously slacking."
good,el horario es cómodo y si cumples con tus metas semanales suelen darte premios o facilidades con tus horarios.
good,"Bueno mis dias eran llegar que me checara entrada mi gerente, ir a situarme a mi puesto, recibir y conducir alos invitados asu mesas, recoger menus a los oasis (zonas donde los meseros marcaban sus comandas) revisar limpieza y presentacion de los sanitarios, ayudaba a levantar muertos ( platos sucios de la mesa ) y si algun invitado requeria de algo me acercaba a ver que se les ofrecia."
good,"Was with Chili's from July 2010 to Oct. 2012.  I began my run on the aisle of O'ahu, then finished out in Vegas.  Chili's Honolulu was a franchise location (vs corporate) and was quite lax--one of the best gigs I've ever had.  It was truly the highlight of my 2-year wanderlust of ""paradise"".  Back in Vegas, the corporate mentality of the stores made it difficult to thoroughly enjoy my experience."
good,Work days for me are typically busy from beginning to end for me which I enjoy.  Whether I am prepping the bar for the day or waiting on guests there is always something to do. I enjoy all of the people that I work with and have a few friendships.  Management just changed so we are all still getting to  know one another.
good,I enjoyed working here the entirety of my employment I would recommend this place for anyone to work and or eat and drink there as well.
good,"I worked as a hostess and it was rather stressful sometimes because they don't have an online system for reservations so on the weekend there is always a huge rush and no real organized system to take care of a wait time. The co-workers are fun but were relatively an older crowd, management was really good about working with school livability."
good,"Fun place to work. Nice and short hours, sometimes. Responsible pay. Management sucked. Working there thought me to leave my belongings in the car or at home because people are mean and rude. The hardest part of this job was remembering the menu. The most enjoyable was the love the coworkers had for each other. It made the job that much better."
good,I liked the job. The best part of working here was meeting new people and the experience. the co workers were really nice.
good,Some managers are unprofessional and petty. One manager we call her petty Patty. Managers need more training. they don't care about you or your family only Chili's.
good,"The store became overly corporate. The actual enforcement was not the issue, the transition was just too rocky to compensate for the time lost during. The turn over was huge."
good,"Work got very busy. Guests got angry, staff members got into fights,  and management wouldn't always agree, but it didn't matter what tension was present between people because everyone always rallied together to make it through a busy shift successfully. Everyone had there favorite manager, favorite shifts, and favorite co-workers. Felt like there was a lot of unnecessary drama but I felt like my relationship with my co-workers was great, thus my good shifts always outweighed my bad. Brinker International is a wonderful company to work for."
good,Not the worst place I ever worked.  The best part of working here is the other people i work with.  Very fun and interesting co-workers.
good,"A typical day consisted of cooking."
good,"I love my job and my co-workers. Although I love my job and co-workers, I have no time for anything else as I am always at work. Would love to work more during the day but its just not possible."
good,"more and gaining skills and experiences"
good,"A typical work day at St. Lucie West Chilis' can go very smoothly but on the extremely busy night can become really unorganized.  I enjoyed working for Chilis, it was my second home.  For the most part everyone got along.  The hardest part about Chilis was working the floor by myself on a high volume lunch day. Also leaving Chilis was hard too."
good,Loved chilis my first 8 1/2 years then we got a new boss and he was awful
good,"Some people are too serious about the job. It seems difficult for them to ease up and enjoy it. They don't like to make the best of the day, they just want to work, and leave. It adds stress to the other workers and makes the managers uptight at times."
good,"Even though the hardest part of work was planning a routine for the day, every day was different and that's how I like it. I learned to cope with the every day changes that occured and more often than not this happened on the fly. I got along excellent with all my co-workers and most of the managers. Often times we would crack jokes or pull harmless pranks on each other. In closing, the most enjoyable part of the day was leaving work knowing that I was productive and did my job effficiently and accurately. I got a lot of personal satisfaction from that"
good,"It is a good working place, fast paced and lots of learning regarding treating people. The most fun part of the job was getting to know so many different people, with different attitudes and at the end they tell you that you served them very good and that they are very pleased with your service. The part that I most dislike is cleaning the restaurant after it is closed since you are earning only $2.13 per hour and in that time you don't make any tips to compensate."
good,"Nice work atmosphere, great co-workers and great customers. I am just looking for something with a more stable income."
good,"About the work of course there's a pressure between the guest and as, but we try hard to satisfy our guest."
good,"the hardest part of the job was trying to make sure that you got the orders correct, if you did it like the server put it in then you where right but if they didn't you had to throw it away and redo because they messed up."
good,Working here was as fun as it can get at a job.We always were having a great time but at the same time getting our work done. The manager was cool.He was fun to work with but let you know when your job wasn't being perform correctly.
good,"Management is wonderful, however the staff is very high school. guests are very rude"
good,i like the challenge of working on the line running back and forth during a very busy dinner/lunch rush. I work with a great staff front and back of the house. the hardest part of my job is going through a rush when we are short staffed but the greatest part about it is when we finish the rush and it feels good that we put all that food out and executed the rush in a great way. My management has much to do with that as well with controlling the calling out of the items between the front and the back of the house.
good,"I worked in a lean environment with as few workers as possible to maintain labor costs. I learned a lot about the 'ins and outs' of high volume commercial cooking at this job. The management was over-trained and often became stressed and angry when their laissez-faire methods failed to come to fruition. My co-workers were split into two teams in a division of the culture making it difficult to work in the culturally clashing environment. I loved the food, though, and loved being able to learn every aspect of the BOH of the restaurant."
good,A typical day of work was insanely busy. I learned a lot about the art of Customer Service. The management lacked control over the staff and my coworkers did as they pleased. The hardest part of the job is handling customers complaints with other servers when there were no managers to be found. Making a customer happy after someone else has caused them anger is incredibly hard because they stain your credibility. The most enjoyable part of the job was to be able to make people smile on a minute to minute basis.
good,A fun restaurant to work for. Rewarding of customer satisifaction.
good,"was nice to work there even the restaurant was news and most people were young with a few experience, felt like everyone know how work,"
good,It was a friendly place to work. Not to many late nights. I do miss it!
good,"Chili's is a great place to work. I enjoyed it more so then any other job I have had, but the down side of that is dont bother asking for advancement. Cause it wont happen. Would I work there again? Yes, I would."
good,Chilis is a fast paced restaurant that allows people to learn diffrent sides of the restaurant business it was a good environment to learn some essential skills
good,"•	Greet customers, take orders, run food to tables, complete duties, cleaning and side work"
good,"I applied all of my skills such as (thinking under pressure, communication, teamwork skills, excellent customer service) I’m always in the top 10 sellers and always making sure to increase the sells and making extra profits."
good,I work in a high paced environment constantly problem solving with face to face interactions with the guest.  I have enjoyed the flexibility of this position and the relationships that have been created.  My management team has pushed me to be the best of my ability at my position.
good,"Mi experiencia fue muy buena, aprendí muchas cosas"
good,They are a great place to work  everyone was very friendly and helping with training    I was starting my senior year in school while working here and only had a half schedule but had sports after school time and chili’s was very helpful working around that with my schedule
good,"I really enjoyed working with chili’s. The people were friendly, it was fast paced and the customers were nice. I learned a lot working there and appreciate the opportunities I had."
good,You have to have a good memory. Be friendly and fast. Being attentive is a must. And working well with others. You must beable to carry heavy trays run many drins and get apps out promptly
good,I work very hard always come n when they need me I do prep cook n I help with dishwasher to I think I need a raise I been there 8 months n I was promise I not got one yet
good,"For the most part I enjoyed my time there with the people I worked with but was overworked a lot due to being short staffed. People would either call in sick a lot, be late for work, or just not show up to work. It made it harder to work there. I ended up leaving due to relocating."
good,"an average day at chilis was many morning shift for me, which started at 11am and I had to be there by 10:30 am to cut lemons and open the front end. It was slower at first and then when lunch and dinner rushs came, we were all helping everyone. even the dishwasher."
good,After getting hired at chili’s and working there I fell in love with the company. I enjoyed working with my coworkers as well as serving our guests. I would recommend this company because they treat everyone as if they were family.
good,"I work with really good people but like any jobs not everyone is going to be nice or professional. My managers are very nice and helpful. I work for tips so "
good,"I really did enjoy the customer service aspect of this job. I have met some amazing people and made friendships with so many people. Sadly, I didn’t get enough hours to sustain the cost of living."
good,Es  buena enpresa aprendes mucho y creces con forme lo que aprendas
good,"Good in food production and caring of the guests. The management is good on problems solving"
good,un gran ambiente de trabajo con buenas espectativas tanto de crecimiento laboral como salarial
good,"Muchas horas no compensadas, pero por el clima con tus compañeros pasan sin darte cuenta."
good,No issues. Just personal reasons to leave. Friendly environment.  I liked the job. The staff was great. As well as the management.  No issues here.  Easy paced & money.
good,"I like working at chili’s, it’s an easy job if your not lazy. The staff are friendly for the most part. I usually get around 30+ hours a week. I like how I can request any day I want off."
good,"It had its days where the job was stressful but overall if you are a hard worker you will love working at chilis!"
good,I spent a year there everyone was a big family and everyone helped each other out. The managers were good listeners and took care of their colleagues and rarely had negative attitudes.
good,Opening and closing duties sidework duties throughout shift taking and delivering orders accurately cash handling guest satisfaction maintain company standards cleaning duties
good,I genuinely loved working at Chili’s. It’s like your going to work everyday to work with your best friends. Management was great also! They’re always willing to support you in other life endeavors.
good,"Besides being short staffed, or it being a friday night with a 45 minute wait, it was a fairly decent place to work. All the staff that had been there for awhile and wasbt quiting, were good people. The mangers were some of the best I've worked with in the restaurant industry. If the pay had been a little better I would have stayed."
good,"Good vibes from the manager and cook staff,I learned to read cook screen easy.. hardest part of working there,is when everyone not on the same page.i learned working well with others"
good,"Great atmosphere and staff. Managers were understanding. Warm, family like environment. Fast paced environment. Everyone helps each other out and learn"
good,Great place to work and grow. Great people to work with and money depends on your work. Go over there the food is great and drinks thank you for years.
good,"Nice work environment, although managers not interested in developing employees for future growth. Evening shifts tend to be stronger/ more lucrative than lunch shifts. Chili's is flexible with regards to scheduling when it comes to school, other commitments, etc."
good,"Providing the ultimate customer experience in a sanitary environment and routinely supported other areas of the restaurant as requested, including answering phones and taking to-go orders; maintained clean dining room, lobby, and service areas always; maintaining high standards of cleanliness and sanitation; delivered quality service by providing a warm and welcoming environment."
good,"I enjoyed my job at chili’s, my hours were flexible and my position wasn’t difficult at all. I also liked talking to new people everyday. I would recommend chili’s as a first job but not a career"
good,"I liked the other servers and the managment that I worked with. Seemed liked everyone was on a team and helped each other. Had a few bad seeds 1 being an asst. manager that had to have his ego boosted ALL the time. 2nd his ""pets"" got away with doing nothing. I always liked how they did their closing duties and had 1 ""closer"" that had to check everyone work before you could leave."
good,Great place to work and visit. I would recommend people applying for a position there. Awesome atmosphere with good food and service. Great co-workers
good,Great general manager. Okay for other managers. Two people in one big section. Pretty good teamwork. They are very generous there with time off and will help you as much as you can so don’t take advantage. Just be a good employee and they will treat you nice.
good,"Typical day depends on the customer, but it's more fast paced than other places I've worked. Hardest part of the job is learning the point of sale system and menu but coworkers are very helpful."
good,It was a good job at the wrong time they are a great company to work for and they tried to help me out as much as possible when I needed it the most there
good,Had fun working in the kitchen cooking and cleaning.  The nights and weekends schedule worked with school hours.  Plus they were easy to work with on getting time off.
good,"If you're willing to show up for work and put in an honest effort you can get more hours and move up, must be self motivated. There is opportunities to move up to trainer or management."
good,"We have poor quality customers because Chilis has too many coupons and discounted food. When you bundle meals for $25, you get entitled people from bad neighborhoods."
good,"Great culture of building/ developing people to perform and achieve results.  Leadership collaborated on how to get better and how to develop a great culture in the brand, restaurants, and the community."
good,"I love my job and my regulars and the $ at Chili's. We have a fairly new gm though and this is his 1st gm job. He is great, but lets others walk all over him! We have a 2 year from retirement assistant manager that is not so great and the other 2 managers are very new also!I feel that I have moved as far up as I can in this company without heading back into management."
good,"When I started it was rough, being my first kitchen job. But as I learned my zone I started making friends, inadvertently learning their jobs too. As my assosiates started to move on from the chilis way, positions had to be filled, so I trained a prep to take my position. As I learned the zones it all just fell into place"
good,"As a host, I loved my working experience. I was encouraged, motivated, and rewarded for a job well done. They were flexible with my other job and schooling hours."
good,Good place Late hours. I enjoyed the daily challenges and the charity work. A great career if you are young and have no kids since it is very time demanding.
good,They were great with scheduling. Cares about their employees. Would recommend it as a good place to work. Menu is easy to learn and they help if necessary.
good,Run tight shifts with very few servers and help. Can get hectic but you are basically doing everything. If you are not well rounded it will be difficult.
good,"Days at Chili's can be high stress. The environment is dependent on others working as a unit. Most managers are good, others are not so good. The hardest part of the job is working towards a seamless experience for guests. The best part is that it gives servers the potential to earn a lot of money."
good,The biggest lesson I learned or was reminded as a server is how to deal and work with all types of people and personalities; from co-workers to customers. The job definitely helped with multi-tasking and patience.
good,"a typical day at work is great , i learned alot , management is poor or not existant , the hardest part of my job was support form upper management.the part i enjoyed was the customers as well as employees."
good,"I loved working with this company. It was my first job out of high school and I went back 10 years later, It felt like home. Friendly staff and managers."
good,"You often are covering for the jobs of a lot on people an dit can be a demanding job, but if you have the right mind set, the job becomes easier and more fulfilling."
good,"I started chilis because I needed more money then I was making. I quickly realized that the management is not up to par. Also, there is no team work at all, other employees are very lazy and quick to argue about anything!"
good,"this is a fun, fast paced place to work. lots of hours avaliable but are usually given to those with senority. not much room for error at chilis, management could he a little more professional"
good,"its been a long time since i worked there, can only imagine the quality of life there has only gone downhill. as with any restaurant, the people are what make it fun."
good,Been many years since ive worked there. Unsure what all has changed. My early experience... Good work environment with solid corporate structure. Enjoyed the experience overall
good,Chili's was a fast paced place to work where I had to multi-task and be able to get along with others in sometimes stressful situations. I learned a lot about dealing with all types of people due to the customer service required working as a food server. I also learned about the standards and regulations of food service as a cook.Strict adherence to these guidelines was essential for this job.
good,I liked serving at Chili's. I had to leave because of school reasons. The current general manager is great and was very understanding of my scheduling.
good,it was a nice environment. Everyone was usually cheery. Only complaint was that seating system is a bit disorganize and can cause stress when the restaurant becomes busy.
good,"a place of fast paced work, have to be highly motivated to complete task, good pay,benefits, extra hours. the team motivates you and brings the competitive side out."
good,"Loved the culture of Brinker International."
good,this was a great place to work great staff pretty chill managers and as long as u did ur job know one hassled you the pay was nice but the hours where long like realy long and it made a personal life hard to plan around
good,"You learn a lot of skills that you can take to other places. I've worked here for about 4 years and I made sure that I learned things that had nothing to do with my current job, and now I know so much."
good,The manager's were great and employees got along for the most part. Best restaurant job I've ever worked. Main issue is with the corporate side of things. Constant menu changes ands policies that unnecessary and morale draining.
good,"Not smart for long term employment. I think this job is absouletly fine you need to have a good and strong personality, Its a pretty gross job so if your a germ a phob then don't work here."
good,No maternity leave or paid time off. Not many advancement oppurtunities. No minimum wage. Great management team. Everyone there acts as a family and works together. There are a ton of regulars and this location is always busy.
good,Once a Chilihead always a chilihead.  They have a variety of tools available to use that assist with your advancement in the company.  The conduct town hall meetings to reach necessary feedback to assist success.
good,"Fast Pace"
good,Great company to work for. Plenty of room for advancement. Friendly work environment. They worked with your schedule. Good benefits. Would recommend to anyone looking for work as a cook
good,"-The work environment was extremely competitive "
good,The chilis that I worked in was very busy and there were days that were tough due to the high volume of customers. This usually provided opportunity for personal growth as I was pushed to go outside of my comfort zone to troubleshoot the volume of customers.
good,Great money while serving with minimal hours worked.  The management is very flexible with scheduling in regards to working with my college schedule.  Would recommend.
good,Enjoyed working here but hours are tuff. Would work here as a second job again or simply a job on weekends. Very good pay if you are willing to work hard
good,"Chili's is your typical restaurant atmosphere, fast paced and customer service orientated. They serve great food and are always trying to improve. The management left something to be desired. And it wasn't always a fun work environment."
good,"- Sometimes busy, sometimes very slow"
good,"I got along with people there although stressful, tension built, but very few hours as a host. Overall a good first job and good position opportunities for the future."
good,"Great place to work! Fast paced, you had to be a fast learner so you knew the menu items well so you would be able to answer any questions the customer asked"
good,really don't have anything bad to say about chilies but the tips are about average as at any other places. I know I rather wait there then any other typical dinner  .
good,i started as a host then they trained me for to go but then they started training me as a waitress then they trained me for the bar. so I would either open the bar and end up closing the dinning room after my 10 am - 5 pm at the bar or i would open the dinning room then close the bar. sometimes if they needed someone at host i would do it if we didnt have anyone to come in or if we had no one at to go carry outs i would do that as well.
good,High-paced environment and many different personalities between the front of house and back of house. It was nice to have tip money after every shift in order to pay bills.
good,"Although my job as dishwasher required me to stay in the dishwashing area, the rest of the staff was very nice and pleasant to be around. Although some days are more stressful than others, everyone works as a team. "
good,"Just another restaurant not the best, not the worse, company needs better forethought for the future, good company benefits, but there is better out there."
good,You can move up the ladder fast if you are hard working and show promise. If you just stand around and make others have to work harder to cover you then you will most likely be seen as a obstacle and no be wanted around during the harder shifts.
good,"I loved working for this company. It was ran on a professional level, and continued to make guests happy and wanting to return. It was a very fast-paced environment and I was able to turn tables on an average of 45 minutes."
good,"Typical chain restaurant, turn and burn mentality. incredibly large sections, minimum side work. Great discounts and shift meals. NO bussers, have to run own food."
good,"Everyone was very friendly. I was able to learn different stations to learn more. The mangers were understanding, nice, friendly but a boss at the same time. Would go back there to work if I moved back to Idaho."
good,"Working for Chili's in Gonzales is not for the weak!!!! I do enjoy my job but it is a high stress, fast paced, guest first environment with long hours, schedule changes with no warning. On the bright side, there is never a dull moment. Working for Chili's has helped me to perfect my skills in customer service and has taught me to handle even the most difficult of guest with a smile on my face.  As a employee I get to encounter a  variety of people from all walks of life. Everyday I get to experience individuals from other countries, cultures & religious backgrounds. Chili's Gonzales is a interesting place to work because you never know what is going to happen when you show up for your shift and it keeps you on your toes."
good,I worked at the Abbeville location and at that time their was poor management. Also their training program was not great at all either. Very unorganized. I hope they have done better over the years.
good,"Atención al cliente , aprender la carta y brindar una mejor atención que en otros restaurantes."
good,"I think it was a fun place to work when I worked there. I liked the place a lot, it was a good atmosphere. The culture of serving fit well and it is a good place to start learning how to do jobs such as cooking hosting and serving."
good,Chili’s is a good place to work and the money it there. I just don’t see my self having more then what I have now staying working there. On a good note management is awesome and they make you feel like family. Money is fair so if your looking to make a quick buck this is the job for you.
good,Your typical restaurant. Fast paced and good amount of consumers which leaves ample opportunity to make more money. Easy to pick up shift and good group of employees.
good,great place to work for this type of job. it was nice but doing so  much more work with little pay and not in any job info or anything. get food half off only certain menu.
good,"Manage Front of House Operations (FOH)"
good,This was a great job while in college. They provided opportunities for growth and put a focus on giving back to the community through their affiliation with St. Jude's Children's hospital!
good,"A great place to learn about cooking, and nice manage. The co-workers are alright but most are unable to speak good English. Just stay in your side and you're likely to move up."
good,"This is a great place to start out, If you are new to the service industry or customer service this would be a good place to start out. They train their managers well and they answer any and all questions you might have. The pay is terrible but if you are young and still live with family it isn't bad to get your foot in the door."
good,Environment has improved a lot. Professional management and wait staff is well. Some servers do not like to work but others are very hard working and care about their jobs
good,Chili’s is up there with applebees and other low end restaurants when it comes to serving jobs. It’s kind of every high schoolers first restaurant job so don’t expect it to be super professional
good,"You show up, clock in and start taking tables.  its fast paced and you have to multitask the entire time.  I learned people skills and how to react to every situation, good and bad.  Managers are always willing to help with a table and your schedule.  Every Chili's has a wide range of characters to work with so never a dull moment."
good,"Got people that barely wants to train you, I enjoy the job itself, but the employees be a bit too much at times, I just be wanting to get work done, they just wanna joke all the time."
good,I worked for this company for 10 years and they for the most part did me right but that was mainly because I was so good at my job. Loved the people mostly
good,This job was decent. They were all nice and very helpful when you did not know something. You got discounts on the food unless you were the manager then they got discounts on different things.
good,el trabajo es algo sobrecargado y los superiores son poco accesibles en cuanto a las necesidades del empleado.
good,It's a good place to work if you enjoy engaging with guests and ensuring they enjoy their dining experience in a casual setting. Guests are typically just glad to be out and enjoy the variety of the menu.
good,"very laid back place to work, flexible hours, the more you worked the more you made. staff was fun to work with and vvery helpful. great place to start a career"
good,Great staff.  Very close and work well with one another.  Can be very fast paced a lot of the time but thats what we are there for isn't it? Make sure you are ready to work. Ive worked here for years and developed a great relationship with a lot of my coworkers!
good,chilis is a fun fast paced place of employment. Everyone is fun to work with. The plus about the job was the free food and friends you make being there
good,"Chili's was a nice place to work, they have really nice food, a whole customer service system and everything very detailed and explained. Shifts were good as well and nice co-workers"
good,"Chili's Bar and Grill was always busy, but i cannot say they did not warn me. The managers were always ready to help anyone who was struggling........"
good,open up store or close store end of shift paperwork managing front of house and back of house staff interacting with guests cleaning and organizing truck/liquor orders.
good,"hands down one of the most rewarding jobs ive ever had. great people, great management and you get to make friends that will last a long time. fun job"
good,"The Chili's atmosphere is fun, if you get done what you are responsible for and help others out when they need it you'll have a good time. I'd recommend considering it."
good,Had fun there. The changes at the time took us away from the culture of the business and just became too much to do well and we were having too much to do right
good,"I would welcome/seat everyone who walked through the doors. I would offer the bar because they gave free chips and dip, I also would sometimes help the servers when I had time on my hands. The hardest part of the job would be the waiting time, you could never really be honest and give an exact time wait. The best part of the job was working with a few co-workers, they made it go by fast and always made sure I was okay and making sure the customers weren't eating me alive."
good,Good environment not too noisy. Good for business great food plus deals.Also great pay and hours.Fast paced job must be able to handle two jobs in one .
good,"It was a good place to work at, I highly recommend, just don’t work at the one in white oak in garner because your whol experience will change. You will get frustrated and want to cry but the chili’s in Raleigh had such a great atmosphere."
good,Working at Chili's is both fun and challenging!! Very fast paced have to multi task! Get to met alot of new people and have fun at work!! And you get food sometimes! The best part is getting the chance to make the guests feel special!!!
good,Good place to work for a college student. Chances to advance but not many. Clientele can be very difficult to deal with. Would recommend for someone first getting into the food service industry.
good,"I loved the people there, of course we had problems "
good,If you like to socialize run around and meet new people everyday this is the job for you...lots of fun and super challenging when it comes to waitressing due to the high volume of customers and the turn over of tables..
good,"Coworkers and managers are friendly, collaborative, and always willing to lend a hand. The money is great, especially for how straightforward the job is."
good,"Really awesome place to work, lots of fun group activities where we travel and play sports and go to restaurants. It's very ""family"" oriented. Management encourages us to all be a team and love eachother. There's lots of ""ratings"" and feedback given to you, but you shouldn't have any issues if you're good at suggestive selling/upselling, and multi-tasking (especially in the bar!) It's hard work, but you make pretty good money, at least at my location."
good,"Working at chilis has taught me a lot about work but also about myself. I barely had any work experience starting out but I've learned to cook, make drinks, and expedite food. I've also became a lot better at communicating."
good,"Co-workers were great, management changed which is why I left. Customers can be horrible as well. Overall this was a good place to work, its just certain things changed."
good,"During the dinner rush , especially during the winter months, it is extremely stressful. If I learned anything serving at Chili's it was hoe to multi-task. You are constantly juggling multiple issues at once and constantly trying to decide what is the mist important task to do first."
good,Hay bastante trafico de personas por lo que se mantiene en movimiento.
good,Prep and Prepare food while keep and clean and safe environment. prepare a variety of orders with accuracy and efficiency as quickly as possible. Staff was very friendly.
good,Chili's was my first job. I only worked temporarily before I left to go to college. I was going to school in Louisiana and had to leave in order to get prepared for my first semester.
good,"Despite the fact that my managers were never there, it was a lot of fun! Kind of stressful when we were busy but everyone worked together to clean tables and get foood out. Also the food is so good and vegan friendly and I had the Santa Fe salad for lunch like every day!"
good,Fun but hard place to work.Very fast pace.Management could be more involved with the back of the house duties. The most enjoyable part of the job comrade.
good,"Had great culture."
good,Honestly if you need hours this is the place to go. The shifts can run smoothly and all of the coworkers are awesome. Its a fun job with a lot of perks
good,"Making sure that customers get their food in a timely manner, from the time that their orders are put in"
good,"Overall not a bad place to work. Management has switched over quite a few times during my time there, but the current manager seems to be doing great."
good,"Was a great company to start a F&B career"
good,"Good company to work, good management, friendly environment,I enjoy work with my team and make things more easy, good communication between co-worker and managers"
good,Fun environment to work in. Being in the kitchen cooking was good for a laugh. Most days you're listening to music of your choice laughing and joking as you prep and cook meals  . The camaraderie between the majority  of the cooks was great
good,"Very High paced. Be prepared to work with all different types of people being able to respect them and the work place all together. Great pay, but i didnt like the idea of a direct deposit on a card."
good,I was 16 when I started working here so it might've just been the newness of having a job but it was relatively fun and semi-productive. The staff wasn't always doing their jobs to the fullest of their abilities but the management tried to help make the restaurant a good place to work and visit.
good,"Working a Chili's has been great to pay my bills, get through college, have lots of extra spending money because I am only taking care of myself but I want a job now that I can use my education for"
good,"I worked at Chili's for a long time, it was a great job to have as a student, and I really enjoyed the people I worked with. Unfortunately the restaurant was recently closed and therefore I no longer have a job."
good,I really enjoyed the Jupiter FL location. I worked there for most of my employment at Chili's and the team was like a family. I started as a Host and advanced to many other positions. I learned a lot about the food service industry and how to treat customers. I received many praises from management and corporate individuals that would come in.  I transferred to Orlando and because of my experience would like stay in the restaurant industry.
good,you make good money in a short period of time. Customers can be very rude at times but managers will always help you when a problem occurs if the situation gets out of hand.
good,"As any job, it has its good days and it bad, slow days and very fast paced days. All in all its a job that teaches you how to treat people, how to handle any type of client and how hard work and dedication pays off."
good,"Each day is different. Always working with different staff and different guests. Can be slow and relaxed, or busy and high paced. Decently organized and has a good atmosphere for the most part! I would recommend."
good,"Just another typical food industry job. I work as a dishwasher part time. It is very laid back easy, very little stress if any at all. Dirty, wet and greasy but not a bad job for the pay."
good,I learned how a kitchen works. How your food at a resturaunt was prepared. I learned what it takes to run a restaurant. During the rush hour times it was very fast paced.
good,Typical serving job. Fun and fast paced. Great to be able to pick up shifts or give them away as needed. Managers are usually fair and understanding..
good,"This was a good pass-by job to get me through school. I learned great customer service and how to deal with cranky people. The sweeter/nicer you were, the bigger the tip you got! It was sometimes hard to make a living off that because I worked lunch shift and that wasn't the busiest shift."
good,I enjoy working at chilis. I've been there for quite a long time. It's a great place to work if you like a flexible schedule or are in school. I'd recommend it!
good,"En Chillis estaba de server puesto en el cual nunca me habia desarrollado antes, es un puesto en el cual estas en trato directo con las personas por lo que aprendes a ser empatico servicial, aprendes sobre todo a que el cliente siempre tiene la razon y en caso de algun inconveniente buscar una solucion en la cual el cliente salga contento, la parte mas dificil eran los horarios que no estabn bien coordinados podias hacer un cierre  a las 4 am y tenias apertura a las 10.00 am. lo mas valieso fue la cultura laboral , aprendi muchisimo con las constantes charlas y cursos que nos proporcionaban."
good,"Loved working at chili's but in the end I didn't like the GM and I went on maternity leave, I didn't have an urge to go back after my son was born bc of poor management and wanted something new."
good,"chili's was your average restaurant serving job "
good,"A causal restaurant environment with the brand recognition of Chili's logo. The brands does well involving its culture and its training. They follow the ""egg"" model. This starts with the first egg being CEO to the last egg the team members. It is a great company to have gain restaurant knowledge and beliefs. The bonus structure is not vey profitable. The current trends of technology have been adapted by Chili's as a brand. Through payment option and team member training."
good,"It's a great ambiance. Loved every day of it!"
good,"I enjoyed working at the chilis, it was a great experience and I was able to learn a lot, I would recommend this company to anyone looking to work as a cook."
good,"This was a great company to work for because the let learn so much by just putting me out there in the field and trusting me to get the work done."
good,"Working for chilis the past year or so has taught me a lot. I work better as a team and I have learned to take charge at whatever I am doing. Management could have been better, but overall I loved working there."
good,"A typical day at Chili's Bar and Grill would be an extremely fast, but enjoyable work day. I learned how to work quickly and do a diligent job while doing so. The management at Chili's Bar and Grill was great! Each manager always made sure to work with our schedules and help us as much as possible. The hardest part of the job would have to be doing many things at once. However, it was very rewarding to accomplish a hard task/tasks. The most enjoyable part of the day was when guest were able to say they had an enjoyable experience!"
good,It is a good company for a part time job. As a University of Puerto Rico graduate i'm looking to diversify and expand my knowledge in Business Administration. I have set a  goal to do just that in a different environment. I learned a lot about proficient customer service and being fast at it. The workplace culture is very good as most the employees work everyday as team to accomplish work tasks. A typical day is very busy and you have to be able to work under a lot of pressure.
good,Is a fun experience working at Chili's is has a fast working environment...got to be ready to go above and beyond..expect the unexpected ..be frendly to everyone..
good,"It's alright. It's so alright, it's just astoundingly alright. I enjoyed my time with this alright company. You should definitely give this workplace a shot."
good,"You have to be able to work as a team. Help your co-workers out, because it can be pretty stressful and get pretty hectic on busy nights. Overall, it's a pretty great place to work. If you deliver great service you'll make a good income."
good,"Chili's is a good place to work. They worked with me when my wife was in an accident, let me have as many hours as I needed since I was the only one working.  Enjoyed working here,"
good,This is the food industry so its pretty faced paced. As a server you have control over the amount of money you would like to make.Must have great hospitality.
good,"Easy schedule, quick cash, but has terrible clientele and corp sets in realistic goals.  The only good thing about it is your coworkers make it more bearable"
good,"Easy to work for the company. Easy to work for money. Hard to progress, and turn temporary into lifelong drive. Great job for those who are in between jobs. But nothing to stick too."
good,"Honestly most the people I worked with drank their way through the work day and I didn't know how they did it. I would have thought at some point they would get caught or just get tired of it but I guess when working in this kind of business that's what your surrounded by. So heads up. Be prepared to be surrounded by girls and guys barely legal if even legal to drink completely trashed at work attempting to make ""the day go by faster""."
good,Was a fun work experience and helped with expanding my customer service experience. Employees were friendly and was always there to lend a helping hand. We worked together as a team to get the job done quickly and correctly.
good,"Difficult and challenging management position. I also believe that Chilis offers far too many discount programs to their guests.  Between coupons, online discounts and rewards programs it is a confusing situation."
good,"I really enjoyed the relationships I made with all the team members that I worked with. However, I did not agree with some of the mandates set by the Chili's Corporation. My favorite part was seeing the satisfaction I could bring to the guests that I served."
good,"Learned that I am not cut out for restaurant retail work."
good,this place has a high turn over rate as well for servers and managers. it is hard to work in a place where it is always changing and not always for the best.
good,"Very adaptable scheduling, able to adjust as needed for my class schedule. I was able to stay with the company until my availability went down to one day a week due to school schedule."
good,"It has its ups and downs. Just looking for something different in a different location."
good,Consistent hours and a fast paced work enviroment. Frenetic in its movements not for the feint of heart. Can break someone not use to standing for long periods.
good,"In my opinion Chili's is a good place to work. Probably not great but good. It's a solid company. All the executives are the best of the business. Local management need some improvement, thought. The company provides with an excellent work culture. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with some of managers. The best part definitively are the customers."
good,Chilis is a good place to work if you're looking for some quick money. You get your tips in hand every night you work and that's always a good thing. There's a lot of extra work attached to being a server at chilis as well.
good,I felt like a member of a family when I worked for Chili's. They welcome you with open arms and want nothing but the best for you. They will work around your schedule.
good,"Hard work most nights, very fast paced. The years I was there however, I had fairly good coworkers (turnover is quick) and a great management team for the most part."
good,Chili's is a normal restaurant. There was quite a bit of drama but that's just the food industry in general. It wasnt the most enjoyable experience but I would recommend it as a work place for someone looking to get into the food industry.
good,"When I worked at Chili's it was a very fast pace restaurant. I waited on parties of up to 40 people by myself. It was all about team work, customer satisfaction and cleanliness."
good,Fun place to work and great people to work with. Always busy with something to do. The most enjoyable part of the job was changing people's attitudes when they were upset.
good,"Our management was great, well balanced between fun and professional. due ti inherent employee turn-over, the first three months were a bit lonely, but afterwards, I became a part of the family."
good,"management is kind, staff are different every few months except the lifers, it's a job, you make decent tips. paid all of my bills having my own apartment and only this job."
good,"Great working environment. Love working with the customers and certain management staff. Location is great, right by Walmart and very close to the mall"
good,"so typical work day consisted of daily label changing, cleaning equipment throughout the shift. learned how to move in quick environment and under stress. most enjoyable part is recoving after a rush.."
good,"It's serving. However, they're focused on making this company a very well-oiled machine. They are very self-aware and keep everyone accountable of they're actions without losing sight on the fact that everyone should have fun and they could be making quite a bit of money doing so. Which was the best part; having money in your pocket every night."
good,The job is not for everyone you have to be willing to work and get your hands cut up but other then that the staff is amazing. I recommend working here.
good,"The work place was light and fun, people there were kind and understanding. It could get busy and stressful at times but your coworkers always made it bearable."
good,Basically serving tables is a job where you have to constantly be on the ball and stay in a positive mood while so. Good place to b employed if you have an outgoing personality and dont mind being busy.
good,I enjoyed working a Chili's.  I actually would love to get into management there some time soon.  I love Brinker as a company in general. Excellent company to work for.
good,Very upbeat and fun place to work while I was going to school for Dental Assisting. I worked with a wonderful team who always were on there toes and ready to work.
good,"Chili's environment was very fast paced and fun. The food not being very expensive or take long to make resulted in fast table turning, and quick efficient service."
good,"I have no complaints about this job, the workplace, people and job was great. I was looking for something a little more permanent though and something full time. During the time period of working here I was diagnosed with lupus which makes it very hard to be on my feet as much as a server needs to be. It was a good job but im happy to be in a full time position."
good,short work days. Make a lot of drinks. Management was good. most enjoyable part of the job was my co workers. guest were very nice... good foodl.......................
good,"It was a wonderful place to work. I learned a lot. Even when it got extremely busy, everyone worked together to maintain a clean work environment with happy customers."
good,"The typical work day at Chilis is very fast pased. I learned alot about the kitchen, and all the procedures. Managment at this resturant was so so, some of the managers were great and some needed  a little more work."
good,"Buen clima laboral, trabajo en equipo, conoces a mucha gente."
good,I worked at Chili's throughout my undergraduate and graduate college career. My managers were very accommodating of my schedule and working at Chili's allowed me the flexibility to change my schedule as needed. Management tries hard to make its employees feel valued.
good,"A good place to work if you are good in typical restaurant chaos and fast paced service. I learned to deal with all types of people and that I can always stand to make changes to the way I do things. Management was decent, not very involved. The culture was different than most restaurants I've worked in. The hardest part was my co-workers. The most enjoyable was seeing people enjoy the specials that the chain offers, drink and food wise."
good,"Chili's was a great place too be employed for the 7 years that I was. I made excellent money daily, and I was always guaranteed work. The management was very flexible, most of them friendly as well."
good,"Chili's is almost always busy, people will come in either because of the name or the constant promotions. Sometimes the promotions kill check amounts though. Tips can be extremely generous or the opposite. Management team changed at my store a lot, some combinations were better than others. Bad hiring led to bad team work and attitudes. ultimately it is what you make it. if you cant handle a large table section you wont make it here. Chilis is all about volume and maximizing profit. one server having six tables isn't uncommon but the server may only need to be at the table to take the order and do refills because of the ziosk, which has hit or miss performances."
good,Buen ambiente laboral horarios flexibles el pago para part rime muy poco
good,I was a host as well as a Server. it was a fun job that had me consistently dealing with customers. Customer service as well as quality of food was first and foremost priority.
good,"It was a great work environment when I first started, very strict and taken care of. Over the years it was more fun than professional. It was great money though."
good,"I liked my job for a long time until a shift of management and staff shook the place up a bit. Not an awful place to work, but my last year was slightly rocky."
good,Very typical restaurant position. High turn over rate. Upper management was not always as professional as they should be. Company does have a willingness to update and stay current.
good,"Overall, the job was very easy. Do not double seat a section (unless necessary), help run food and drinks to tables, keep kids menus stocked, and clean. The pay was excellent for a college student."
good,"Great job environment nice co workers "
good,"Out of all restaurants I've worked in, Chilli's was my favorite. Very upbeat. great co workers. managers worked with you."
good,long hours but lots of opportunity and freshness. You can get promoted from within. New craft beers on tap. One weekend off a month and vacation.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Chili's, but I just became burned out and found myself with extra responsibilities and no extra compensation, so I had to get out of it. Good company."
good,"Chili's the only thing that is good about this job is the pay, the managers sucked and they are rude and I think they are racist, cause they laid off most of the black people and most of the supervisors was rude and not helpful at all."
good,"I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the people that I worked with, but I just hated my actual job and every time I came close to getting another position I had it yanked out from under me"
good,I took on many roles for this company  From a Busboy to a Manager in Training and every thing in between  Very flexible schedule with ability to change times great staff and a fun environment every shift
good,no morning dishwasher therefore piled up dishes at noon late hours that your not schduled for lots of conversation between employees stay late on weekends everyone would go home and there would only be 2 employees closing
good,I would typically come in for the dinner rush at night and would help guests to their tables an clean off dirty tables to help keep everything running smoothly. I enjoyed talking with customers and making them feel as though they were in a welcoming environment.
good,"Chilis was a fun experience job, I had a lot of fun working for this company, I ate good food and had good drinks, the people were nice and respectful"
good,The schedules are flexible and fair. Reward loyalty and productivity with prizes and better sections. Easy to get hired and started working. Must be very personable and good at multitasking to do well.
good,Working with the crew at chili's has been overfull fun and whenever someone is stressed we work as a team to fix the problem.
good,"Customer service"
good,"I enjoyed working at chillis , i learned new job skills that i can continue to use for future jobs. I enjoyed working as such a team."
good,one of the hardest part is when new year comes it is really hard to work but i got plenty of friends that we helped each other so the job will become easy
good,It can get very hectic but I enjoy serving others and making people happy. My managers are very helpful and the food is great! They are very good to their employees.
good,This is an awesome place to work. I just decided that I didn't want to be a forty year old server. Although having a four to five work day instead of an eight to ten hour work day doesn't sound so bad.
good,"If you work hard, it will be worth it. Has great work environment and very fun, caring management. Fast pace, good paying and flexible schedules."
good,What I love most about working at Chili's is the comfortable atmosphere. I love the family feel between all of the employees.
good,"While it can be a bit exhausting to meet so many new people and carry out so many tasks, it can also be quite helpful and beneficial for the real world. I made a lot of good friends and learned how to sell things as well as manage time and countless tasks amid adversity."
good,I enjoyed my time with this company. Everyone is a team player. Mangers work around schedules and are very nice to their employees.
good,Chilis was a great place to eat and work with a fun filled staff and managers that would take care of their guests. A day at work is filled with fun and stories and great food. Such an enjoyable place to enjoy some southwest food.
good,"Overall a fun fast paced place to work. The only problem I had was working around my availability. There were never enough hours for me(being a new person) as there was an overload of hours for the people who had been there the longest. Also, no room for advancement."
good,"Girls were awesome, most of the managers were good, side work was easy. The biggest issue I had was when my partner needed help on a 20 top, I came over to help, ended up where it was so disorganized and she ran off to go take on her families table, I was left to try and clean up the mess. When I had asked management about help, I got told to just work with my partner and she wasn't there really."
good,My typical day at work here involved seating about 5-20 customers daily depending on my hours. The hardest part about this job was the customers attitudes. The most enjoyable part was working with my coworkers and talking to customers.
good,"Over the years I've worked with different types of people and learned so many new things. A typical day at work is where everything is going smooth and flowing right with no complaints. I've learned to work with all different type of attitudes and that everyone doesn't think like you. My co-workers and managers are very helpful and friendly, their always there when I need them. The one thing I enjoy about my job is meeting new people from all over and giving them different ideas and activities to so while in D.C."
good,Loved working for Chili's and Brinker! Got to become involved and learn from many positions and areas of interest within the hospitality industry because of the opportunities given here.
good,I like chillis a lot and the franchise I worked for was also great. My only problem was the specific location I was working at didnt get a whole lot of business so I just wasn't making enough money.
good,this is a good place to work and make good money if you are willing to put the work in. the serving staff is strong and its pretty busy on the weekends
good,fantastic place to work. didn't quiet agree with management. our town unfortunately wasn't busy enough for me to stay working here.
good,I very rarely had problems with this company. I enjoyed the fast paced work environment and loved interacting with guests and my coworkers. I learned a variety of skills from this job.
good,"enjoyed working for this company, my co-workers were easy to get along with, team work was very important to me i feel like thats how we get the job done"
good,Prepared food. Trained and received education on new plates and proper procedures. Great employees. Great opportunities to relocate and to move up in company
good,"Great place to work while in college, the managers work well with you and your schedule. Fast pace and high energy environment."
good,"A typical day at work requires a lot of standing and walking around. As a host, one cannot take breaks to sit down because there are always customers coming in to be seated."
good,"easy job for college students who are trying to make some money on the weekends, doesn't require much effort, just show up and collect your money at the end of the night"
good,"Overall, Chili's was a fun place to work. Yes, it got a bit crazy at times but the staff was more of a family than a group of co-workers."
good,"Team oriented, family diversified, goal based, hard workers, level headed management. Customer service was always appreciated by the entire staff. Goals were met while having fun and displaying professionalism."
good,i had a death in the family and they stopped scheduling me when i needed them the most ! but thats on management. i learned how to be swifter under pressure. my coworkers were cool .. everyman for themselves
good,tasty food with good management and fun co-workers. my day consisted of cleaning tables and taking trash out and keeping the bathroom clean
good,"Good place to work, got plenty of hours. Fast paced environment with room to grow. Hard to get weekends off unless you put in way in advance. If you don't mind working holiday's and weekends its a great place to work. Good tips."
good,chilis was a fun and laid back place to work at. Always busy waiting on tables and doing side work. Management was easy going as long as you kept up with your work through out the shift.
good,The managers were all friendly and supportive.  The operations just runs smoothly.  Enjoy working with the team.  The group practices teamwork and at the same time achieving the team's goal.
good,"Overall, a good experience. The popularity of the restaurant ensures busy weekends, which gives employees a chance to make a good amount of money. Management is sometimes forced to make changes that negatively impact work-flow due to pressure from HQ. Co-workers are the best part about Chili's by far since the restaurant hires people who are happy and upbeat."
good,"I had a lot of fun with the co-workers I had during my 8 years here. Management was suspect at times, but were always there when we needed them."
good,I just moved to Richmond to attend VCU and they were very welcoming. I made good friends with co-workers there and learned a new restaurant style. It was a good place to meet new people but also gave me the chance to work toward my potential.
good,It was a lot different working with food. In the food business you deal with people's attitudes more than you would in retail
good,My typical day at work is very exciting. It is very professional as far as giving great customer service to their customers.
good,A busy restaurant that taught me skills in working with the public and my fellow co-workers.  The hardest part of the job was trying to satisfy an unruly customer.  The best part of working at Chili's was seeing our repeat customers.
good,"At Chili's I was mainly working mornings. My daily shift would consist of preparing meals, working on prep for everyday functions and setting the line up for the day. Co-workers here were friendly and  hardworking. Management motivated me and provided guidance and support when needed. Working evenings were a challenge some nights as per lack of staff. Overall Chili's was a fun and enjoyable job."
good,"This was a great experience for me! My managers were awesome, my co-workers were fun and friendly, and the customers were easy to deal with."
good,"met and trained great people, flexible schedule, loved working with the public and getting to know them personally, co-workers were friendly and helpful"
good,Fun and happy environment but too much drama. Arguing over shifts and seniority got the best of me.  Your ability was not seen.
good,A typical day for me was very simple. I greeted and sat guests at the appropriate tables and in an orderly rotation for the servers. I also made sure the work environment was swept and clean. The hardest part was timing our guests. Our wait list would get long and we had to give them a wait time which no one really knew an exact time. The most enjoyable part was my co-workers everyone was very nice.
good,chili's is a very good company. the only issue that i have is we keep getting new management staff. which is making it pretty difficult to continue on my path of moving to a higher level with in tthe company. my new managers appear to be great and i absolutely love most of my coworkers.
good,its was hard work and that management are more obsesed with corparate and not about the customers they run out of food all the time and some of the food was cooked well or done right..
good,"A typical day is coming in to work ready to take tables. We wait for our section to be sat and take turns taking tables. We use team service from all the servers in the section to take care of our guests experience. We pre-bus and serve each others tables. Then we split the closing duties between the team members in the section. We do our closing report, give our money to our manager, any leftover money from sales  is our tip money since we make change out of our own pocket. "
good,"Days can be a hit or miss. We can either be really busy or slow. I've learned great multi-tasking skills, customer service skills and how to better myself constantly as an employee. Management is always helpful and curious to listen to our opinions. Co workers are great and we work together as a team. Hardest part of the job is if you aren't getting help from your co workers and most enjoyable is when you and your co-workers are working together great as a team"
good,There are very many things going on for employees to strive to do their best. This company helps an employee gain interest in pursuing a future with the company based on ones own need to move further. The restaurant runs well when the GM down to any employee level have respect for one another. This company often has opportunities to show management and upper levels how well you like your job.
good,It's a great job if you need fast cash and with tips it really is a decent dollar per hour job.  Fun staff to work with.  Shift are normally 6 hours long and the hours are awkward.  Since you are feeding people you will work during hours that you would normally be eating lunch/dinner.  I learned to be personable and patient with people.  You learn to multi-task and manage your every action to be the most effective worker possible.  The hardest part of the job is being on your feet all the time.   The best part is the relationships you can build with regular customers that come in to see you.
good,"This is the place to work in kingville if you are good at working in a fast pace environment. The employees are so fun and welcoming. The management work just as hard as its employees, always leading by example."
good,I learned about the food business and learn how to cook. Management was good but the hardest part was cleaning up. The most enjoyable part about this job were the co-workers.
good,Everyday was a good day. I learned speed when I was working there because we had a certain amount of time to have the skillets greased and all of the silverware wrapped. Management was great and they always smile but being professional at the same time. My co-workers were the best and I would work with them any day. The hardest part of this job was when football season started and we had to be extra fast to finish everything before the football players got there. My most enjoyable moment was everyday because my co-worker was always making laugh when I did feel down.
good,"fast, detail savvy,great part is u work alone, management is great, best part of the day is dispatching worst part is closing out at the end of the day"
good,"I love the restaurant business, mostly because of the different people you meet daily. I would still be there if I didn't move states!"
good,"meet greet seat all patrons entering the establishment.  Being an over the top team player to everyone in staff, to include management, bartenders, servers, to- go specialists.  Answer phones and take to- go orders when available.  Keep the store clean, including restrooms and all FOH."
good,"All in all, my experience at Chili's was good, full of challenges and positive peer interactions with my co workers. Making sure everything was done as fast as I wanted it to be done--i.e., making drinks and serving guests--was one of my biggest challenges, one that I conquered on a consistent basis. Management would deal with their own issues, usually consumed by guest concerns and fixing server mistakes, and we would all do our best to help one another out to work as a cohesive team. That, as well as a job well done, were the most enjoyable parts of any work day."
good,"Working here was a fun and comfortable environment, I learned how to politely greet guest, management was great, and co-workers were polite. The hardest part of the job: not enough work hours. The most enjoyable part of the job: being around new people and seeing new faces."
good,"i meet new people everyday and the food was good. Nice and fun place, young and fun people  with a lot of energy. Sometimes it was to busy, but it wasn't bad."
good,okay place to work but no vacation pay if you lose your medical it's because they don't schedule the right amount of hours my routine was basic co workers easily to get along with managers okay the owner stops by in Hawaii to check out the restaurant operations.
good,My day to day tasks consisted of running the kitchen and the bar.  I did all the food and liquor orders wrote the schedule for the kitchen and maintained a food cost that was with in the company's goals.  I did enjoy this job at the beginning but it lost its fun when working for a general manager that did not want to help. He preferred to push his work into my lap which made doing my job much harder.
good,My days consisted of talking with customers and seating them. Cleaning up the dining room. It was a simple and easy job. Long days on your feet. Management is great.
good,"I had fun working at chilis. While it could be really fast paced at times, the environment was fun and upbeat. There was always good music playing that lightened the mood. I had consistent hours and there where opportunities for extra hours if you wanted. Employees got good discounts when they came in outside of work which was a major plus. For the most part, it was a pretty fun place to work. I did quit this job because of poor management at the location I worked at but I wouldn't say that incident reflects the company as a whole or even that location. Things happen."
good,Great through school due to amazing flexible schedule. Has taught myself many things that will carry with me and memories that will never be forgotten.
good,"Working with chilli's was great, I enjoyed serving peole and working with my co workers. management was great they were really flexible when you accomplished your job. i have no complaints."
good,It was always a fun environment to work in. We all got the job done and helped out. I really enjoyed working there. Management were all very balanced in making sure things got done and making sure our outside lives counted as well. We were given the time off we needed and there wasn't a fight for hours back then.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Chilis.  There are some managers you will love and some that you will not like as much.  Same goes for the employees.   If you have never worked in the food service industry, it is more stressful than you think."
good,Professional colleagues that work together well and provide necessary support and backup to get the job done.
good,Every month we conduct training and seminar about food menu and sanitation. We have company accommodation and shuttle service provided by the company.
good,Enjoyed working for this company. Compstantly getting new and improved foods on the menu. Guests are able to take a survey at the end of dining to rate their experience and their servers.
good,Effective management can be learned from this employer. They cultivate industry leading managers.
good,"if you work hard for them they worked hard for you."
good,"Working in Chilis for me is very tough, standards must follow,manager line check must also be follow,monthly restaurant audit of all item,also weekly shift meeting with all the staff for all menu reveiw,, thats why ive learn alot with this company in comes with food standards,managers, and operation..."
good,"- Well organized infrastructure"
good,love my coworkers only thing i wasn't crazy about were the hours you work especially on double shifts.
good,Job was busy and they pay wasnt not too good since i made all my money in tips but overall it was a fun experience.
good,great place to work pays good .Orlando store never gave me a chance. Miami and the Utah store I flourished and was a cooperate trainer and Miami and Utah were training stores meaning we trained all managers for store in the area.
good,Pretty standard serving job. Management is amazing. Pretty laid back and relaxed environment and great for networking.
good,"Prep for the day, be hospitable to customers, and clean up my area. Most enjoyable part was the work environment."
good,Chilis is a nice place to work with a relaxed atmosphere. The management is good at delegating jobs but lacks in a personal connection with its employees.
good,Co-workers are amazing and the customers are usually great as well. Management is very hands-on and available.
good,"The Chili's I worked at was located on Ramstein Air Base in Germany. Though I'm not sure this is still true, during the period of time I worked there it was considered the busiest Chili's in the world."
good,I would take care of all tables assigned to me. I learned how to memorize large orders in my head. I had great co-workers and managers. I loved working at this place of employment.
good,"An typical shift at Chilis would start off with my co- workers in a great mood. Our managers would make this fun, exciting, and competitive by having games such as ""margarita madness"". Servers making the highest sales on margaritas would win something big, keeping everyone encouraged to up sell drinks like crazy;it was always fun to hear people set high goals and actually WANT to meet them. We were also extremely involved in the St. Jude foundation. For and entire month we would take in donations from our guests or anyone willing to help, and give them a St. Jude coloring picture of a Chili's chili. We would decorate the entire restaurant with the pictures that we would get back representing the difference that everyone was making. The employees were all able to decorate our own St. Judes Chili's shirt which we were able to wear as uniform throughout the month; it was always a pleasant chance from the basic uniform. At the end of the day, things like this made our chilis family really tight,and i enjoyed my time working for this company."
good,I was a server and would help make sure every customer was satisfied.
good,"I worked at Chili's during my last 2 and a half years of college. The hours were very flexible and accommodating to my school schedule for the most part. The environment is very fast paced and long weekend hours, leaving little time for school work, which was very difficult for me. Management was amazing. They made sure to accommodate to my class scheduling as much as possible so I could still get my hour. The most enjoyable part of the job were the customers. For the most part, many were very nice and came to see me regularly to get updates on my school progress."
good,"A typical day at work can be quite stressful, however the managers and other employees make the shifts fun. The hardest part of the job is keeping a level head when things do get stressful however if you are good under pressure this is the perfect environment for you."
good,"Nice people, super culture, great people, relaxed work culture"
good,"I was in charge of coming in and setting up my bar for the night shift. I took care of all the bar patrons, the full-service well, as well as barback duties."
good,"Serve food and beverages to customers and to make sure their overall experience at the restaurant enjoyable. I made sure the food was upto par before bringing it to the table and to make sure the restaurant was clean and to proper standards. The hardest part of the job was dealing with unhappy and agry customers, but when others thanked you for the great service, it was fulfilling. The management her was supportive and flexible and made for a wonderful job."
good,"At Chili's I learned extreme patience and customer services skills, both with guests and coworkers. Chili's provides a fun, flexible, and fast pace atmosphere great work a college student."
good,Always looked forward to going to work.  Great team of co workers.
good,"Fair treatment, good benefits, high energy and friendly workplace."
good,typical serving job. Great opportunities to learn about the company. Able to make money in short amount of time. Prepare to learn lots of food.
good,waiting on tables. How to be better in customer service. management was cool. Co workers were a team players. Making sure the table get the right food.I got to meet different people.
good,"I enjoyed my time here, and it was profitable.  However, it was very typical restaurant chain.  The guests were always enjoyable."
good,"Work was usually pretty relaxed, some days were busy, but it was overall a fun place to work. The managers were easy to talk to and, most of the time, understanding. The people I worked with were all so easy to get along with. It was never awkward, because everyone was so outgoing. I learned that it helps the day go by smoother if you help your co-workers whenever you get a chance. The hardest part of the job is not getting an attitude when you're given attitude from an unsatisfied customer, it is manageable though. The most enjoyable part of the job was just getting to be around cool people."
good,"My coworkers and management team were easy to get along with. Our managers always tried to make each shift fun! Our guests were from all walks of life, which made each day a new adventure. The hardest part of the job was that our busy times were based of the military pay period and when there was ships movement. That also made the job very enjoyable. Being able to welcome the sailors home and give them a hot, delicious meal for the first time in months puts a smile on everyone's face! I have learned many things at this job. For example, how to react to different types of people. Never in my life have I run into so many people from different states or different countries. This job has taught me a lot of life lessons and quite a bit about myself."
good,"Any position waiting tables is stressful, but at Chili's the expectations set forth by management were very high adding to the stress of employees."
good,"The staff become a family. Pay is not the greatest, but it is a fun environment."
good,This place is a great dining restaurant to take your friends and family. It was always exciting working for this company the co-workers were friendly and helpful.
good,"This job was great for a college student that needed to have a flexible schedule to work around my classes.  As a server I was responsible for taking care of guests, cleaning and stocking the restaurant, and training new employees.  The management team had very high standards which lead to a clean and organized work environment. As always, my coworkers were a mix of people who took their job seriously and teenagers straight out of high school that took a little more motivation. The hardest part of the job was learning to juggle multiple responsibilities while trying to meet immediate deadlines.The most enjoyable part of the job was the people interaction and of course the instant gratification of cash in your pocket every day!"
good,management changed while i was there and that completely changed the day to day standard of what was acceptable which was to raise the bar and thats never a bad thing
good,"Great if you are in school, they are willing to work with your school schedule (for the most part). It is a fairly fun, but also fairly demanding job."
good,"My day and evenings are with people of all ages. I assist many customers with answers to questions about our Menu , our management and also our staff. I answer the phone at all times also answering questions and taking reservations. The hardest part of my job is being patient with customers and giving them an answer with a smile. The job can get very demanding at times but I must remain pleasant so I can assist customers in the correct way. I enjoy being with people and this part of my job makes it so much fun. My co-workers and Manager are there for support and we work out problems together as best we can. I have learned patience with customers and even our staff. This position has given me the confidence to deal with the public in so many ways."
good,The great thing about chili's is that you will become part of their family. The managers are a little frustrating but that's their job. This is a great place to work and they just re-modeled the restaurant.
good,"Chili's as a general is a great company to work for, "
good,"I just left my job at chilis because I wasn't getting enough hours. I am seeking a waitressing job full time and I have a very flexible schedule. I am interested in bartending though I do not have experience in that field yet. I am a great waitress, love the public, and enjoy being extremely busy!"
good,"Working with the public can be very stressful, but you have to have a hard outer shell. It can be very fun but you have to be a hard working person and be able to take what ever is thrown at you."
good,Brinker International was an exciting atmosphere and truly a simple job. There wasn't too much that I needed to learn for this particular job. As long as I showed up on time then I was able to perform all the duties needed of me. The hardest part of the job was to not get tired of repeating the same thing over and over. My co-workers were all wonderful people as well.
good,"Learned all about multitasking, as well as money handling. I loved interacting with customers and giving people a great experience."
good,a typical day at chilis was laid back and at times stressful but fun. mgmt was good. co workers were fair. most enjoyable part of this job was meeting new and exciting ppl
good,Very busy work environment. Very friendly co workers. management is very nice.
good,Nice place and managers. Daily tasks are overwhelming but its worth going to work in a friendly atmosphere working hard for a honest company.
good,"Food server. Take orders from customers and serve their food."
good,"Dealing with the public is always challenging; therefore always keeping a positive attitude and keeping your guests happy is the ultimate goal. Problem solving plays another role in the life of a server; not all guests have great experiences, and we want each and every guest to have a great experience; therefore it is up to the server to make this happen. If their food came out cold or is wasn't what they ordered, it is up to the server to make them happy."
good,"It was a wonderful place to work, while in college. Each day, I was taking orders, prepping the orders and cashing out each guest. "
good,I love working with people and multitasking in a fast paced environment. Great experience and just in general a great place to work. Nice co workers and most of the managers are great.
good,"a typical day at work is clocking in and greeting guests as they walk through the door. you also take them to a table to be seated and give them menus so they are ready to order for when the server gets to greeting them. some of my co-workers are rude, and some of them are nice. i help the servers clean their tables and sometimes don't even get a thank you for helping them out. management their is in bad condition. we had a 2 of the 5 manager quit in the past couple of months and recently gotten 2 new managers to replace them. everything is out of control and unorganized at the moment because of that situation."
good,I loved working here. They are very big on working as a team. I learned a lot at this restaurant.
good,"I loved this company! I found it to be very enjoyable training and having a constant change to the menu kept me to have a continued training as well. Meeting and engaging with guests was fun and being able to plan games and incentives including rewards for staff on upsells and contests. And still keeping up with labor, cleanliness, meetings, admisistration."
good,Customers always trying to get free food or not pay or tip there server. Always follow the rules. Far and understandable.Some good days and some bad days. The miscommutcation. Being a positive leader.
good,Learned how to multitask while maintaining a kitchen by following all safety rules and regulations.
good,"A typical day at work consists of greeting tables, taking orders, answering customer questions, ringing up orders in the register, running food, running dish, running drinks, cashing out customers, and cleaning up at the end of your shift."
good,perfected my skills as a general manager. Hopefully got older and wiser.  Loved working with the people and the work I did.
good,"Management staff changed. New management did a terrible job of ""managing"". Used their position to bully employees into doing things their way. Harassed their staff. Our store went from a training store to one that barely scraped the bottom of the barrel so to say. To say the place has gone downhill is an understatement. Many regulars were lost and there were endless complaints about the service and the management staff by guests. Many people who will never return."
good,I Love the fast pace atmosphere of working in a kitchen. The menu is constantly changing and keeping the staff on there toes.
good,"In addition to serving and working in the back of the house I completed my college internship with the company.  I learned about hiring, training and managing employees."
good,"Greeted, waited on and cashed out customers. Interacted well with coworkers, management and guests."
good,Fun atmosphere and people. Very fast paced but little pressure. Above average.
good,Chili's offer a fun work environment with flexible work schedules.
good,"Very typical workplace."
good,"A typical day of work consists of having to maintain peace in the kitchen between servers and cooks. Constantly having to communicate between the two making sure the customer themselves are being served everything they want fresh and fast. I have to make sure all food is cooked to its finest. A lot of the servers would hang around the kitchen, and would have to be forced to serve to their tables. I would go beyond my job and serve the tables myself. Presentation and having a clean surroundings was high on my priority list 100% of the time."
good,"I would come in and get my things ready for my shift."
good,Great work environment and the people were friendly. The mangers were very diverse which helped to create a fun workplace. The hardest part of  the job was keeping everyone happy.
good,Atypical day at work  for me was washing dishes and cleaning tables. The hardest part about this job was dealing with intoxicated customers
good,fun place to work. met new people. nice tips. sampling of new menu items.
good,"9 hours per day, the first job in abroad i learned a lot how to deal with other nationalities, management is awesome and understanding, my co workers were having fun while at work, the hardest thing is you handle 8 tables with 4 tabs, the enjoyable is if your birthday is they making you a surprise which is they put a ketchup in head which fun."
good,A typical day at work was interesting it depended on a certain manager that was there. I've learned a lot of new skills working here which got me into culinary. The management was not to well. I love the General manager though really good guy. The hardest part was at first remember the ingredients but once I got the hang of it I love it. The most enjoyable part of the job was the host very kind people.
good,This job had its ups and downs. Management could have been better but over all it was mostly enjoyable. Crew was great. Employees worked well together.
good,"I was a busboy and a ""bar-back"" (bartender's assistant).  This was my first job and I had a fine experience.  I would recommend Chili's to anyone who is looking for a job in the restaurant industry."
good,"Enjoyable experience, especially with the staff.  As with most restaurants, the average age of waitstaff is in the younger 20's.  It is always fun and upbeat, but can be a little drama arena on some days.  The clientele can be challenging at times.  The pride and satisfaction in the job did win over any negative.  There is very little extra work in addition to the actually waiting on the tables and you can get rewarded to better sections based on performance in turn making you more money.  They are one of the biggest if not the main contributor to St. Jude's and have a month long raise-a-thon that honors this charity.  They also have a lot of charity nights which are usually on Tuesday which help bring in the crowds while supporting good causes.  Friday and Saturday are high volume with wait times, so you can expect to make $100+ those nights."
good,"Everyone should be a server at one time or another. It teaches you how to be a team player, how to treat people and what happens when services are provided to you at a restaurant."
good,"When I got there they were running 15 managers. I used what I learned from Outback and cut them down to 4-5 managers. I became the un official general manager, training the staff in their duties, re writing the training material and updating out of practice procedures. The general manager was always in meeting with the owner who refused to change with the times. This almost destroyed his business. I Took over 3 departments on my own and increased sales by 11% and decreased their labor by 6% saving them money and helping them to achieve the next level of commitment to customer satisfaction. After the ""General manager"" position was offered to an outside source I refused to do the job for them any longer and things began to fall apart. After 2 years of doing the GMs job he had no idea what to do and wanted to become an owner that I could not support. I have since reconciled with him and would work with him again now that I understand it was not him that had the issue but the original owner who would not let him do his job."
good,For those that gave the time and effort Chili's always felt like a family. While the culture has changed with growth it was always somewhere I could go back if needed.
good,"Enjoyed working with the public, Always different each day."
good,"I have worked at Chili's for a year now and while I have heard many mixed reviews about the many different locations, I will say this one is my favorite out of the five restaurants in my experience. My specific location is very busy and respected, the management team, while no where near perfect, have shown true care of their job and the employees. The team of employees, both front and back of the house, are mostly fun and entertaining, yet always focus on the job. The restaurant will lower hours if it feels employees are not up to standards, but at the same time, will overload its better employees with more hours than many of us actually want. The only true issues I have ever had, aside from the day to day problems that plague the food industry, are keeping a management team, keeping employees due to the massive amount of customers and no training program for the back of the house, and maintaining the composure and cleanliness of the restaurant, as many Chilis are old, or ran by employees who provide effective food output, but not the basics of TQ regulations."
good,"Work was laid back, but when it was time to get serious we were all serious about our job. Managers were good. They did what they can when a guest has a complaint. I learned to have respect for others. I had some issues with some of the co-workers, because they did not like to do their job. The hardest part about my job was when a customers food was late and then you had to deal with them griping, and you could just see the look in their face when you told them that their food was gonna be running a little behind. The greatest part of my job was when the babies and children came in because you get to play around with them and watch them giggle and smile. "
good,Great place too work but over staffed which means very little hours
good,"A typical day working at Chili's was serving all different kinds of people. Everyone was there to enjoy the company of their family and friends, and knowing that I could be a great server kept the business flowing. I got to make friends with some customers and staff, very fun place to work and hang out. I learned how to make a bad situation turn out well, and how to have alot of patience with people that had bad attitudes. The hardest part of this job was opening and closing the restaurant with two servers. The most enjoyable part of this job was getting to become friends with the staff."
good,I was able to travel a great deal with Chili's and was moved into management very rapidly.
good,"Hard work but I work with a lot of great people, very fast pace"
good,"at chilis when i arrive in the morning i would have to go sign out and pick up a bank for the day, i would put my money in the draw and start filling up my case and make sure everything was up to date. A typical work day is taking orders making sure every customer has their right order in time enough for their flight. The managers was all great to get along with and they made sure they were around when we needed them."
good,I was a door greeter and host at chilis so on a normal day i would be opening doors for customers and taking them to their seat.I had to learn how to work as a team with my employees so that things would run as smoothly as possible.I had great guidance and relations with all of the managers their which made going to work even better.The hardest part was figuring out how to keep the servers satisfied. You seat them to much their mad you seat them to less their made but wants you get to know everyone you know how much they can handle. The best part of this job was working with a family because thats how I felt about everyone there.
good,"i usually don't come across typical days at work , but when i do there sometimes long days. But while i have been working in different environments i learned how to approach customers & employees. also i adapt to new jobs or assignments fast. My coworkers would say i out-going creative , reliable , respect , caring person."
good,While at chili's I trained newly hired servers and refined my customer service skills. I also bartended two days a week in which I was able to refine efficiency skills by serving drinks to customers as well as preparing drinks for servers in the main dining room.
good,"Short hours, management is good, co workers are friendly, learned about how a restaurant works, meet new people"
good,I get to meet interesting people everyday. The staff is enjoyable to work with.
good,A typical day consisted of helping Brinker employees locate their W-2 forms during tax season. This job really sharpened my problem solving skills.
good,its a fast paced workplace with high stress.
good,Running around a busy environment.
good,"They allowed me to live in Eugene, Oregon, and finish my Bachelor's Degree, so I could get an education. I learned a lot about training employees, Human Resources, and giving back to the community."
good,"For this job being a restaurant job, I would have to say it was one of my most favorite work environments because it was always a great one. The management here was absolutely amazing and they took the time to each me great customer service skills and help me grow as a person. The staff here was absolutely incredible and really made you feel welcome and a part of a family. Rarely would there be a hiccup or a task that I could not handle. It was a fast pace environment that gave me the opportunity to work with many different people."
good,"Chili's was just a typical corporate restaurant, it didnt give you much room to improve or to excel. Co-workers were friendly but not social, servers had their own group, and busboy/hosts had their own. the hardest part of the job as a host was when you had to seat a guest in a section as per their request and the server would be annoyed and mad at you."
good,bussed tables and took dishes to wash as well as serving order to customers and complying to there needs.
good,"I loved working in this type of environment, It was always busy, customers coming and going and sometimes laid over for hours so I would have the table for hours."
good,"For the most part I was a server at Chili's and I would wait on customers as they dined in our restaurant. I would be in charge of a section of tables in the restaurant and would be responsible for every guest that sits at one of my tables. I would run food and drinks out to my tables as well as my co-workers tables. This was a great work environment as we had the opportunity to make what we wanted of our shift by joking around with one another and, at the same time, being as productive as possible. I was also a lead trainer for the serving staff and I would train many of the new employees as well as be there for any of the other employees in their time of need. I would also at time be a manager assistant for a shift where I would control the entire shift and make sure that everything, from food ticket times to customer service, ran smoothly throughout the shift."
good,"Was here for a short time, but enjoyed working for them! I organized tables, greeted customers, made sure everybody was well informed!"
good,Enjoyed this job very much. Good co-workers and managers. Had no complaints working there.
good,"Chilis was a pretty fun place to work, initially. Not always team oriented, however."
good,I personally enjoyed waiting tables. I enjoyed meeting new people every shift and talking to complete strangers dining at my table. When I first became a server I was very shy and timid. Waiting tables made me confident in myself and a more sociable person.The hardest part of working for Chili's was learning the menu. It's a fairly large menu and memorizing what ingredients go with which entrée was quite overwhelming at first.
good,"I'm a waitress so my job is consists of a lot of fast paced, organized chaos. Working in this position for so long has definitely taught me the much needed skill of being a multi-tasker. As a whole, my co-workers and I depend on each other a lot so we're more like a team most of the time, which is extremely important in the restaurant business. My managers are all pretty supportive, but running a restaurant is extremely stressful and it takes a toll on them. The hardest part of my job is dealing with the fact that from week to week or shift to shift, I'm never positive of what I will be walking away with as far as my income. It's hard to budget my life around such an unpredictable salary. The most enjoyable part is that not one single table is like the next. I love that I can have a difficult time with one table, walk 10 feet and have a great time and a totally different experience with the next table. It's a great time because you can be yourself and your personality shines most of the time, but the lack of consistancy as far as making money is hard and not what I need in my life at this point."
good,everything was pretty much good the co-workers was great. the company was good they made sureyou got compensated for your work
good,I would recommend this restaurant as a place to work. Friendly environment.
good,people come to work say its hard to work they become mad or depress but i learn patiences and determination will get you thru the day.Listening to manager carefully and with common sense dont let your co worker become your judge when its so much partys i have to be at all the table quick no breaks the host have to shut down the partys
good,Managers are all very nice and helpful. I love the fact that my job is never the same. I get to meet all kinds of people and brighten up their day. I would say the hardest part of my job some days is when the kitchen is behind and people have to wait a while for there food.
good,Over all working at Chili's kept a professional environment while maintaining a caring atmosphere that made you feel appreciated. Managers were willing to work with you on a situation. Everyone worked very hard at their duties and was willing to help each other.
good,line cook night shift learned lot fry cook very busy cretifed trainer got along with most of the people that worked there management was great working at night going to school in day was part of team lowest
good,Busy workplace with fresh faces daily. I learned the importance of teamwork working here. Management was not the best but flowed. The co-workers became friends! Hardest part was saying good-bye.
good,The most enjoyable part of this job was being able to meet new people every day.
good,Good times and bad times. Days varied based on the customers.
good,"When I worked there it was a fun, young, busy environment with the exception of the management. My hours were cut so i went out and got a 2nd job and informed the management that I still wanted to work here but I could only work nights and weekends, so she scheduled me all day shifts so i couldn't pull any hours at the store, then called me and tried to fire me for no show. Management has changed and the store runs better now and from what I heard this is a great place to work now."
good,Productive and fun work environent that allows me to show my communication skills to the public. It also allows myself to be tested with new and unique situations that occur on a day to day basis. Working in a public work environment can be considered the hardest part of the job on some days but considered the most enjoyable on others. My co-workers and management team work well together and give one another the flexibility needed to deal with everyday life.
good,"great, fun atmosphere. fun exciting people. management was really easy to work with"
good,I worked there for 6 yrs and had seen plenty of managers walk in and out the establishment but the recent GM had good intentions in the beginning but lost the restaurant when he became rude and obnoxious and disrespectful to the employees.I love being a cook just could no longer take it at this establishment.
good,"It was a good company to work for, they encouraged cooks to train on multiple stations. They use a main commissary to prepare soups, and sauces, which keeps everything consistent."
good,Greet and seat guests fun and fast paced work place very interactive. its a neighborhood place as well as getting to see new faces
good,"Management was pretty great, but my coworkers thought they were the ""mean girls,"" and treated everyone that were different than them horribly. Money was decent though."
good,"dia muy activo, ambiente de trabajo muy juvenil y divertido"
good,"Don't expect too much.If they like you, cool. If not, they'll use you until they don't need to anymore. To them, most workers are interchangeable, and there is little loyalty."
good,The holidays at chili’s are rough especially when your partner doesn’t show up. And having to beg for surveys is a joke. Tips are okay if you’re on your game
good,Great place to work fast paced and full of energy. My hours were very flexible and my co workers were very friendly and great to work with. I would definitely work here again.
good,"Un poco pesado, y rápido. Conoces mucha gente. Capacitación rápida, contratación rápida."
good,Despite some cohesion issues with management team it was fun.
good,"It was alright working there. The employees were good to work with but most of the managers were not very good. They have since changed managers, so not sure how it is now."
good,"During the week it was normally slow, once it hit Thursday and on until about Sunday we were steady/busy.. some days I thought to myself I wouldn't be able to handle this but then I got the hang of it all and it's really just a mind thing. you cannot let the heat run you away. I learned that no matter how chaotic it can get working in the food industry which it can, just breathe and move at a steady pace so you dont get to ahead of yourself. You will mess up, you will drop a tray or a drink. it happens"
good,"Chili's focused on the wrong promotions. Instead of focusing on their fajitas, ribs, and burgers, which are more expensive items on the menu, they decided to focus on more sale/promotional items that didn't really bring in the right crowd to Chili's, and this crowd does not necessarily like to tip either."
good,"I personally enjoyed my job there. Were there things that they could do to improve their work environment, of course, but it was a great first job. I do wish that they worked with my schedule more because I really enjoyed my job there."
good,Chilis is ok. Workers seemed to have a lot of drama with them. It's crazy. I'm good without having Chilis in my life daily though. If I want Chilis...and I love their food...I will order to go. Where its drama free.
good,chili's is a team working job they are really great people if the pay was worth all the work i wouldn't mind. but they are not paying enough plus no overtime my hrs are short just not a good fit for me
good,I used various types of equipment working in the resteraunt industry. Still have all ten of my fingers. Can't stand as long as I used to. Better working alone. Not much of a people person.
good,"i overall enjoyed my experience working for chilis,it was a great job to get into. i didnt have any management complaints til i had to leave then felt as if it were a bad idea."
good,Used to be a lot better but they changed management and people stopped caring as much so morale went down throughout. Still can make money though and not a hard menu with big table sections
good,"I started off in flat-top, learning all the recipes for that area, and once I was proficient I moved on to the next area, deep-fry, and once I was proficient with that, I moved on to the next area. I got a raise when I learned different areas of the kitchen, so management is reasonable to negotiate with."
good,I am currently still working at chillis and if you are looking for quick money weekly I would recommend working at chilis. They are flexible with hours.
good,"The managers aren’t the best, but the atmosphere there was awesome. The people were more like a family than a company. Work might not be the best but if you have great people around it’s not so bad"
good,"Ha sido mi primer trabajo y he aprendido muchas cosas que me han servido para comprender y saber administrar un poco más mis tiempos, además de estar siempre al tanto de la gente que estoy atendiendo para asegurarme de que nada les falte y asegurarme de que se lo estén pasando bien. Si bien al inicio no me llevaba bien con algunos compañeros del trabajo por ser nueva precisamente, fui lidiando con ello porque sé que todo mundo pasa por eso, pero sí hacía difícil para mí el integrarme con mis compañeros. Lo que me gusta del trabajo es cuando tengo la oportunidad de llevarme bien con la mesa que atiendo y me deja buena propina, así como también me gusta cuando mis compañeros y yo hacemos buen equipo y nos apoyamos mutuamente, siendo solo con unos cuantos con los que logro eso. Los gerentes no son perfectos pero hacen bien su trabajo."
good,"I enjoy working at chili’s for the most part. This can be a fast paced environment, but also slow days as well. Management is good for the most part, but certainly there are times when they get burnt out and it shows to all the other employees. This is a profession with a high employee turnover rate and many call offs, that can be discouraging for employees as well. If you are willing to work the hours, you can make good money, but you will work hard for it."
good,Chili's is a nice start up job for anyone. it's an easy way to make quick money and some times you might even make a new friend. It's a place where it's not hard to replace you at all but as long as you work hard and stay focused you'll be good at it. As far as the management it all depends on which location you're at. Don't allow Chili's to be you're forever job.
good,Good money and a great place to work and meet new people... very stressfull at times but overall my experience was great. I would recommend working there if you want quick money
good,"The chilis I'm at pays quite a bit more than local minimum wage, but the job duties and expectations are a bit ridiculous. Breaks are absolutely not guaranteed unless it slows down, and even then there's something that needs to be done, and at one of the top 10 chilis by sales volume and service in the country, where I am now, it generally never slows down. The managers are always quick to tell you if you step outside even for two minutes to breathe that you're wasting time and they can be quite rude about it. Multitasking to the extreme, and customers can get extremely unrealistic. Managers tend to come down hard on even simple things, and most people I know are looking for elsewhere to work, due to the fact that there is very little time off to take care of family and personal matters. Coworkers can be toxic and it just leads to more general chaos."
good,"I say so because the review is mandatory but my experience at Chili's is not indicative of what I believe the company culture to truly be.  The location I managed  (part-time) was under a franchise ownership change, and I don't want that turmoil to deter any applicants to what I believe is a solid company with a fun and rich culture.  Carry on."
good,"Fridays and Saturdays were always super busy in the afternoons, it was kind of slow Monday through Wednesday. It was faced paced, but i definitely enjoyed the team i was working with."
good,"Chili's may not be the biggest name in dine-out experiences, but of places I've worked none kept me longer than this one, I would still be working there under different circumstances."
good,"Assisted with food prep, serving food taking orders, an costumer care.  Billing, discounts, an assisted with training new workers.  I learned how to work with other workers who helped back."
good,"I have had a very enjoyable time at working at Chili's. It is full of fun people and hard working managers. Sometimes it can get a bit hectic because of the amount of customers that come in, but the helpfulness of the employees can make it a lot less stressful."
good,it pays the bills I guess workers are cool most mangers hit and miss but it puts food on table I don't know really what to say other than good luck I guess
good,Very hard to have a work life balance. Every manager is required 50-55 hours per week and is rarely given any weekend off to be with family and friend unless planned 8 weeks prior.
good,I've had some good experiences and bad experiences working at Chili's but overall a great place to work. A nice clean environment you get 50% off of your food if you're an employee
good,Great Working there if you want a  job thats flexible and make good money everyday. Ability to request off more days than a usual job. The food is good
good,management lock themselves away and do not take the time or make the effort to help shift run efficiently they do not care that customers are rude and abusive to their staff they expect you to work 16 hours everyday and do not make cuts as needed
good,Un dia laboral consistia en atender a personas desde primera hora y hacerlos irse con un buen sabor de boca.
good,"Worked at a few different locations. Most managers were willing to help and make sure your day was easy. "
good,"Chili's was a fast-paced work environment, which I liked. I enjoyed interacting with customers and my co-workers for the most part. There were the occasional problems (like every job has) but overall the staff and management were nice. We all worked hard to give the best service possible. "
good,"Chilli's was for the most part, a very fun and exciting place to Work, the employees are professional and hard working. Management was out going and chilli's is a family ."
good,Good for a short time or extra money. How did the job alot the culture of the company was great especially around the summertime. However the management seems to be very selfish with hours but they're  not wanting to give anyone over than 35 hours a week.
good,"Working at Chili's was fun experience. I learned  a lot there. I would work there again, the only thing that I didn't like was the long hours, I was not able to keep up with the double shifts."
good,"productive and keeps you busy,everyone works together well and very sweet and kind hearted.the manager makes you feel like family when you first start very helpful and continues to help you till you understand the concept of what your doing."
good,"It's a very laid back job, sure it gets busy on weekends but other than that it was a very laid back environment with a fun and upbeat staff. It's not a forever job but certainly isn't a bad part-time gig."
good,Although fast paced it was very enjoyable. Thats due to the great vibes and energy provided by the co-workers. By far one of my favorite jobs. Great staff and awesome managers.
good,chilis was a fast paced work environment but the overall work experience was fun and a really fun place to have as my first job and i was also treated well and well paid.
good,"Aunque di todo de mi potencial, pues nunca e permitido que mi discapacidad visual sea un obstaculo, lamentablemente en chilli's no fue así. fuí discriminada por  mi vision y inclumplieón con mi acomodo razonable . Solo me daban 2 dias de trabajo y dos horas de trabajo."
good,"Good place to get an introduction into the restaurant business, great general manager, but there are two guys that bully all the others and should be fired. Some waiters are very weak, and freak out easily, but it's Chili's so not a whole lot can be expected. Beginning work is prefaced with a lot of warnings about mean or inefficient waiters."
good,"Chili's really opened my eyes and I met a lot of great servers with huge personalities. From there, they helped me build the skills I needed to expand"
good,With the exception of a few people and an angry manager I absolutely loved and looked forward to going to work with my co-workers and also seeing my favorite customers.
good,"usually under staffed, working harder to make up for the lack of help, over worked, poor communication, servers have bad attitudes, food prep runs low during dinner rush."
good,"Although I don’t receive many hours I do like how we try to help each other as much as we can. Managers always come out to help whenever servers, cooks or whoever needs help."
good,"fun workplace, fun staff, relaxed management. I liked working there and I would like to work there again. It was also fun dealing with the customers. I made and ran into many friends at Chili's."
good,"Chili's was fine-- they were pretty accommodating with host hours, they paid $11 hourly which isn't terrible, management was okay, but the environment was kind of catty and I was yelled at by servers for mistakes. Also, if you're a host and have no previous serving experience, it's almost impossible to get any sort of promotion."
good,"A typical day at work is taking orders, delivering food, and cleanup at the end of shift. Great job to work while in college or as a second job. Ended up quitting because of the local management at the time but I made some good friends. Stressful work because you're on your feet and moving quick, but you get that with any serving job."
good,Working with a company that sets a very clear standard we were trained to give 100 percent customer service and high quality of dining experience with warm and cozy atmosphere.
good,"A typical day was prepping  work station for food "
good,I would work there again! It was a good experience. My co-workers were eventually more then willing to lend a helping hand and help learn new things. The menu did not have a overwhelming amount of recipes to memorize.
good,Working here wasn’t too bad but your section is based on your ziosk reviews which usually only complained about kitchen taking too long or not tasting good not really based on server
good,"good place, just wish they had more staff, everyone is always working 2 shifts a day and it does get tiring being on your feet all the time. Good food."
good,"Pretty fun environment, just looking for a place I could make more money. The avg ticket is around $35 and I can’t afford to be working so much and not make enough to live! Also want to try something new"
good,I enjoyed my time working there because the staff made it feel like a home away from home. The management team was easy to communicate with and staff members were always helpful to one another.
good,"pretty steady paced.  Made decent money.  LOTS of sidework, running dishes and sorting silver ware were the worst.  co workers were nice and everyone helps each other."
good,"I love working here, they also work with your schedule. Management is very understanding and are willing to let you have flexible hours. Staff and management are polite. it has its busy days and slow days as well"
good,"It was interesting working here. There were some slow moments, but it is mostly fast-paced and keeping a smile on your face is important. You are expected to help with bussing tables, but there is no sharing of tips from the servers, even on busy evenings where a large portion of the bussing is completed by the host."
good,"It's a fun fast pace place to work that can have it's slow moments. When it's busy, you make good money. It is a team environment,  but the schedule can be inconsistent. I like how the servers share sections and help one another so we all know how to host, do dishes, and expo food. It gets busy, which  can become stressful, but not all the time. Can be a bit repetitive and tedious overtime but great place to make money. Will become difficult as you get older due to long periods of standing up, lifting heavy treys, and cleaning work."
good,"You take care of your guests. Get their drinks, take their food, provide excellent customer service, keep your area clean, and make the correct change whenever they pay you for their bill."
good,"As a Server at Chilis, I provided excellent customer service by ensuring customer orders are provided as expected with a positive and friendly attitude. In an effort to increase sales, recommend additional foods and beverages to broaden customer interest and orders."
good,"definitely not for the faint of heart, one must be ready to deal with a high volume situation. The amount you earn and the friendships you can build with your team make it worth it though."
good,"I liked working at Chilis because it was fast money. The tips would end up adding day by day and the staff worked well together. However, some days were way much busier than others and if everyone was not on the same page, the shift would t go so great."
good,"Cool job fast working, friendly people good times. Allows you to have good availability. Not to hash fun managers, free food when you train people. Relaxed at times"
good,"Chili’s is a great place to make easy money while establishing a customer base. Positive people, but fast paced. People want their food out when it’s hot!"
good,When busy it was a great place to work and time flew by but when it would slow down people got sent home early. Really this didn't provide a livable wage for the servers except the ones who had been there for a long time and were able to be openers and closers.
good,I loved working at Chilis but there was a lack of team work and there was no recognition for the workers who done their job properly. There were workers who would not do their side work that caused others to do more than they should have.
good,"Working at Chilies was difficult but worth all of the hard hours. I felt like I was helping and actually doing something 24/7 and although the servers could dial down their tempers some of the time, they were very grateful for the hosting staff and all they did."
good,"A typical day at Chilis consisted of waiting a 3 to 4 table section or bartending behind the bar with one other employee and waiting on 20 to 25 people at a time."
good,"A typical day at work was fast paced and overall fun, but at moments would become very intense. There was a strong and positive workplace culture. The management was effective at achieving high district ratings but often treated certain workers unethically while treating others very well unrelated to the persons work performance."
good,"I would come in , check to see what zone I would be in to serve. I learned that taking care of the customer is the best outcome of success. the culture was fun especially when games were on."
good,"I got stuck as the catch all. I did to-go and prep and QA. They wouldn't let me be a server and didn't give me my raise because I ""wasn't meeting my job qualifications"" when they had changed the qualifications with out telling me. It took them six months and three people to replace what I was doing for them."
good,"My review may be biased as I worked in Hawaii Chilis which is a franchise. Overall a great job, pay was competitive work hours were long though. I would definitely still work there if I still lived on the island."
good,"Working at Chili's was fun, the hours & customers were just to taxing on a person mentally. The staff & management are great though. The feeling of being apart of something bigger is really felt."
good,"Gained valuable experience as you are able to see customers of various ethnics. Also learned to multi-task during rush hours waiting tables, bussing tables and sending food."
good,"Fast paced, challenging, and collaborative. The tasks typically do not go beyond your position, so you're not stretched thin. Sharpens your communication with both front of house employees and back of house employees."
good,"Chili's is the perfect fit for someone who is young and wants to work hard.  The quote, ""You reap what you sow"" is very fitting.  It is a fun place to work and friends will be made.  It isn't rocket science but it can be tough if you only think of yourself."
good,The people were amazing to work with.
good,and lovely environment. You can make money as long as you put forth the effort.  It was always busy on weekends so the oppurtunities are always presenting themselves.
good,"I worked at Chili's while I was in high school and college.  I was pretty good at my job as a server, so I made decent tips.  However, I now need to seek full time employment."
good,Working at Chilis gave me the face to face customer service experience that has helped me so much throughout my previous jobs. Customer service is (at times) the backbone of some companies.
good,Chili's is a great place to work great management I have learned a lot in the food industry I would go back but at my age I need good benefits and a for sure job
good,"Was my first job while i was in highschool, and it was a pretty decent one to have while in school as the management did its best to work with me. Overall a good place to work."
good,"Management was great and very accomodating. Other staff was friendly and cool. Very fast paced at times. Not long hours. Sidework is minimal, and opening and closing duties don't take hours to complete."
good,"I enjoy working at Chili's, at least at my location. They usually work with your schedule and you can make good money if your attitude is positive. You may get burned out on serving if you are not careful, but I do not, for the most part, have anything negative to say."
good,"I worked at Chili's while I was in school. It was the best part time job that I could ask for. The managers worked with my schedule, and I was able to make a decent living while only working 20-25 hours a week. I would recommend it."
good,"When I first started I felt like I was back in high school. The co-workers were rude and liked to spread rumors. I stuck around and eventually they came to like me. As for the actual job; if you can serve at Chili's, you can serve anywhere. It's fast paced and crazy. You will be on your toes! When I was there the managers were nice but I believe they have new ones now."
good,"Did not love my job but it payed the bills. Depending on your location, it can be great. Some managers are very helpful but others are too focused on the numbers and not what makes people great servers."
good,Working here I learned how to have a good time while making money. I learned that not everything has to be serious and that sometimes people just need someone to smile at them to brighten their day.
good,Productive and challenging workplace. A lots of trainings which is good for the staffs. Classrooms every week. And I had really fun working with them. Good communication
good,Es bueno pero te aburren muy rápido trabajas bien te va bien pero si falta un poco más de cuidado en elegir al personal y trabajar en el don de gente
good,Employee's were always easy to get along with. No one judged you. You could always make friends easily because you always felt welcomed at your job when you arrived for your shift.
good,"its a fast paced job, but is easy once you get your duties down.  I would recommend to anyone just trying to get their foot in the door, and make some extra cash on the side.  Not really a good career choice unless going into management."
good,Pretty great place to be a dishwasher. Great discounts and  good pay. Some nights are better than otherwise but that's to be expected. Working alone is tough at first but you get used to it after a while. You're pretty much the captain of your own ship in the dishpit.
good,The location in which you work has heavily to do with the type of work you will expect but the company itself offers lots of incentives and is very involved with their team.
good,There is usually one Manager one at a time so you are in charge of running the front of house and back of house while being able to solve any problems
good,"I worked with a lot of great people. I waited on a lot of wonderful people and made some great friendships. It was a stressful work environment and kept you on your toes but if you work hard, it paid.. Literally."
good,As a dishwasher you work by yourself. You have to be very quick and are very good at detail when it comes to cleaning. The work load can be very stressful if you cant keep up. However you can take a short break and help somebody else out in the kitchen.
good,The stronger the management team and better accountability and alignment will result in a higher performing restaurant. Training does not seem to be very effective.
good,Work is good its in a fast pace and critical thinking usually to over come obstacles.we follow directions and also health rules like washing hands and avoiding cross contimantion.
good,"Good people.  Good job.  Not a good work life balance as being in the food industry and in order to make money, you have to work many shifts.  The food industry works the people hard and not many benefits are given to the employees who make 2.13 per hour."
good,"Each and every day was different. I knew that I would have to do my job at a fast pace, while staying friendly, but I never knew what to expect while working for Chili's."
good,it was fast paced and great learning experience. the tips were good some night some times they weren't. mangers were very helpful and helped me catch on very quick.
good,"Good place to work at but, can make you feel underutilized "
good,"On a typical day at Chili's I would do any side work that needed to be done. Once a customer/customers would come in I would rush over to seat them and give them their menus. That restaurant could become super busy so I would work with another host on very busy days. I learned how to roll silverware, where to seat customers based on the rotation that I had to follow. The managers were really nice and focused on their jobs. I think they made really good managers at Chili's. Most of my co-workers were very nice and easy to be around. The hardest part of my job was driving to a job that was too far away from where I live. The most enjoyable part of my job was singing happy birthday to the birthday customers."
good,Very productive fast-paced company that treats their employees with respect. Rewards their employees for a great job. Give bonuses and discounts. There is room for advancement if you play to good old boy games.
good,"Serving teaches patience and humility, and working at chili's you will learn them both. While your serving good food in a nice atmosphere, your location is key. My location happened to be in a less than ideal part of Philadelphia, so while I was able to make a decent penny with my elite skills, most where pulling in scraps."
good,"Chilis is not a bad place to work. The servers are very friendly and the managers are kind to everyone. Chilis is usually very busy or very slow with very little days in-between. The only complaint I have is the ITR system. On our ziosks, which is how we are supposed to encourage our guests to check out, there is an option for a survey. Unfortunately, most people do not fill the survey out unless they are angry. Everyone's scores is averaged and the amount of shifts you receive is based on your score. If you look at the chart of scores however, the more responses you have, the lower the score generally is. It is also near impossible to bring up your score once they cut your hours."
good,I enjoyed working for this company. I became pregnant while working here two times (two pregnancies) and they were very flexible and worked with me .....
good,una empresa que invierte mucho en capacitaciones y mejoras para el servicio al cliente y en la vida personal. los sueldos son bajos pero las propinas son muy bien remuneradas.
good,Chili's was not a bad place to work. I stayed here for two years. My only real complaint was that i had 5 different sets of managers in my two years there. The money was decent and the environment was pretty laid back
good,I loved the atmosphere at chili's and everyone there worked as a team. I had awesome coworkers and the managers were always willing to help us when it was busy.
good,It's a good place to work but it can be a little stressful. The management is the only problem that is only problem I've seen. But there are some good changes coming.
good,"A typical day of work at Chili’s is entertaining. What I've learned working there, is leadership and self motivation. The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with guests."
good,"Wash dirty dishes, silverware and cup's run them threw the dishwasher and then put dishes on the rack. separate silverware and put up cups............"
good,Worked here for a good year a good place to work and always available for advancement. Also if you have experience a good place to more up fast. Cooking and customer service skills necessary.
good,I worked for the company on and off for 8 plus years. Awesome environment. Spot on food safety. Management really try to help employees.  Employees enjoy what they do
good,"See to the day to day operations of the restaurant.  kept to standard of  cleanliness, food safety. Budget controllable cost daily. "
good,"This job is intense and high energy when it comes to the weekends! You get lots of military customers and about 30% local families. You'll have days when it's so slow that you'd love for a 20 person party to walk through that door and there are days where you wish you didn't have 12 tables at this second, all asking for different things."
good,"This job consist of managing on a daily basis, which includes not only foh but also boh. The job also consist of running a ongoing P&L and keeping track of ordering and running a successful business. I have been at this job for 19 years and I am currently looking for a job that will guarantee and solid income while being able to have a good home life."
good,I learned a lot about customer service while here and i was fortunate to have a manager that was so mindful of all his employees. Was fun to work in a college town as well.
good,"It serving not a career. But a fun job nevertheless. It depends on what location one works at. Depending on that you may make money, but if in a less socioeconomic area there isn't much to be made"
good,I have worked many years and have never learned as much from a group of managers. The management team was always willing to find teachable moments no matter if the lesson was within an employee's job description or not. I not only learned my job very well but learned many things about the business that wasn't necessarily my job.
good,Friendly atmosphere good environment potential to make great money must be able to multitask and work well with others .
good,"es un negocio emprendedor, con facilidades de establecer horarios, aprendí a trabajar en equipo,lo dificil del trabajo es que se necesita mas personal"
good,This was my first serving job. I gained a lot of experience here. The management work well with me being that I am student. Co-Workers were all willing help and work as a team. I would love to grow with this company.
good,"El trabajo  y la empresa a mi me gustaba mucho, el único problema es que pagan poquito ."
good,This was a very fun place to work with a lot of amazing co workers. Most of the managers were nice but their are some that were not as good and didn't work with my school schedule.
good,"It was a typical job, there were a tiring days. But overall it was fun, I'd learned alot. The management were strict enough but in terms of discipline. Hardest part when handling a difficult guest, the most irritable the guest enter our store, but it was fulfilling when they came out of the store smiling and satisfied with the food and service given to them."
good,"As bad as I thought this job was, looking back at it now this job wasn't half bad. This job helped me pay rent, pay my bills, and buy a new car."
good,Waiting on customers.  To be patient with everyone.  The most enjoyable part was working with the food and my co workers.  The hardest part was cleaning up at the end of the night.
good,Each location has a different experience but the overall company has a great concept of introducing fresh food to new recipes.
good,"Typical day started at 7 am, check lists, receive morning orders, place orders, set up prep list, check schedules and set up floor plans, answer phone calls. Learned a good deal about P&L, and MOPL statements. Upper management had an identity crisis about which direction to go, family style, or bar/casual dining. I had great group of employees, which always made coming in to work a good thing. Hardest part was getting a phone call at 4:00 from someone scheduled for 5:00 and having to find a replacement for them, while you are trying to finish your day and go home."
good,Good place to work at when you are atteneding school. Very flexible with everyones schedule. Fast pace and great way to make money
good,aprendi a ser super rapido en la cocina a ser ordenado  a trabajar con respeto y con limpieza
good,"Gained experience in restaurants and learned how they operated ""behind the scenes"". Fast paced environments and friendly staff. Easy to gain experience in different parts of the kitchen."
good,"I will say that serving was probably the hardest job I have ever done, but it was also the best money I have ever made in the food business. Team work was a plus. We were a team when I worked there."
good,"always busy and I love it. Costumer service, making drinks, serve food, quality check for the food. "
good,"Chili's management team worked with my college schedule. Whenever I had exams coming up, or a group assignment, they were always willing to work with my chaotic available hours. My co-workers were wonderful, and always willing to help as well."
good,"This job allows you to make a lot of money or very little money.  Management is wishy washy, some managers enforce policy, others could care less.  If you do not have a family this is the job for you because they will work you to the bone if you are an asset,"
good,"On a typical work day i would go in and make chips, then prepare any food that came in an order, i learned how to make a meal presentable and how to prepare food to be ready to cook. The management was pretty good, they helped clean the kitchen at the end of the day and would help make orders when we were swamped. The coworkers were alright, they were fun to be around on certain days and others they were focused. The hardest part of the job was trying to keep up with all the orders during holidays when some of the employees were out sick, and the most enjoyable part of the job was being able to cook because I like to cook."
good,The company was great to work for and I did learn a ton in my time with them. The area director their was a great mentor especially for a young guy just starting out.
good,Arrive at restaurant 30 minutes before opening. extremely long hours due to customers entering business at closing time. The hardest part of the job was the constant turn over of employees.
good,at work i was working so hard its a very good company it has good food it also has good services i learn pretty fast i am responsible when the manager tells me to do something il do it
good,"Resturants are all the same. The stress, pay, and hours to not always add up. However, if good at the job the money is great."
good,"I loved being a server and a bartender! Mixing up drinks and making new recipes of margaritas or whatever our new special was for the month was my favorite. I enjoyed when customers asked for me to serve them and sit in my section, that make me feel great. To me that showed that I have given them excellent customer service prior to that visit. I loved interacting with guests and hearing how their day was and the stories they would tell.  "
good,I enjoyed my experiences at Chili's.  I was able to meet new people and gain some confidence in the work environment.  I'd come in to work and make sure my area was clean and well stocked.  My co-workers were all friendly and I enjoyed each work day.  All management that I came across were all professionals and handled any workplace issues promptly and fairly.  The hardest part of my job was standing for hours.  I remedied that by staying busy walking the floor and making sure things were neat and tidy.  I enjoyed seeing all the friendly faces.
good,"Great staff and great management, not so great clientele. Extremely flexible and accomidating work schedule. The management genuinely cares about their employees and wants to see them succeed as individuals and as a team."
good,"When I worked for Chili's I felt there was a good work/life balance for me at the time.  There was a lot of incentive to do well to get to the next level.  These incentives included promotion and monetary rewards, which are always motivating."
good,"Great stepping stone while looking for a career.  It provides you the necessary time to go to interviews take time off when necessary.  If your  focus is restaurant management it is a great company to work for.  It has numerous locations across the country, If looking for a new career it provides real world experience with face to face customer sales in a dynamic and changing environment."
good,it was more slower paced then other retruants i worked at i really did not learn anything i did not already accomidate on my ow. i love ooking so anytime im just coooking is enjoyable job for me
good,I enjoyed the company and the people who worked for it. like all big company's there are things that need to be change so make things better
good,"A typical day at work is checking the station and the prep. When the clock strikes 11am, orders will start to ring in. "
good,"Atypical day at work included walking in and start working, There was always something to do. Greeting guests, taking them to tables, refills, running food, answering the phone, pouring drinks, running drinks, pre bussing, wiping tables down, running dish. "
good,"The job has a fairly laid back environment, with very nice coworkers, however the managers are a little to nice they never scold anyone or tell anyone what they are done to allow them to improve. Even if you do improve there are no raises as it is a severing/shift leading job and it is difficult to move up past shift leading in the company. The hardest part about the job is grumpy customers but that is inevitable  in any job. Ive learned its all about how you react and take action with a grumpy customer, they should always leave happy if at all possible."
good,"•	Stocked cabinets and serving areas with condiments, and refilled condiment containers as necessary. "
good,"Good time working there, however I wouldn't go back.  Pay is horrid, absolutely rely on tips.  Management as sort of lacking."
good,"A typical day at this establishment starts with going there a little early to have time to eat the employee meal before the shift starts. Once the shift starts, it all depends on the flow of customers that come in. Some days, it can be slow so work is easy; other days, it can be packed so work can be a bit stressful. But a busy day does equal more money. Also, depending on who your coworkers and manager for that day are, it can mean the difference between a busy day flowing smoothly or being a wreck."
good,Always had a blast with my crew mates. Decent tips and just a blast to work!
good,"Chili's was where I first started serving.  It was a good college job and while stressful, the money was decent and coworkers were amicable.  Like any restaurant, there was always drama but for the most part, it was a decent job."
good,Some equipment not up to par.Daily did the prep work then on line did fryers etc.management not up to par.
good,"Every location I worked at there was something new to learn, but the culture that was Chili's always created a fun working environment. Everyday it was required to do closing duties, fill things as the shift went along, clear tables, and work with guests. Sometimes the hardest part of the job was working with the guests, other days it was a walk in the park. Sometimes the most enjoyable part of the job was working with the guests, and sometimes it was knowing that you were going to be working with a well-liked manager, or a group of people that you knew you were going to have a blast with. I learned to work hard, even though sometimes you were going to be the one working harder than most. I learned how to be fast on my feet and how to multitask."
good,"Knowledgeable about the restaurant’s menus, food and beverage items and other products."
good,Working here was a lot of fun and they took very good care of us all the time. They were slow to promote but took a lot of care with their decisions
good,"The management was low-quality, but the workplace was decent. Pay levels were above average, but there was little room for advancement."
good,"I'd work there again if I was in Texas, but being I'm in California, it's a must I continue to follow my passion for food and food quality."
good,"Fun working environment , challenges with team members, team building experiences"
good,"Chilis in Jupiter, FL was a great place to work at.  The managers were friendly and helpful. I learned how to run the floor.  It was a very tight knit place. We all got along really well."
good,"My typical workday consisted of customer service and satisfaction. I served customers their food and beverages, inspected proper food preparation, and trained fellow employees on proper procedure. Being one of many food service industry jobs, I was fairly familiar with  the way things should be done. However, ever restaurant is different, and I had to learn the way the company operated. I enjoyed working with my fellow employees. I learned from them, and they learned from me. The most difficult part of working in the service industry is the long hours. Often, we were on our feet for 12 to 14 hours at a time. However, at the end of the day, the money was worth the long hours."
good,GREAT place to work and have fun!! Not really anything else to say. Management changed right when i left.
good,"They are good company to work for, but only give benefits to full time employees so even if you work there twenty years and you are part time you receive no vacation pay."
good,"Chili's is a great place to work for a teenager or young adult, has amazing food at amazing prices with a great group of employees and management. The pay and hours depends on how hard you work and your availability to be able to move up in the company."
good,A typical day would start slowly but gradually pick up the pace. I learned how to deal with different types of customers. My management changed a few times but we all got along and did our jobs. My co-workers were fun and very helpful. The hardest part was juggling between happy and angry customers but it wasn't impossible. I loved working with my team members. They were a blast.
good,"Come in and get to work right away because there are tons of dishes,etc waited for me because there is no one during the day. I enjoy the job and my co-workers"
good,"1.) At typical day at Chili's begins very slowly. Once business begins to pick up, usually, the restaurant remains steady for the entire night, until close to closing hours."
good,"Overall it was a simple task to be a line cook. You had to learn to prep, clean, organize, cook, and plate in a fast paced manner. I enjoyed getting to know the back of house crew members and became a highly useful tool in the kitchen. Cooking has always been a passion and I learned a good amount of knowledge as far as safety and providing something to every dish."
good,"a pesar de que es una empresa grande se descuida mucho al sector de cocina , aculando trabajo es por esa razón que en muchas ocasiones las personas que trabajan en esta área no permanecen y el sueldo es menor,no hay incentivos para la gente de cocina y los riegos laborales del mismo trabajo deben ser evaluados y controlados"
good,Had a good time working at Chilis. Liked most of my co-worker and cliental. Managers were good too.
good,Chili's is a great company to work for with the potential for advancement. It is a fun environment and if you can give great customer service you have the potential to make a lot of money. It isn't ideal for a single mother however. I had to work lots of split shifts in order to make decent money.
good,I took customers orders and put them into the computers promptly. I brought them their drinks and made sure they were never empty. When their food was ready I double checked to make sure it was correct and brought it out to them. I always smiled and tried to make dining out fun and special. I liked serving tables because of the flexible hours and the cash tips.
good,"Deal with people on a daily bases. I learned how to be a waitress and how to be more of a people person, also how to make multiple sales with alcoholic beverages and such. The management team makes it a good work place. They take care of bad situations when needed and make sure the guests food and experience in the restaurant went well. I love my co-workers. They all make it very fun, and when your having a bad day they make it better. The hardest part of the job is when having to deal with guests who are not happy and trying to make them happy, or when people make mistakes on your orders and do not tell you so you can fix them before they go out to your tables. I think the most enjoyable part of the day is when you know you've made someones day better by doing a great job."
good,"love the job love customer service, its my specialty. although management sucked i still loved my job duties."
good,"A typical day was getting prep completed using a prep sheet to calculate what needs to be made and how much."
good,"Typical day: waiting on and serving tables... each employee works with a partner and has a certain section of the restaurant. There are times when you may have whole section to your self. I learned how to prioritize, move quickly, memorize orders, be personable and friendly while serving customers. Hardest part of the job was long hours on your feet, and most enjoyable part was giving each customer a pleasant and great experience while they come out to enjoy a meal."
good,"I cook food for the patrons of Chilis. This job has taught me leadership amidst teamwork, how exceed under pressure, how to coordinate with coworkers, productive multitasking, and clear communication."
good,A typical day at chili's is kind of hectic depending on the time of the month and or year. There's a lunch rush and things get busy then it slows down but dinner time there's another rush during Monday- Thursday is usually not so busy but Friday-Sunday is where it gets really busy. Management on really busy days and nights is all over the place but for the most part the managers were good. My co-workers they were pretty cool I only got to know a few of them the others they really didn't bother with me much unless it had something to do with the seating arrangements.
good,I went to work and made my hours .Did what I had to do then went home.
good,"A typical day at work includes, checking in with a manager and the hosts to make sure everyone knows your there and on time. Check out your tables to make sure they are clean and ready for business when you get sat. As the tables come in its time to get busy with upselling, suggesting, multi-tasking, serving food, keeping the guest entertained and satisfied wanting to come back just to see you. I then finish the day with doing my closing duties, checking everyone else out, turning in the money owed to the restaurant and double checking everything on my way out."
good,"Most enjoyable part of the job was feeling like a family away from home. Typical day of work consisted of working with some great customers who included regulars that would come to sit in my section, learned a lot about how to deal with people who sometimes were upset if the kitchen messed up their order but for the most part was a decent place to work."
good,Fast-pace work environment friendly atmosphere. This is a where young adults can gain very important customer relations skills and jobs skills.
good,"fast paced during rush hrs but good environment and co-workers. I learned customers can be really nice or really bad. management was good to me I was a hard worker above and beyond. hrs were flexible. was a good 2nd job. Sometimes the money was poor, needed more secure income."
good,a typical day at chilis is busy and very fast pace. i have learned how to multi-task very well. management is in the process of getting better. the co-workers are very friendly and hard working. 
good,"performance based pay, the more you learn the more you get paid there is no limit on raises per year. "
good,I have been working for chili's for 9 years now and enjoy the job itself. A wonderful place to make money and meet some different and awesome people. Really hard to move up into management from within. 
good,"Working at Chili's has had its ups and downs.  I have made a lot of great friends and enjoyed many of the guests who I have served.  The downside to my particular store is that it is mismanaged and my coworkers and I become easily frustrated.  Management has allowed some of their favorite employees to run the store while they sit in the office.  They do not accept our requests for time off and there have been instances where coworkers were scheduled on their graduation days although they requested off months in advance.  Likewise, there have been cases where my managers have put salt in their employers drinks and even gone through an employees cell phone while they were not looking.  In large corporations, it is easy for situations like these to be overlooked, especially if an employee is nervous about reporting these cases to HR.  Chili's can be a great place to work however, I would never recommend this particular store to a friend.  "
good,"Brinker is probably one of the best corporations in the restaurant industry. This company has taught me a great deal about consolidation, time management and customer service. Like all F&B jobs the schedule is unpredictable but you definitely cannot complain about being bored or the ""same ole routine"" because things are ever changing. At times I found it difficult to truly understand the reasoning behind certain company wide initiatives however Brinker has a knack for hiring exceptional supervisors who are highly capable of getting employees ""on boards"" with the newest...and some times oldest...policies. "
good,"* Great staff "
good,I have learned more about customer service and the harm that any negative energy can bring to a customer service venue. I enjoy the teamwork environment and the spirit of making the consumer the priority.
good,The work environment is really great here. You make really great money and they promote from within. You can start off doing one job and if you let someone know that you are interested in another they will train you towards that job. This was probably one of my favorite jobs.
good,"A very chill and laidback environment. Fast paced and hectic at peek hours but overall shifts ran pretty smoothly, I rarely had any complaints about management, most were usually on top of things. This job helped me to excel in time management, teamwork, and giving great customer service at all times The hardest/ most irritating part of the job was drama. Since the majority of chili's employees ranges from teenagers to college students, drama is hard to avoid on most shifts. Oh and of course, my least favorite part was rolling silverware. The most enjoyable part of working at chili's was having a good time with fellow employees and leaving with a pocket full of that days hard earned tips."
good,"A typical day at chilli's was full of fun. I met a lot of people. My managers were nice, co-workers were fun to work with team players. The best part about this job is all the friends I made while there."
good,"Starts slow and get faster and faster as the day goes on. I learned how to take control of situation, as well as how to adapted to a personality filled work place."
good,Good place to work with opportunities to grow. Very flexible.
good,"In a typical day, I either host and greet/seat people who come in to sit down for a meal or I work the to go counter and take/prepare orders for people who want take out. In to go, I am also responsible for money handling on each order. In both positions, I also help servers bus tables and run food from time to time. I love the atmosphere and how fast paced everything is. Even when we are slow, there is always something to do and no two shifts are ever exactly the same. The people I work with are great. From the start, everyone was very welcoming and helpful to ""the new girl"" and it has been easy to develop friendships with my co-workers. The management is excellent; they all started where I did and worked their way up, so they really know how to manage. The hardest part of the job is standing/walking for hours on end and the unusual hours. For the most part, the job, though, is very enjoyable."
good,The job can get pretty hectic. I love working with my co-workers. the way our managers tend to manage is not very good.
good,"I had a great experience here. The managers were all always helpful specially with my school schedule. As long as I let them know in advance they didn't mind working with my schedule. I learned great customer service skills. The hardest part was sometimes keeping up when we were super busy. Or if you made ONE ilttle mistake, oh, a customer would let you have it! I really enjoyed my cowokers we all got along and even would hang out outside of work."
good,"The company is good about changing up the energy of the restaurant by having various competitions and charity promotions though out the year. The uniforms are decent and laid back, you don't have to rock a bunch of flare."
good,"Everyday was a new experience working with people that I enjoyed to be around and meeting new guests. Not only did I build relationships with my coworkers but I also built relationships with many of the guests who would come in on a regular basis. It was a fast paced environment which I liked because I work very well under pressure and I enjoy getting things done quickly and efficiently as well as multitasking. Management was always there to help whenever needed. I enjoyed this job very much because everyday there was always something new, trying to win contests in sales, I loved overseeing everyone when I did Quality Assurance and making sure things went out in a timely manner and correct. The best reward was being able to move up through the company it was a great feeling of accomplishment and gave me the opportunity to work in many different areas of the restaurant."
good,Great place for work in food service on shor term employement basis
good,"This company is a great place to learn and grow. It is a fun enviornment, inovative and always changing. If you like a fast pace, this is it."
good,This is a flexable job but I wouldn't recommend it for a career.
good,"A typical day at work is preparing drinks, distributing checks to co-workers, handling money, and making sure every guest has a great experience while in the restaurant. The hardest part of the job would be attempting to please people that are already unhappy, my most enjoyable part of the job is making money and seeing people leave happy."
good,Very busy place have to be a people person and willing to satisfy
good,"We are the busiest Chilis in northeast Florida. Iv'e learned that i am a great problem solver, in which makes me wanna get out the kitchen and into the business world."
good,i was able to learn the whole part of the back of house. The managers for the most part were straight forward told you what they expected out of you.
good,It seems like every position is very repetitive doing the exact same thing day after day. The pay is horrible.
good,Chilis has an excellent culture behind it. They really work hard to build strength as a team and do care about their employees just as much as the business.
good,"The management is fair and friendly, but also goal oriented. You work 90percent of holidays and weekends."
good,"I usually only worked lunch shift.During the lunch rush it was very upbeat.We all worked together during this time, teamwork is a big part of the cultural at this location.My experience is mostly all good.There was some bumps in the beginning with training and I had to get used to the ever changing roll over of managment.Which every person in managment does things differently."
good,Nice place to work has a few good perks and the try to accommodate there employees. Busy and willing to pay based on experience nd performance. Easy going work environment
good,It was hard work nonstop moving from clocking to clock out. Speed baby. Smart accurate thinking needed to handle the rush. Hard work dedication. Level headed.
good,Management needs to quit letting employee's do whatever they want. Employee's need to be held accountable. Management needs to schedule more people on certain days so we won't be short staffed.
good,"Server at fast-paced family-friendly restaurant."
good,Overall this was a great place to work would love to get another chance to work for this company the people there have good vibes and the management will work with you if you come to them with a problem
good,"I've learned quite a lot working at chili's. Teamwork and character building is key in the fast paced world of food service. Even more, you learn quite a bit about people in general."
good,"if you get stressed easily would not recommended it at all, it is really fast pace and most of the times you won't have time to take a break. very friendly and nice coworkers but a little messy and lazy. the managers often get really stressed and take it out on us but nothing too serious."
good,Good work environmentAnd you can get your food handling license and start prepping would you start learning while you’re cooking they will have other people training you it’s a fast pace go keep busy and move fast if you are good with your hands and reading and thinking fast. Manager have to have  people skills and when u take test it’s all about people skill and satisfy them
good,"Though stressful at times, it was a fun place to work. It was a struggle with constantly training in new staff, for them to leave for any given reason. Food quality is of utmost importance and I appreciated that aspect."
good,I learned a lot through y experience working at chili's. Nothing could replace that. Management worked with my schedule and I met a lot of many interesting people.
good,"Goof about working around your personal life schedule.  Friendly staff and good management. I think that Host's are not paid nearly enough they greet, seat and clean off tables but don't get tipped out by servers so they should make more."
good,Very laid back environment. Helpful workers. Management helps with any problems with scheduling or time off that is needed. Managers lend a listening ear and help where they can.
good,"Although it was fast paced, everyone worked as a team to get what was needed done. I enjoyed the atmosphere and people that I worked with; the only thing was the smoking in the bar, but they recently changed that."
good,Chili’s is a good first job or a way to get some quick cash. Management is good but no benefits other than 50% off food. You have to request off 2 weeks in advance if you don’t want to work a certain day.
good,"8-10 Hour work day"
good,I worked for this company for a very long time. The management team can make a great work environment. I’ve worked at three different locations and loved all of them. Great company to let for. Especially if you’re in school or have limited availability.
good,This is a great company to work for. Everyone is experienced and professional. Chilli's always tries to provide the best experience possible to every customer.
good,"It was just a restaurant job. sure the management was better than most places, but it was just a regular restaurant job.  and now I'm writing this last sentence to meet the minimum requirement."
good,"Easy job when everyone is working together. Otherwise, can easily turn terrible. Clientele is usually friendly and patient. Work pace must be fast in order to succeed."
good,"I worked as a hostess at Chili’s in Nacogdoches for about 4 months and this is the best management I ever had, they genuinely do care about their team and will help you advance in your life. The only things that were “cons” was the pay was $8.25/hr for hostess and  considering there was no busser position, it made it incredibly hard on really busy nights but the restaurant isn’t huge so it’s fine. Also, when you rarely ever hit even 30 hours a week, your paychecks are really low because they try to avoid over time  so you definitely have to ask for more hours so your paychecks aren’t really low. Great place to work especially for college students and people with part time availability. The management team has no problem working with you to advance to different positions, just stick to it & you’ll do great!"
good,Always very busy but always plenty of hands to help out. Excellent leadership for the top down. Definitely would take another position with them if the opportunity arises.
good,Working at Chili's I have been able to have the flexibility I desired to finish school and offered many opportunities to meet new people and make money.
good,"el staff gerencial puede llegar a ser algo tedioso, solicitan mucho de tu apoyo, pero cuando se trata de un apoyo para tu beneficio suelen ser algo cerrados, pero en general hay buen ambiente con tus compañeros, hay cierta facilidad en el desarrollo y hay mucho aprendizaje."
good,"Fun, you get to interact with customers and co workers the whole time, easy and flexible scheldule, good when you need cash in hand immediately. overall an enjoyable place to work"
good,"Hosting at Chili's is a very simple jobs, you only need to learn about very basic terms such as rotation, open menus and know how to manage well how you seat costumers. It's fun to engage with costumers that are willing to do so but you might encounter one or other costumer that are less polite."
good,"This is a very team effort restaurant, with many friendly co workers who will help whenever it is needed. Management treats the employees as friends for the most part. It is quick paced but with a simple menu and simple ingredients."
good,"Hard work, fun environment. Management in Baton Rouge, LA was lacking. They were all so new to Chili’s. Passion for the brand was there via Summer at least."
good,"Although Chili's could be crowded and stressful at times, it was enjoyable overall. I became friends with my coworkers and I still communicate with some of the staff."
good,"Being a chili’s hostess is a good first time job. It gives you experience with people and co-workers. Weekends are the busiest and it does get very hectic. During the week, business is more chill."
good,I make good money. i just wish people had more teamwork. I work mostly lunch during the weeks and weekends I work nights and those are usually crazy fun.
good,"Its a great job for anyone starting out. We hire alot of teens that work with their schedules for school, sports etc. Management tends to play favorites. Theres alot of drama though so dont get sucked in. Money is cool but in our area we dont get tipped enough to deal with the abuse from certain guests. We are always short staffed so when someone needs the day off or call out there isnt anyone to take their shifts and it's considered a no call no show. There is room for improvement and advancement but you got to want it. Theres been a few servers who've turned to managment . I feel like if chilis didnt hire such young kids and hired enough people to be able to cover shifts it would be a great place to work. Literally all teenagers run the QA line ."
good,"Good benefits, decent pay.  More tools than any company I've worked for.  Sometimes too many tools and not enough trust in skills. High stress environment."
good,"Como mesera, es tu responsabilidad el manejo de terminales y efectivo, se utiliza un sistema avanzado para el ingreso de ordenes, tienes capacitacion constante, ademas de percibir el 6% de las propinas, el otro 4% se saca segun la cantidad de dinero vendida y se reparte entre el resto del personal, turnos rolados, un cierre va de las 4 pm hasta las 2-3 am. Cuentas con descuentos en las marcas de alsea, un dia de descanso pagado por tu cumpleaños, seguro medico, comida de emppleado de lunes a viernes. Oportunidades de crecimiento constantesy buen ambiente de trabajo."
good,It’s a fun job to have. There is a lot of people there for you. It can be a great work environment where everyone helps everyone. It’s also very easy to get along with people there
good,Chili's has a good company culture and flexible work hours. They do guest surveys and give you hours based on the results of the surveys. Management is very understanding and genuinely wants to retain their staff.
good,This company lacks structure and passion. Unlike other food establishments this one in particular could care less about their staff and has a high turnover rate because of it.
good,"aprendí muchas cosas preparación de platos fríos a la carta , preparación de salsas , atención al publico etc."
good,Working at Chili's means working together as a team and as a family. everyone works together to make sure that our guests have a great experience at our restaurant.
good,"Chilis was an overall great place for work. Always busy, never a dull moment, managers all were mainly helpful in most situations, teamwork was always performed there  as well."
good,"The employees offered a fun working environment. The feeling when you go to work is wonderful. However, it is very easy to get stressed at such a cut throat work place, and the managers did not know how to deal with this."
good,Good place to work at   Great kitchen with good co workers that work face paced and make sure the job gets done and correct the first time. Pay isn’t too bad
good,"Working for Chili's have its pro and cons. I really enjoy working there its just when it comes to personal things they don't care. As of right, now I am going through a rough time at where my living situation is very messed up right now to the point I might have to go to a hotel. I also have a son who I have to provide a roof over his head. I have no time off to do that. At the end of the day its a great company with SOME great managers!"
good,"Good place to work in the past..  Things may have change, but when  I was with bonus was made every month, had the opportunity to do many off site meetings always followed by some enjoyment event, like a GM conference in Vegas ever other year.  Not sure if it is still like that, but nice at that time."
good,"* Typical day is busy"
good,"I bartended at chili’s for the last year and it has been a great experience for me. Very straightforward and easy hospitality type of work. Great for someone who needs consistent work, but you won’t get rich working there."
good,"Chili's was ok to work at, but I struggled with the hours and environment.  It was a great place, but just not a good fit for me.  I enjoyed the cash tips.  This is more for young, single people though."
good,Chilies was honestly one of the best places I have ever worked the culture there is great you feel excepted the first do you start working in the managers will work around your schedule
good,Good place to work. But there is no benefits. Good money. Everyone is nice. No paid time off. Half off when your working. 10% when your not. Good environment.
good,"A typical day at work includes managing multiple tasks simultaneously while balancing a fast-paced work environment. As the training captain, I have learned how to coach and direct fellow coworkers on how to better grasp the fundamental skills required for a successful work place. The best part of the job is to see all team members working efficiently together in order to produce a successful shift and work day. The most challenging yet rewarding aspect of this job is having to troubleshoot a problem and quickly think on your feet in order to resolve it. Overall, this company allows for the development of vital skills that can help lead to success at any company."
good,"It’s a good part-time job. You have to like working around people because you’ll be doing it all day, at a fast pace. It’s a great experience. You learn new things daily, customer service is tough but worth it."
good,Great place to work. Flexible scheduling. professional yet comfortable work setting. Most enjoyable part of job was the people I worked with. The hardest part of the job was it can get to be a fast paced setting.
good,"A typical day included getting the store ready for guests to arrive and be seated, then taking care of them from their drink order all the way threw to when they are done with their dish. Cleaning all the tables and making sure all the food orders are prepared the way the guest requested and making sure everything is perfect so they leave with a excellent and happy experience and wanting to come back."
good,Fast paced and hard working.  Long hours during week and weekends including holidays.  Strong culture and great people.  Still friends with many of these individuals today.
good,"Recommends"
good,"I liked that I learned how to work with teammates, be fast and truly work hard for my money. I also value work a lot more since Chili’s is a hard but likeable job and I learned how to work under pressure."
good,"atención a cliente, manejo de efectivo, activo, manejo de terminales, gerencia regular, divertido ambiente, porras para aliviar el estrés, dificil de atender mas de 30 invitados repartidos, dinámicas, buen ambiente."
good,Depending on how hard you work the more money you get. Its all based off tips. They are flexible with days off and if you find someone to cover your shift. It was a fun place to work for.
good,"Es un buen lugar para trabajar, te apoyan con los horarios, aprendes mucho con respecto a la atención de los clientes, control de inventarios, food cost y generar un margen de ganancias."
good,"Chili’s is a great place to work, but lack of management experience or an urge to be there hurts the staff morale. I would recommend working for chili’s."
good,The job was rather easy. It was fun and laid back when it came to the people that I worked with. The customers 90% of the time were very understanding.
good,"chilis was a good experience for me , it taught me alot of self control and patience along with just being able to enjoy my job and the people i worked with"
good,"I really enjoy the people I work with and the managers are also very fun. Most of the servers are college students also and are considerate of your needs, so they will take one of your shifts if you need to. The managers are also fairly young in age and also understand what college life is like so they're upbeat and considerate about your needs. It's just fun to interact with the customers that come in too because you get a lot of people who understand the fast-paced environment and understand that you might not be able to tend to them a lot every time."
good,While working for this company I learned the value of prioritizing my duties as well as multitasking. The management was cooperative when asking question about unfamiliar obstacles.
good,"I only worked there for a short amount of time. From a small town, I made decent money. Managers are totally different, so going from one persons way of managing to another was annoying, but you have to do that everywhere. I liked it when I was here."
good,The money is great as long as you're good at what you do. If you want to move up to manager the opportunity is there. Coworkers are pretty great and understanding and helpful when training.
good,同事主管好相處，工作環境尚可，就是上班時間太長人手不足，一人要當1.5~2人使用，整天幾乎時間都很趕，做完一件馬上要做下一件，甚至要兩件同時進行才不會拖到自己的時間
good,There was always something for me to do when I was hosting. I would either clean tables off for servers or manage the Front of House. Hosting is one of the most important roles in the restaurant business so I encourage to be well prepared for high stress situations.
good,"I developed great relationships with the guests to better their experience and ensure their return, I made great tips and my job was fun. Management is poor."
good,"Chili's, although easy-going and fun, has a high turn-around rate due to over staffing and loss of hours. The job itself isn't stressful, and most days is actually very fun, I enjoy going to work each day, I love the interaction with my coworkers and managers, but the hours are too few in number to pay my bills."
good,"A typical day would be 2 people to a section, usually by the end of the night you had your exercise done for the day. "
good,A typical day at work started at 10:00 a.m. I would start by helping the cooks prep some food then took out boxes and stocked the dry storage. After that I would set up all the wash bottles and wrags for the servers.  Once business opened for the day I would clean tables and let them know when they were ready.
good,"Chili’s has been a fun work environment. Managers are easy going and help with anything to accommodate your needs. Work is relatively easy, but management expects more than what they pay for. Advancement in the company is possible, pay raise as a hourly employee isn’t easy and sometimes you have to almost beg."
good,come in and get straight to work.  there was always something to do.  very fast pace and fun to work for. make sure to know your meal and be polite to customers.
good,The workplace was good just the hours wasnt always available because of cut back. If it offered more than I would have possibly stayed a bit longer. Striving for some great things
good,it was a nice place to work enjoyed everyone I worked with and meeting people. I would still be there probably if I hadn't found another full time job.
good,Overall it’s a 3 out of 5 stars place to work. I’m not very happy with the communication of the management about performance of employees. I also do not like the unsteady hours and pay based on tips.
good,Company goals are guest driven and the corporation should include more of an operations outlook to be additionally beneficial to retain their employees.
good,"Fine place for a summer job, friendly coworkers, good management. Would recommend to others seeking part-time employment. Typical Customer service/food service job."
good,"Chili's is a decent place to work. They're biggest issue is that they are a small fish in a huge ocean of restaurants. Your time at Chili's will be fun but money wise it's 50/50. You may make some money, you may not. They are constantly understaffed in all positions, even management. While they aren't a terrible company to work for, they could be a lot better."
good,This was a busy and fast paced place to work. Overall I enjoyed it though. I wish they would have offered more consistent hours. The pay was decent but the hours were not enough.
good,I learned to communicate effectively and work in a fast-paced environment. The hardest part of the job would be working in a high-intensity fast paced environment.
good,My work days were actually not that bad! I've learned to deal with people more better than ever here. management was pretty cool! Hard days only really existed when it's busy season.
good,"I liked working there, it was an ubeat environment with pleasurable people. It was always busy there but money was always earned. The fast paced environment made it feel like a game, so it made work fun for me."
good,"I have honestly enjoyed working at chili's. Other than a few rough managers and co workers passing through, it's a great team with good management and awesome team spirit."
good,I enjoyed my time working for Chilli's. The fast pace & competitiveness is what drives you to be & do your best there. This place also helps you improve your social skill's.
good,"Management and co-workers were always a joy to work with. Unfortunately it was my time to move on to bigger things. Enjoyed my time there, and would recommend any young person in high school or college to start here to earn some extra dough."
good,"People like to complain on the ziosks and lie.  No one was yelling at anyone, I was delegating authority loud enough so she could hear me and someone complained about me. And then no one investigated."
good,"This job was a good place to work but I felt like I needed more, especially because I didn’t get paid vacation no benefits. I only got discounts and I felt like that wasn’t enough for me."
good,This wasn't a bad job. I worked with good people. I made some pretty good money on busy nights. Sometimes it could get super crazy though. The best part about the job was definitely the friends I made.
good,I worked as a server at chili's. Working my tables and delivering beverages and food! It was great! the tips you make you keep no pooled tipping. The people became my family and a few of my closest friends to this day. It was a fun fast paces environment. Your in control the harder you work the more money you make.
good,"I love working for Chili's however in the recent years there have been frequent changes in management which is hard to keep up with standards. when its good its really good, overall it is a great environment and my coworkers are great people. Company is all about how they can make the most with fewest people on per shift."
good,"Greeting guest, seating guests with menus, serving and delivery drinks and food to the tables, making guest comfortable and giving the best service. The most enjoyable part of the job is when guests are satisfied with the service provided."
good,One of the first companies and one of the longest durations that I have worked for a company.  I was very lucky to have a good management staff over the years.
good,"easy place to work and learn the basic skills of serving. staff is friendly and welcoming, along with the managers. pay can be good or bad depending on the season."
good,"Chili's was one of the best jobs I've ever had. Chili's is fare about almost everything they pay very good, they also allow you to work as many hours as possible. The only problem I've ever had with Chili's was a new manager that doesn't respect his employees"
good,I loved working for chilis because it was fast paced and my coworkers were amazing! management could use some help though. My manager made an accusation towards me that wasnt true and ran with it causing me to leave chilis.
good,I learned a lot about what this company has to offer and the scheduling is always good and they will always work around what you need. Management was always happy to have me come in and take care of whatever had to be done.
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job was the crew. Regardless what we had going on outside of work, when we got to Chili's we were family. We enjoyed helping one another make money and have a great time while doing it. We uplifted each other!"
good,"The only problems I have working here are coworkers, not the managers nor the company. However, since the front-of-house staff keep their jobs through customer surveys and the scores they get, it is difficult for managers to help decent workers who get one bad score on a slow day. Other than that, I would recommend working here"
good,"I was very fortunate to work with a great GM who valued his employees and made them feel appreciated. I started as a server but filled in for many job positions when needed and was given one on one guidance for office management and team leadership. I quickly established myself as efficient and reliable and soon had the more desirable work shifts. I was promoted up to the Front of House Trainer by the corporate manager, Key/Assistant Manager by the GM,  and was asked several times to accompany the District Manager when he was in town for various events."
good,"Chili's as a corporation and as a brand is one of, or maybe even the best place I have ever worked at/for. There's just been something about it.. I feel like it may have been the great staff at my location and the great management - all positive, happy, caring people to be around. I would look forward to going to work. Teamwork and positive reinforcement filled our shifts. "
good,"I enjoyed my job at Chili's. It was quick paced and I was always moving which is what I enjoy. It was a good work environment with good people, everybody pitched in equally. Management was sometimes shaky as far as them all agreeing but overall good."
good,"A typical day of work at Chili's was preparing for the shift overall - whether it would be reservations or to mentally prepare for the possibility of it being busy, being in the unpredictable industry. I've acquired social skills, dealing with customer concern and in an appropriate and timely manner. The hardest part of the job was applying your knowledge to situations under pressure, and the most enjoyable part of the job was being able to have the support of my coworkers and others in the overall friendly environment."
good,I think with waitressing its self explanatory. some good days some bad. Tips come and go. Hard hustle for an stable income. Other than that it was a blast.
good,"The management was okay. The work environment and the people were great and professional.   The restaurant was on florida state university's campus, and it was ruined by Aramark."
good,"Great part time job. flexible schedules, and easy to change and pick up shifts. Corporate standards are easy to follow and abide. Most managers are good, let you do you."
good,"Good place to build strong work partnerships. Great team building culture, desirable benefits, and fun atmosphere. Plenty of opportunity to build your skill set."
good,Fast paced environment and always changing. Good verbal communication is extremely important throughout all positions. Attention to detail is a necessary skill.
good,"In the back, there aren't a lot of places for you to move up, few raises, and you cover multiple positions a shift. The management is very hands on and will help when necessary, but they kind of give you the run-around."
good,"the company measured all management on financials, people and sales. Our store did fairly well with people and sales and reviews looked good. Our general manager was trying to do his own bar promos locally."
good,"Fast paced environment and Customer Service skills. A typical day at work would be seating customers, cleaning tables and floors. The hardest part of my job would be managing to clean many tables at once knowing no one is there to help. Also, not knowing when i get off."
good,Had a good time enjoyed the people I worked with and would go back if they were closer I started as a fry cook and within a few months had earned 3 raises and  would be lead cook on some shifts learned a lot about myself and grew confidence in myself over all just had a great time working there and the people were great
good,"I looked forward to work at Chili's. I got along well with everyone from my managers and fellow servers to the customers. Every week there were contests for various things, such as the server who sold the most daily specials would recieve a free meal or appetizer. Some days would be slow some busy but it was always a pleasant place to be. Great atmosphere and food."
good,"I worked here 2 weeks short of a year, until I had a server run into me with a serving tray and refused to apologize, this changed my demeanor, and the mgr at the time, waited till the lunch rush was over about 2 hr's later, to see if I was ok and give me any info I needed,  it went downhill from there with constant harassment from the servers family that all worked there, I was eventually let go, but i filed wrongful termination, and eventually the whole mgmt team was replaced, but one of the servers is still there today."
good,Working at chili's has been quite an experience. It is a fast paced environment that continues to challenge me each shift. Working in customer service is unlike any other job.
good,"It was a fun, exciting place to work and the customers were generally really happy when they would come in. I didn't mind my coworkers, although serving is a pretty competitive workplace."
good,Everyday I had to make sure orders went out right. Also make sure if the servers need anything from the cooks to get it. Almost everyday was stressful and busy.
good,"I enjoyed working here, however i was only a hostess if i was a server im sure i would have enjoyed it more. The people i worked with we awesome, i got a long with everyone."
good,Management is decent and coworkers are cool. You get big sections and can make pretty good money depending on the shift. The work culture is really upbeat and managers do a lot to keep server morale up by playing games and having sales competitions.
good,"Enjoyed working here, but felt it was time to move up in the world. Management was always on top of their game. Staff always had fun, made it a great work environment."
good,Chili's is a good employer with strong organization and encouraging prospects. Working for Chili's has improved my appreciation for work and what it means to be a contributing employer.
good,"fun place to work if you have positive customer service"
good,I go to work. All of my managers and coworkers are nice. They treat everyone with respect and they do not stereo-type anyone nor do they discriminate. I love my job and the people that are there.
good,its been so long since I worked with this company that I can barely remember policies and procedures and besides...they have probably changed to the extremes by now
good,"Chilli's was a good establishment to work for, although the food times were a little long. Management really started to go down hill, didn't feel like things were being taken care of like they should have been."
good,"This was a fun place to be a manager,  Many daily interactions with employees and customers.  Chilis has a great culture for employees and management alike."
good,GLORIFIED FAST FOOD!! High pressure and very fast paced. No real cooking! Average cook times are about 3 to 4 minutes.. Just slapping precooked food on plates.
good,"Primary trainer for about 15 servers and incoming managers."
good,Very busy everyday with very little product to serve the guests with. GM very confrontational and will fire people on the spot for arguing with him. All cook and wait staff very friendly.
good,"I have good hours at my location, I get along with most everyone on staff, but I don't ever get breaks. The shifts aren't long so that's okay, but my feet get tired."
good,"Overall, Chili's has been very good to me over the past 3 years i have worked there. They always take me back after extended absences at school, and work really well with my schedule. The co-workers i have are also some of my best friends. This job has taught me a lot about costumer service and the hospitality industry. "
good,Working at Chili's was a huge boost in my confidence. My co-workers were like a family and everyone looked out for each other to make sure we all succeed. The job was very fast paced and always busy. There was always something to do.
good,"Solid company, very structured, good systems.  Expectations are well set out.  The company has a clear vision of where it is going and is laser focused on that."
good,I really enjoyed working in a fast paced environment. I would continue to work with this company but I am in the process of switching career paths. Great Company.
good,"Chilis customer base is substantial in most towns and therefore, the servers can make good money. The management at this chilis are highly knowledgeable. The opportunities to move up are minimal, but possible if you out in your time."
good,"Working at Chili's was a great way to make money during school and learn about a progressive company in the hospitality industry. I gained supervisory experience with the Key Team Member position however, without a degree there was not much more room for growth."
good,"Hardworking staff, friendly environment, face working pace, love meeting new people and making new friends, hardest part would be customer complaints."
good,"A typical day at work depended on whether I was serving the floor, behind the bar, or working the cocktail area.  I learned a lot about consolidation of duties & up-selling.  Management was very supportive.  Co-workers were fairly dependable for teamwork.  The hardest part of the job was the wide variety of customers, many of whom seemed to be cranky.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the relationships I formed with my co-workers."
good,It was a fun place to work. The team was amazing. It's hard to balance work and life because of all the hours we work there. The managers aren't really great but they are helpful.
good,"If you are looking for a company that has a great, family like environment, this is the place to work. The people here are exceptional and really make going to work a pleasure."
good,I just enjoy working at this company cause the co workers are polite everybody helps out in  every way. The general manger/ supervisor assist their employers
good,"This restaurant was by far my favorite to work in. The staff was excellent and the management was even better. Really hands on managers, there everyday with rolled sleeves getting the work to flow for the staff in the front of house and in the back of house. Excellent job."
good,Fue un buen ambiente de trabajo compañeros y jefes de mi agrado.
good,"It was fun working at Chili's. I met many new people and became friends with many of the regulars. A typical day at work was cleaning, communicating and seating parties. The hardest part of this job was standing all day. The most enjoyable part of this job was interacting with the many people who came each night."
good,"A typical day serving at Chili's requires you to constantly be alert for anything the customer needs. You will work with team members on ensuring a positive experience for the guest. The hardest part about the job is dealing with our kitchen, sometimes they are slow so that affects my tip rate."
good,Overall it was a great experience working at Chili's bar and grill I love the atmosphere I love helping customer. My reason of leaving Chili's was due to the company going out of business and the lack of customers paying.
good,"If you are employed at Chili's, you have to be prepared to give 100% ever day. You are often expected to 10-15 hours shifts with little rest, this is also a very high volume store on weekends. However, management is always willing to work with you and train you in areas that you may struggle with. The workload is always very heavy, so there is never a dull moment. The work day definitely flies by because of this."
good,Every one I worked with was nice and the job task was never difficult. I was in charge of greeting guests and taking them to their seats. Since I was only in high school at the time it was easy to have a social life as well.
good,Great company that offers a fun culture and work environment.  Brinker International is also very connected with amazing organizations such as St.Jude and make a wish foundation.  Brinker cares about their employees and offers a great quality of life.
good,"It was a fun place to work. Very fast paced. Very friendly. If you're a ""people person"", it's for you. I enjoyed my time with Chili's."
good,"A typical day is opening and setting up the bar, prepping drinks and getting ready for the day shift. I always have something to do to keep me busy even during the down times. Good money, and lots of regulars who come back. Fun environment."
good,"At rimes it can be very hectic, but i like fast paced work places."
good,"Restaurant work is great for a first job, and Chili's bar & grill in Jacksonville, FL on Atlantic blvd is no exception. A friendly staff with cooperative assistant managers, the establishment never knew any sort of disaster or even slight drama in my several month stay as the dishwasher. Only complaint would be the lack of sick leave, or at least the willingness on behalf of management for employees to take the time off. Although repeatedly informed weeks in advance, my dentist appointment to extract wisdom teeth was received as surprise by our regional manager. Despite having a note from my docter, I was let go over the phone after my recovery period of twelve days. Regardless, my time and expierence at Chili's left me with newfound appreciation of restaurant work, a deeper understanding of sanitation and fire safety, as well as respect for the teamwork I had witnessed and able to be a part of."
good,The general manager at chilis manhatten beach was terrible at taking care of his employees. Tried to transfer due to me moving 200 miles away and busted out with some lame excuse for me not being able to transfer. Had to work for 3 months traveling 400 miles coming and going.I called off once for having car problems and he fired me.
good,Very good with people and with a wide group of diverse individuals i loved it there very understanding and amazing food I highly recommend going or working there
good,"A typical day at work consisted of seating customers, putting them on a wait list, helping them feel comfortable and welcome, cleaning the restaurant. I learned how to make customers my first priority in the work place and how to make them feel comfortable and welcome. My coworkers were good people who respected me. The hardest part of my job was the fast paced work environment with a short staff. I loved the help customers feel welcome and comfortable."
good,"Take people to their tables and fold kids menus."
good,I am the Marketing/Outreach Manager and help with our fundraising events. I really enjoy what I do but the hours have been cut. I have a great relationship with the management and  get along with everyone. I really enjoy the flexibility. I am just looking for more hours as they have had reduce the labor.
good,"being a sales associate and being into physical work gives me a sales approach that is unique to some customers, my up bringing has instilled a manner that is quite attentive and some what relaxed. Perfect for a service associate of many types. sales is what I do and providing the avenue for the customers is my main goal"
good,"Fun work place Great team, Management was disorganized especially with scheduling but luckily had a great team and the ability to switch shift very easily when management didn't listen or care about your school scheduled."
good,"Working with Chilis made me fall in love with the restaurant business ."
good,"I loved working here because I was always busy and it was so productive. My typical day at work was standing at the host stand greeting guests as they came in and taking them to their tables. Also keeping the dining area swept and clean as well as the restrooms. Management was ok could've been better but I liked the managers. Overall this was the perfect job for me, if I got the opportunity to go back I would."
good,"Everyone is like family, can be fun to work. Hardest part of the job were the customers who got mad over trivial things. The management was good and looked out for their employees."
good,"Definitely the fastest restaurant that I've worked for."
good,I started out as a server and quickly became apart of the management team. Here is where i got my feet wet as a floor manager of a restaurant. The management team was always willing to show and help the team members. The coworkers always had a positive attitude. The hardest part was just getting into the groove of a management position. The most enjoyable would always be the guest and the people you get the opportunity to meet.
good,"A day at Chili's entails great costumer service, multitasking, team work, and the ability to be willing.  I enjoyed working at Chili's as it gave me a chance to work with the public and also be taught how to handle money."
good,It was a fun environment and upbeat. I believe everyone should work in the restaurant business at least one time in their life to get the experience.
good,"I enjoyed my job at chili's very much other than the low amount of hours and low pay grade."
good,A typical day was to keep the guests happy at all time by taking there order with a smile and serving them as fast as possible. The most enjoyable part of the job was the coworkers and managers who were always there to help you when it was busy or you needed a good laugh at the end of the work day.
good,"Carbondale Chili's is an amazing place to you. You receive many hours and have great staff, managers and GM. Fun, fast pace work place where you are able to make good money."
good,"•	Prepare food items in a hygienic and timely mannerSet up "
good,"Chili's/Brinker International is a great company to work for. New school methods are taking over. They are trying to change the industry. Health insurance, benefits and faction - not the greatest at these things."
good,"Love dealing with the customers as they come in."
good,"Working at Chilis I met a lot of people. The management team is just that, part of the team. We made our jobs fun and understood communication is key. The hardest part of the job was the customers; those that came in just to complain or don't quite understand that servers are living off of the tip they leave on the table. the most enjoyable part of the job was also the customers; getting to build relationships with regulars, hearing and telling stories, comparing lives and knowing that when they come back, they are asking for you,"
good,Very few complaints about this location. too many in company up -sell contests that determine your schedule. Average tip from excellent service in this place is 13%
good,I got to learn how to communicate with tourist who speak different languages and learned how to work with different diversity it was a big group of people working all in one small place.
good,Each day consisted of cleaning tables while seating guests. My co workers and management were good for a college job. The most enjoyable part of the job was having a close relationship to my co workers.
good,"A typical day at work would involve doing all the prep for the day as well as cooking for customers. I learned how to cook more efficiently and better.  Management was a little disorganized but due to my previous manager experience I was able to make sure the prep list was right so there wouldn't be over prepped food making it to where the food costs wouldn't be significantly affected. I worked with great co-workers with good attitudes making the workplace fun even when super busy.  The hardest part of the job was making sure the kitchen had enough food for the day, because if you didn't do enough prep then we would fall behind, but if I did too much prep then our food costs would increase.  The most enjoyable part of the job for me was cooking and making customers happy."
good,"I love the managers and the GM at this restaurant. All of them are friendly and do their best to make their employees happy. It's easy to make money quick here most of the year. There are some slow periods, but it's still enough money to live off of. The hardest part of the job is the customers - most of them are pleasant, but there are a few that are just terrible and very disrespectful. The restaurant is also too small for the demand. It's the busiest restaurant in town, so it becomes packed very quickly. That makes the workplace very cramped, but everyone makes money that way. The coworkers are decent. Everyone does their job - no slackers. There are some great personalities here."
good,There is a lot of great co-worker and manger. It is a hard job you have to be fast and able to act quickly. A typical work day is very busy.
good,"Lunch and dinner server, expeditor, assisted management.  Learned how to manage, schedule, train and maintain quality of product."
good,"We had about 6 of us that would not work in a section with any one but 1 of us 6. We had a very young and weak staff, as well as managers. It could had been ran better by management instead of us 6."
good,"Generally worked from 4 to 1130"
good,"Here I learned more how to run a business Learning how to control a"
good,"Overall a good place to work, benefits aren't as good as I'd like but they offer part-time benefits which is really nice."
good,This is a good company to work for. They believe in promoting from within. Like all restaurant jobs there is no room for a life outside of this job. Any time away from the building is spent on reports or reviews. Very little time for family. I have PTO days to use but impossible to actually use.
good,A typical day was exciting in the fact that each day you never knew what to expect for customer volume. We had to be prepared for zero to sixty all the time. My experience here taught me a lot about who I am and what type of person I wanted to be. Because I had been accustomed to meeting new coworkers on a consistent basis I learned about the many work ethics of different people. For me the hardest part of my job was watching other coworkers not give as much effort as I did in our work. My favorite part of this job was meeting all the people that I did. I feel that I had learned from the many customers and colleagues I had and hopefully helped them in one way or another.
good,Great family culture.  Growth was stunted but the diversity of the menu changing and growing kept things interesting for guests and staff.
good,I am very loyal to any job that is put before me. I have worked at this particular chili's since the doors opened on day one. I enjoy working with all the employees and getting to know the customers. Making customers happy is definitely my favorite part of the day. I also enjoy getting to work closely with my GM on the parts of his job that hold the restaurant together. The hardest part of this job is knowing that this can not be a career for me and eventually I will have to move on.
good,Good place to work and advance in the company.  The managers are friendly and willing to work your schedule around your other responsibilities in life.
good,"Very demanding, hours not very conducive to a family lifestyle."
good,I love this job because of the many different people I have meet along the way.This job has allowed me to encounter pepople form many different nationalities. My co-workers are amazing they help keep the flow of things and we treat each other like family. The management is pretty good as well. We have only had a few issues with the leaving and replacing and the constant change of the management. It is never consistant and that makes it the hardest part of the job.
good,"I loved working at Chili's it was the longest I have ever had a job for, I consider it to be my first real job being that it was over six months of employment. It was always an upbeat environment with loud music and lots of laughs. We worked quickly but diligently and always took pride in the presentation of our food. I learned team service and always remaining professional regardless of the situation at hand. A typical day at work was running food, communicating with people, answering the phone, taking orders, helping others, and helping in the kitchen. The management was really strict and didn't allow ""no-shows"" although they were understanding if you had a good reason no to come in. Management always stepped in when things started to get overwhelming. My coworkers kept me going, we were like a family at Chili's; of course there were some people I preferred not to work with, but you learn to work with all types of people regardless of preference. The hardest part of the job is when people were unsatisfied with their food, or the kitchen getting so bogged down that it took forever to send the food out. The most enjoyable part of my job was the people I worked with, they were a great support system and I still remain close friends with them today."
good,Under several new management. Looking for a new career due to the direction the company is going. Not enough support with current job.
good,"A typical day at work consists of making customers happy from start to finish. I have learned to work well under pressure. Management for the most part is supportive of their staff. We, as employees work well with each other for the most part. The hardest part is expecting the unexpected, but that is where I learned how to manage myself well. We, as a staff, treated each other as family."
good,"es un trabajo donde te puedes desarrollar profecional y personalmente, te dan la oprtunidad de ir hacendiendo, mucha precion, la gerencia es muy buena, te apoyan mucho, es un trabajo muy divertido, donde aprendes a trabajar en equipo, lo mas dificil es el trato con el cliente, ya que hay mucha variedad de caracter y de frma de los clientes, hay muy buenos y hay muy malos y groseros, pero enm general es un buen trabajo, tambien lo dificil son los horarios, ya que no son fijos y el cierre los fines de semana es hasta las 3 o 4 de la mañana."
good,"it was okay, but the pay was very low. it wouldnt go back to fast food restaurants."
good,"I would have the responsibilities to open or close the restaurant, hiring and training employees, Roll-outs, and daily deposits. I was in charge of inventory, AVT,  the P&L responsibilities, and Ecosure/Health Department. "
good,"Chilis is a busy, hardworking resturant to work in. The management is okay but I feel it can be much better. It's a buddy thing with some of the managers and some of them don't seem easy to approach if you have a problem. As a far as work some of the managers don't care about your well being just themselves."
good,A typical day included about a 6 hour shift. I learned how to be able to multitask and complete different jobs. Co-workers we very nice. It was very enjoyable to get to meet different people whether it was guests or the different people that worked there.
good,"worked as a server, very fast paced enjoyed it. Hardest part was to close, run some trays as heavey as yourself."
good,"Typical workday would have been to meet and greet the guests as they walked in the door and seat them in an appropriate amount of time. Ensure quality of food on the line was of standard or better quality. Stocking area, maintaining clean bathroom and work area. Preparing orders for to-go guests. Suggesting menu items as well as drink specials. Refilling beverages. Expediting food to guests in timely fashion. "
good,"But my forte of cooking, I like to make sure each dish I enjoyable not fast."
good,"Good hours, supportive management (for the most part), decent money."
good,"Fast paced work environment, team-service, cleaning, and serving the guest's needs ( to make sure they return). For the most part, management is very helpful to making sure everything runs smoothly.The hardest part of the job would have to be when your section partner doesn't do their half of the work. I love working with people, so meeting new guests is the most enjoyable part!"
good,"A typical day at work is not always so typical. Every shift is a new challenge. Whether there is a contest going on, or  an event happening. Every year for a couple months we host a fundraiser to help support the children with cancer from St. Jude Research Hospital. We always have up-selling contest to see who can sell the most of an menu item, and there are always prizes given to the winner. Your co-workers are considered your team. We all have to work together to provide the best service to our guests. The hardest part of the job is knowing your information. If a guests has a question, you need to know the answer and answer it to the best of your knowledge which is sometimes challenging. You have to know your menu! The most enjoyable part of the job would be knowing you succeeded in making someone happy."
good,busy restaurant which made working not feel as if I was working. Just one big group of friends.
good,days get busier around lunch time. i learned how to become more responsible. the management was not very easy to get along with. job wasn't hard at all. most enjoyable part was being around fun co-workers.
good,The environment at chili's was great and I loved the people I worked with but in all management wasn't the best at what they were supposed to do.
good,Brinker International is a great company to work for. The atmosphere and the work environment is welcoming and enjoyable.
good,"Serving food and drinks to customers."
good,"Working for chilli's was very enjoyable and a fun job to do, where you get to meet new people every day, and I am personally a ""people-person"". I learned how to work in the hospitality field and how important it is to treat costumers in a friendly and accurate manner. I had a good relationship with my managers and co-workers that in fact I'm still friends with most of them."
good,"Hard work, great sense of urgency, and great communication skills are a necessity to succeed at Chili's Grill & Bar."
good,"*  Food prep"
good,great money and flexible hours. I liked it but needed more of a chanllenge
good,"Pros: 'Flexible work schedule, Fun employees, and Great food."
good,"Finishing my senior year of high school, I worked at the local Chili's as my first job. I learned the concept of a restaurant and how everything worked from being a server to what the cooks had to do to prepare the food. I still have a friendship with the managers, and work staff that I still know from working at Chili's. "
good,"friendly people to work with, good on-the-job training, great corrective procedures, overall fun job experience"
good,Management believes in its employees doing the best job possible.
good,everything there was good no complaints. i learned how the kitchen runs and what it takes to make each dish to the best it can b
good,"A typical day at work would be go in and see if my station is stocked or if its busy help catch the person up who's at my station. Í've basically learned everything that would go on in a kitchen. I have also learned a lot from my co-workers. The hardest part of the job would have to be when its really busy and you run out of stuff you have to run and get it really fast, while people are asking to get stuff and you also having to make food as well. The most enjoyable part of the day honestly when its over and closing time because if it was a hard day you feel accomplished you got through it and are done with it."
good,They worked with your life to give you a schedule that worked. It is great for making money while you are in school. When looking for a career it is not for eveyone and growth within the company is limited. Does not always help when looking to start another career either.
good,bar all work
good,I worked for Chilis for 6 years and can honestly say I stayed that long for a reason! The restaurant environment is a very fun and active one and can bring out the best in anyone!
good,"fun, energetic setting... not much room for advancement... good job while in school or great second job ! not reliable for only, permanent income."
good,Chilis was a great company to work for. Tghe only reason I left was to go in business for myself.
good,Serving customers to their satisfaction. A very relaxed work place.
good,"Bartending at a chain restaurant is what it is. It's nothing sensational, but it pays the bills and it's a fun work environment. You make margaritas and pour beers and talk to people and go home with half decent money. The hours can be crazy, as are all restaurant jobs. Management was suspect and there was a ton of turnover. But overall, good experience."
good,"I usually work in the kitchen as a QA, I make sure all food goes out to the table in a timely matter and up to expectations. The cooks are almost like a family to me, they have taught me how to stand my ground and how to properly communicate with my co-workers. My managers played a large role in molding me by giving me constructive criticism and taught me everything I know today. Although the hardest part is that it is very fast paced therefore sometimes communication is lost but in my position I try to get to the bottom of all problems for the customers. The most enjoyable part is that I am a major a part of the success of our team and that I can make other people enjoy working for this company."
good,Chili's Bar and Grill has provided me an opportunity to establish myself financially while I seek a job in my career field.
good,you get what you put into. great job for students. very flexible schedules. will work with you
good,"loved the job, loved my co-workers the management was great and orginized, Great communicatin between everybody"
good,good co workers and great gm it was a great experiences to work for this company had a blast with the managers also the trips the company sent us on they were great
good,"Aprendi a ser más empatico, responsable y puntual."
good,"Now this was a great starting job to get a good feel of the real world. Not everyone is nice or generous, but you learn to deal with situations work hard and fast and keep a smile on all at the same time. Plus the food is great."
good,It’s a great job if you want to keep moving and busy. I learned how to multi task much better than I could before and I always enjoyed the friendly fast paced environment.
good,"the job itself is decent, i have help from my coworkers, and my managers if needed, i’ve been working here about a year and five to six months, and i don’t have much to complain about at work"
good,"Overall a positive experience.  Pay and bonus were good.  Life balance was good with the expectation of a 50 hr work week.  You will be measured across many different business areas, that will challenge you, while also teaching you the many facets of the casual dining restaurant business."
good,"The co workers were nice and the pay was good for the hours I worked after school. It was very stressful for me though, the restaurant is constantly busy so being a hostess is kind of hard when you have to buss all the tables alone and also seat customers as they come in and find a balance between which sections to seat them in. The employees are all very close and friendly"
good,"Every Chili's varies by location. I've worked at three. Considering all there differences, they also share similarities. They care about their employees and their guests. Their a no tolerance company so everyone that works there wants to, no partner calling out or never showing up. You don't pay for walked out tabs. You get treated with respect, as long as you give it."
good,"This was a very fast paced work environment for most of the day, sometimes we would be slow and have a little bit of down time to get cleaning done or other important things, but we were always busy which is how I like to be while working."
good,Chillis was a good place to work while in college. the extra cash was helpful when you cannot work a full-time schedule and meshing it with your classes
good,"Good Job Good People. High Values. Very fast paced and overwhelming at times but also can be laid back  certain times, never not  busy though. strong team work and leadership in the workplace"
good,"I worked with this company for 6 years. During the time I worked for this company, I was able to work at multiple locations. Some of those locations were thriving and others were suffering. You always hear that the only thing that maters is location and that was 100% the case with this restaurant chain. When the area around the chili's was thriving and positive than the management and team members were also. If the area around the restaurants are awful and abandoned than so where the team members and management."
good,"The company itself is awesome, too much favoritisms between management and servers.  Some servers take tables from other servers when they know guest are good tipper. As a hostess I’m aware who had last table if their are (two servers.) They walk by their dirty table and don’t clean Guests  goes on wait list  (I clean)        "
good,"Easy entry level job, flexible job schedule, room to expand beyond one position."
good,I enjoyed the opportunity given to me at chilis. I learned what it takes to be a good manager. The best part of the opportunity was growing with a wonderful team.
good,Easy going for the most part yet stressful during lunch and dinner rush food was good and employees were very understandable as well as management. Side note good work environment if you are just starting out looking for a job
good,"Es una franquicia muy buena, siguen los estándares de limpieza y son muy puntuales."
good,"A typical day at Chili's wasn't too bad. Always busy, so you always have to be prepared and have your station stocked. Some managers truly care and will be helpful, other managers won't care at all. General manager at my store was so worried about labor costs that no one rarely got overtime because he was more concerned about getting his own raise than paying the good cooks that would actually work any over time money. The hardest part is putting up with the typical restaurant environment - super busy and can and will cause you stress even if you think you know how to handle it. Eventually, the stress will get to you, or they will over schedule and change your days off frequently so they can have what's best for them, not for you. If you're lucky enough to have one or two assistant managers that care, you'll be okay. Some of the benefits do include getting to eat for free and if you're a full time worker for a year or so you do get to become eligible for some kind of health care benefits. Overall, not that bad, just got to stay focused and don't let the stress get to you."
good,the managers were very nice and helped a lot but people would not show up for their shifts causing us to be down a person making it harder on everyone.
good,"It's again, your typical serving job. Same as any other chain restaurant. Greet your table, get their drinks, food order, bring drinks, bring food, triple check they are doing well, they say yes, blah blah blah. They are getting ready to leave and the next table sits down for you to start the same thing over again."
good,"I enjoyed working at Chili's for the time I was there. If it were not for dire circumstances, I would still be there."
good,Clock in and stock up all the stations and then prepare for the shift. Then work throughout your shift providing hot and fast food for our guests. Then you must always keep your workplace clean and orderly.
good,"Chilis is a fast paced enviroment "
good,I enjoyed working at chili’s bar and grill. Not all of the staff were friendly or team friendly. But I made good money and met some good people while I worked for them.
good,"It was a good place to work. However, a very physical job but overall was pleased with my experience at Chili's. I would recommend this establishment to friends and family."
good,I worked for Chili's for 10 years and truly loved it. It helped me to become more outgoing and definitely improved my multi-tasking skills. You can make as much as you are willing to work and move up into bartending and cocktail. Great experience overall.
good,"Great company, fun environment, great benefits. Management is engaging. Offer free education, business management programs, legal help, retirement programs, additional benefits for management involving travel and fun"
good,I learned that this work space can be difficult to handle at first but it will reward you in the end. My co workers are like family to me and then with tips you can walk out with over one hundred dollars in tips in one night.
good,"Its corporate at it's best.  Its stressful, its fast, theres no room for interpretation.."
good,"Chili's was definitely the most fun job I've ever worked at. They really made you feel safe and at home by always helping you out, but the customers can be really mean and you live off of tips so a bad day could really mess up your finances"
good,"A typical day at work for me would start by me being a bit early to work to make sure I have enough time to get ready before my shift starts, clocking in and making sure I’m ready to work. Through out the shift I make sure to give my 100%, work as a team, communicate with my co-workers and enjoy what I’m doing."
good,"It all depends ok the management.  I transferred to another chilis and the management is so different than Huntsville.  The managers at chilis in Huntsville TX actually care about their employees and guests. They , along with my coworkers,  made it a wonderful place to work."
good,"Chili's is a good place to work. I have not been there for long yet, but everything has been going good so far. Chili's has some of the best people working for them. Although it will always be job turnover, the long term employee's are true Chili heads."
good,A good place to gain some experience and skills. A fast paced enironment with extremely flexible schedules for both part a d full time. Always opportunites to be promoted.
good,"On a closing shift for a server, the hours in which you work vary on how busy the restaurant is and how many guests there are during peak hours and close to closing hours. The more guests you serve the more tips you take home, and vice versa."
good,"I enjoyed working there. Some nights I made grSome nights, not so much. I enjoyed my time there.Management genuinleyncares about their employee's well being!"
good,Constant management change at many levels makes for unstable environment. They do care about employees but changes makes for uncertain future. Great benefits.
good,"Lots to learn everyday fast paced changing environment accountability across the restaurant live cultural beliefs taking care of every guest teamwork,  all hands on deck"
good,Its honestly not a bad place but your work environment depends on who you work with and the managers. Some chills will be expecting a lot from you and other don't.
good,Working at Chilis is a lot of fun. Work days are easy for the most part. Stress at times but not for extended hours. Managment is not strict but are firm.
good,It was great. Some managers sucked and made the experience towards the end really bad and for that I didn’t really like it anymore. But when I first started it was so fun and the best time. I met a few people that hold such a special place in my heart.
good,A typical day at chili's is pretty easy going. It pays well and you never feel too stressed out with the job or task that you have to do. It offers pretty decent discounts and the atmosphere is always chill
good,gaining extra detail information advise experience about food cleanness safety guest handling guest journey is the main thing which i learning in this company
good,"Perfect for teens and young adults looking to make extra money. Fast paced, easy and simple. Back of house is the heart of the house. Treat your cooks respectfully and you'll get the same in return"
good,love of the food while working at chili's. great managers workers and customers making for a great experience. hardest part is fighting through high volume shifts which is made easier by the great team work.
good,Coworkers are good and friendly  they all know What they doing  when it gets busy we all work together  is. A team  servers wise they are all work  very professional
good,"Truly one of the best kitchens I’ve ever worked in."
good,Fun people. Great work environment. Matured from work experience. Enjoyed my co-workers and the management. Hardest part of the job was to remain focused and be on your toes.
good,Chilis can be a very busy place.. especially on the weekends. The money is nice but you definitely have to work for it.................................................
good,"I have really enjoyed my time with this company. While I did not like how our general manager treated employees, I got along very well with the other 3 managers at my location, as well as the other employees. The environment is fast-paced, but is still a lot of fun and it was a perfect job to have while in college."
good,"Culture is a big factor at Brinker, but can also be a dis-satisfier if you're not in the right clique or don't have the right advocates.  Operating culture good, food culture good."
good,"The hours at this job can be overwhelming at times; however, there is opportunity to learn in many areas of the business and personal growth is added in."
good,"Chili’s was my first waitressing job and I absolutely loved it. I was a shy person before working there, it really opened me up. If you want to make good money the weekends are where it’s at for sure."
good,"The job can be a hit or miss because servers work solely off tips  if you are not busy, you aren’t making much money either. Sometimes sections can be unfair."
good,Love working with management and crew. Steady pace job. Very clean and prepared. There is always something to do. This company is for those who enjoys being in the kitchen.
good,"Clock into work, go to the kitchen and see what's on the screen. After that prep everything you will need for the next shift. Measure ingredients and clean up."
good,I have worked for chilis off and on for the years. I started my career with them in the 90's. I have always met a lot of fun people working there. Haven't had a bad experience yet.
good,My coworkers were amazing but mangers wouldn’t help sometimes and just left you to do everything with 2 servers on and then complain that everything isn’t perfect. Also you and one other person would be taking care of 14-20 tables that would be sat too close together time wise.
good,"Job was fun and fast paced, Remember the different types of Margaritas was easier than I thought. "
good,"Chilis is a very fast passed environment that continues to push ahead of the rest of the restaurant industry. Hourly team members love it, Salaried team members are over worked and misunderstood."
good,"Part-time working here it's amazing nice place  nice discounts great managers and team work"
good,"Flexibility in scheduling from week to week.  There is usually a good work atmosphere depending on which location you join. Fast paced, high volume serving"
good,I am forever grateful to Chili's for the opportunity they gave me through out my years of employment.  I learned a lot and meet amazing leaders/co-workers that I know consider friends.  They provide flexible schedules and enforce a culture of making people feel special.
good,Great job. Gives you the opportunity to grow in the positions offered. Team work is great and very cooperative. If you work hard you will make your money.
good,"It is very tiring to work in a food and beverage industry especially during holiday seasons, but I can say that Saleh Bin Lahej Group of Company ""Chilis"" is one of the reason why I became a strong woman here in Dubai. They taught me how to manage my time and how to be more productive."
good,"Give it your all,fun place to work and great people, good benefits 401k paid time off the employees are very carrying they help each other everyone there likes what they do and if you work real hard you can move up the chain of command real fast"
good,"Working at several different chili’s across the country, I learned various methods of prep and service. Coupled with, a passion for food cultivated through a team mentality, chili’s is a great place to work and eat."
good,I was a server there for 4 years. In my experience there I learned a lot about working as a team and working with the public.  It was a nice place to work.
good,A work day begins nicely with a hello from all staff that was present. Managers were always there so they always had something to say. Whether it was a question or not. If we arrived early we couls just sit or help out other staff until our shift began. Oncethe shift begun for lets say a line cook things usually involved checking how stocked we were and getting refills on anything that needed to be. Making sure measuring utensils and knives were all clean. Once all that was ready some orders popped up on screen by then so the night usually had orders at all times. Near the end of the night shifts we began slowly putting away any or our supplies and so on. Cleaning began for night shifts. Floors were brushed and dried. Stations were wiped and pans and measuring cups were put awqy in their proper locations. Managers helped as needed. Usually hard days only occures when weekends had rushes but that's expected. Other times it was when the restaurant held deals like an example being fajita monday. Positives thinga included drinks and the stqff really. Really positive people.
good,"Chili’s is a great place to work for those who are interested in working a fast paced and fun environment. They let me transfer from different stores, pick my days off, and even do homework during slow hours."
good,It would be a good job for someone who didn't go to college and pay rent and bills More suitable for teens to be a host guaranteed good hours and can work way up to become a waiter which pays more
good,"I have no complaints, I absolutely loved it there. Staff was friendly and everyone worked together, management is flexible and will work with you regarding any situation an employee might be facing."
good,The people were always funny and joking around. Being under pressure and working. You never take anything to heart. Start over with every table. You cant please everyone. Just smile and work hard. I was appreciated.
good,"Every day is hectic. The dinner rush is ay least two hours in which you are working a station on your own with a full screen and everyone needing something from you. Other people help when they can. The people make it all worth it. As a cook you get a free meal with every shift, whatever you want on the menu"
good,"People are not treated fairly by their ability to do the job, but more so on who they favor.  Schedules are not performance based and there is no regularity."
good,we really worked well together from the kitchen to the bar. we had a great time with another. I highly recommend this place to others. when I stop by now for dinner and some of the old staff know I'm there everyone comes out to run conversation.
good,I enjoyed my time working for Chili's. The crew is more like a family than the average company setting that I have worked for. I was able to work at a few alternate locations and also was a certified trainer.
good,"It can be a great place to work as long as everyone is on the right page. The culture is amazing and you do meet great people, it is a fast place learning environment with no room for slacking."
good,"It was a great way to learn how from people from all walks of life, how to demonstrate leadership, and how to learn time management skills. I will always value the lessons learned at the company."
good,It was a fast pace and high volume restaurant. my co workers were great team player were we work as a unit for a great work enviorment. managers were always available to help and assist with anything the employees need it.
good,"Hardest Part of this job is catching a breath. The environment is fast and steady, catching on to the computer and menu are a breeze. Make sure the orders are correct before you leave the table."
good,Good environment to work in and fun people and staff. Always a good day to make tips and always a friendly competition between coworkers. Some slow days but weekends are hot.
good,Very fast pace environment. you were responsible for a lot of work for the small amount you got paid for as a server. The environment was fun and the people were awesome to work with.
good,U loved the people I worked with and the people I worked for.  They helped me when I wasn't feeling good. They help you when you need help. They work with you to better your work experience
good,"The company is great about scheduling and truly goes out of their way to ensure that they are catering to their employees, there can be occasional issues but that is typically on the employees end for not planning ahead of time, not the management's. The job as a server is extremely high stress but does pay the bills if you do not have a college degree or the ability to get a job that requires one. Would recommend as a stepping stone job while in school or in between more advanced career paths. That said, the ability to advance in the job or company is fairly limited. As a server it's just like any other commission related job; you get out of it what you put into it assuming the clientele tips you what they should, which some do, and some do not."
good,"Cool place to work, great coworkers, and decent management. Great place to work if you don't mind talking to and getting to know new people. Hope you enjoy."
good,Chilis taught me a lot and gave me a lot of room to grow and advance. Great benefits. I had a poor experience with one of the managers there and felt a lack of support as a GM in my final year.
good,I love Chili's and the staff.  Working for this company has been a pleasure. The staff makes the shift go by easier and more fun and the customers make going to work better.
good,There will be days business is slow and you don't make much money. The weekends are very busy and you have to learn fast peace. Management is strict in some areas. Restaurant will be a restaurant.
good,"Working at Chilis was very fasted passed when it was busy, but overall it was a fun place to work. Working there helped improve my customer service skills."
good,"I felt that I was being treated unfairly here. Also, with my work ethic, I feel that I should've been paid more. I gave a lot of effort to my job there."
good,"Chili's will always be a place that has amazing energy. They always have some sort of deals going on and they just have amazing service. Working for Chili's was a great experience. It has taught me how to deal with all sorts of people with different personalities, how to multitask and how to communicate better. When working at Chili's, you grasp onto friendship with your coworkers and friendship is something that we need to cherish forever. That's the vibe that Chili's brings to its' guests. When working, you also get to make peoples day and once you see that smile on that guest's face, it makes your whole day and you will never want to see an upset guest again. Making the guest feel special is your main goal as a host. Once you clock out at the end of your shift, and think back, you realized that you have done your duty as a host. It's a great feeling."
good,"The restaurant business is very fast paced. However, when I worked there the culture was real. The managers were cool. The staff was competitive, but still fun, and had each others backs. You have to be there ready to work. The best servers I've known are those who put the effort in to know what they are serving, have the ability to entertain the guest, and at the same time, keep up with what they need next."
good,"chilis was a great, fun place to work which came with a lot of knowledge to gain about the industry, but unfortunately , senior management had poor communication skills which caused the location to get shut down."
good,Chili's is a decent place to work. I like how you don't have to split tips and get to have your own tables. I think the management could be way better when it comes to personal things.
good,"this is a great place to have a nice quiet dinner, drink a few drinks and watch sports or whatever else happens to be on the tv at that particular time."
good,The kitchen is hardcore and very fast paced. The pay and hours available are great. Hard to balance work-life and home-life though with crazy hours and random shifts. The environment can get to you sometimes but overall it wasn't bad.
good,"Mondays & Thursdays were always slower paced and were calm days at work"
good,its a nice place to be. the atmosphere is great.who can beat all happy hour.  the food is good and the people are even better. but management needs to be fixed
good,Chilies was a good place to work if you don't mind spending your work hours on the weekend. It can be difficult to learn serving at first but it becomes an easy job over time.
good,I personally worked in two different locations under different managers and I enjoyed it both times. The environment is fast-paced as in any other restaurant but it is usually not too stressful.
good,"I enjoyed working there. It was a college job, nothing special but very laid back and easy work environment. Wish I could go back and live the simple life and work there forever."
good,"A typical day on the job for me as a host was checking my floor plan to see what tables were already in use, what servers were on that day, and what zone I was to seat first. I would then communicate via headset to the staff how many open menus there were, and what zones were open. As a host, I was also the bus-boy, so I would clean off tables that needed it, then I would continue to greet and seat parties as they came in the restaurant. As the QA, I was the middle-man between the chefs' table and the customers'. I would stand at the windows looking into the kitchen, and follow every order that would come through on the screen, and communicate that with the cooks in the back. I would also handle questions and requests about the food from the servers. I learned how to talk to people, whether it was a party of one person, or a family of nineteen. Whether it was my manager who I answered to, or the cooks who I needed answers from. The GM was a tough-love leader, he cared about the overall successes as a team that we'd accomplish, however most managers were very nice, soft-spoken, light-hearted people. The hardest parts of the job were managing all the orders as QA when the restaurant was extremely busy, and as a host, it was difficult for me to manage big groups as the wait-lists grew on very busy nights."
good,awesome atmosphere. managers are wonderful. team work is important and encouraged. hours arenusually negotiable and flexible. overall a nice place to work.
good,I learned great custumer satisfaction and how to achieve up-standing work ethic. I learned greeting and waiting tables. The workplace culture is up-beat and caring for what customers need.
good,I like the culture part of chili's and the family part of the company. Always getting involved with its guest and city. Very fast placed but you make great money too which was awesome.
good,"I like working in a restaurant, its very rewarding when you work hard. Working with my co workers is the best feeling.  The communication could be better though."
good,It’s was a nice working experience the management wasn’t really all there though. I enjoyed interacting with the customers they kept me wanting to work.
good,"It was a fun environment to work in. Very high paced work place and it can be stressful at times, but all chain restaurants are that way. You get out of it what you put into it."
good,As soon as I got to work i started to stock my work station. The management was very helpful to get me what I needed for my shift. Everyone is super friendly and helpful. The hardest part of the job is when it gets busy and everything seems hectic. The people are by far the best part.
good,I am proud to say I was a service manager for child's center city Philadelphia. The experiences and lessons taught to me there helped prepare me for my future in this industry.
good,I created custom restaurant prototype designs in existing build space. I had to make it fit to space and often made field trips to measure and do CA work. I really enjoyed this job.
good,KLCC outlet are too busy sometimes but it is nice for me. Nice environment which make you to work harder than other people. Sometimes customers gave tips for your services.
good,"A typical work day is tedious opening and closing side-work, taking customers orders, running food, and cleaning throughout the day. I learned how to work with my ""Pepperpal"" (section partner) and how to serve in a corporate workplace. The management is very friendly and care about their employees just as much as they do their customers. The workplace culture is a family friendly sports bar with great food. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with rude customers. The most enjoyable part of the job would be working with a great staff!"
good,Teammates care for one another and try to help each other.  Management does not focus enough on the employees and hiring enough labor to cover all areas of the business.  Most employees have to do several job duties during any one given shift and can sometimes be overwhelming to the employees
good,"I loved my coworkers. Management was always very nice including the GM Andrew. Pay wasn't great, but for a high school student wasn't bad. The real only preobelm I ever had was with scheduling. You worked what they need and nothing less. Was very hard to find someone to cover a shift if needed."
good,"I had quite a few managers, some better than others- depends where you live. The food isn't priced very high, therefore, many do not tip that well. Treat your regulars well and they will reciprocate"
good,"Chili's was a very friendly, family like environment. The management team was always easy to approach with any problems or concerns. Growth within the company was always encouraged."
good,"we are on daily time record of from opening till closing and two shift from 9 to 5 and 5 to 10. whole week with day off. i have learned that when i purchase order some parts, its it hard for the management to release fund because they don't have any idea on what are the important for the equipment to function. management was so poor that they have no capability to run a shift. work place place is huge that can accommodate 520 guest. the hardest part is when in full force that i came to rescue whether in kitchen place , in dish-washing place, or even in the dining area. the enjoyable part is when we are part of the companies basketball tournament."
good,Es un lugar muy bueno para empezar a ganar experiencia ya que aprendes a ser mças responsable.
good,"I worked for Chilis at the same restaurant for 18 years. I felt now was a good time for a change.  Chili’s was a good company to work for, but I felt like i had gotten stagnate and wanted more challenge"
good,Chili's wasn't my ideal place of work but it is less restricting as far as corporate establishments go. The management provide clear rules and regulations and they are enforced but not live by.
good,"It was an overall good place to work.  Management decisions were not logical.  I was rehire-able, but I was not informed until a few months afterward."
good,"The only thing about it is that, the management are kinds sketchy and don't like to work around your scheduling if you have another job. It gets really bust and the guests don't like to understand that."
good,"A typical day at work, you meet several people.  Sometimes there are  people from other parts of the country traveling.  You learn a lot about people.  Some people just need to vent.  Management is cool.  You get to interact with people from many different cultures.  The hardest part of the job is nothing really."
good,A good honest hard days work is very valued here!  Hands on working and coaching culture which is very good for building relationships with crewmembers.
good,"My typical day involves prepping the dining room for service, minimal prep work in the kitchen, and most of all, creating an inviting atmosphere for my customers. I've learned from working at  restaurant and serving all different types of people, that no matter how impeccable my service may be, some people are generous and compassionate while many do not possess these qualities. I'd say the hardest part of my job is keeping a cheery demeanor when customers are being unreasonably rude. It's also frustrating when my earnings for the day don't match the effort I put out for my customers. It bugs me that my whole paycheck depends on the generosity of total strangers, and some just don't know how to tip PROPERLY, let alone be generous. The most enjoyable part of my workday is being around my co-workers. Our workplace culture is great. They're fun people with a good sense of humor, but when it's time to work, we get it done. Everyone's a team player, helps each other out, and does whatever necessary to keep the operation running properly and smoothly. My manager is absolutely incredible. He's very fair, looks out for the best interest of his employees, and he knows how to manage extremely stressful situations with poise and composure."
good,"Chili's was my first job and it was the best anyone could ask for, for a first job. The pay was only minimum wage and the hours weren't always great, but at a first job its hard to be picky."
good,Chilis is a fun place to work. The culture is very good for employees and the management usually knows how to take care of you. You are paid fairly for what you do and there is room for advancement.
good,this job is fine if you just want something to do and need extra cash for things. This job allows me to make what i need for the week and if you work harder it shows with your pay.
good,"Every time i went to chilis, i went in to work hard and do the best i could. Despite being just the dishwasher, i took my job seriously and made my job to make others job easier. Through working hard i was moved to fry cook. Goes to show that if you work hard and communicate with your superiors, then you will have flexibility and respect."
good,"My time with this company was wonderful.....plenty of advancement opportunities,good management,all around a fun place to work.the pay and hours was very fair and i really felt integral to the company."
good,Cleaned cooking equipment. cooked and prepped. Quick paced. Great management. Well organized. Free meal at the end of shift. Willing to work with your schedule.
good,Excelente empresa buenas pagaste y disfrute de privilegios tales como ascensos
good,"Its fast paced if you're a server, but if your willing to work, there is lots of money to be made if you're good with people and good at your job. The people are awesome and it's finally under great management and they are flexible with hours."
good,"It was a great way to get my feet wet into the restaurant industry. I was able to cross train a lot with hostess, take-out, and serving. Only wished that some of the employees weren't always trying to fight"
good,Management needs work. I worked there for almost a year and did not receive one raise. I worked two stations by myself and did not get paid for all the work I put in.
good,Best of an opperatunity to learn a different culture of food made by cooks Healthy invierment in going to planes for a better way of job related skills..
good,"Una empresa que tiene bun plan de desarrollo. Todos los dias habia cosas nuevas que aprender, muchos de los jefes te guiaban o te direccionaban. En realidad durante 8 años ame mi trabajo y di todo por la marca. Lo realmenre dificil era encontrar un equilibrio entre tu vida familiar y laboral"
good,"Loved my job at Chili's, unfortunately there was to many employees and not enough hours. Was not making the money I needed and was competitive with ITR scores and hours."
good,"I had a great experience with the management team, i loved my coworkers i made life long friends here. I recommend this company for someone who wishes to become management or become better at their serving craft but as for making a million dollars it wont happen here."
good,encargado de una linea de cocina en la preparacion de platillos
good,"Working at Chilis for couples years now has taught me numerous lessons such as teamwork, customer service and loyalty. Management and staff is great, team work service comes a lot at play. The hardest part of the job is not having good stable pay when serving. The energy and teammates is my favorite part of my job, everybody is different and have amazing qualities."
good,Chilis was the best I left chilis for mote better prospect. I have learned a lot in chilis about culinary.  Specially standard operating provedure and sanitation and food evalution . I have gave me opotunity to complete serve safe certification from ANSI
good,"Great food, great environment, usually filled with upbeat customers who are just there to socialize and watch a sporting even with a beer.  Great pay on most nights."
good,"The job is a good opportunity for those who are starting to work."
good,Great staff that respond very well to the demands of a restaurant environment. Have established an effective working place where all employees are treated with respect
good,"~Waiting tables and balancing side work was easy"
good,I will start by saying that the only problem I've ever had working here is the management scheduling. Best place I've worked at by far! The pay makes the works well worth it. They are very big on helping each other out. Do not apply here if you don't like kids they are a family friendly place and almost everyone who comes in has a kid with them too.
good,"Working in Chilis is really a Great Opportunity , I am what I am now because of all the trainings I've learned from them and i can say  that Chillis is one of the best and good training Ground when it comes to Hospitality. They know the value of the word Teamwork and they will mold you on how to be the Best among the rest. The management is Good. Im happy to be a part of Chilis family and i will apply what I've learned to my Future work place."
good,They fired me because i didn't know enough and i wasn't even there that long and they wanted me to know absolutely everything on the menu and wanted me to know all the bar drinks by heart.
good,"They will work you to death if you let them, so hours were never an issue except I worked too much for my liking. The managers are all extremely nice and understanding and most of the other employees are friendly too unless you get on their bad side. Only bad side is no breaks at all, except to go to the bathroom but you don't get to sit down at all for 8 hours. Cooks get free food while working, and you get 50% off food when you come while not working. You get a raise every 6 months you work there though I'm not sure how much."
good,Its fun in the work but its hard specially on weekends due to full volume of our guest but still its a great experience for me. I know all my experience in this company is I can be use in a future purpose.
good,great job for entry level cooks who want to make a lil money. prep guys know what they're doing. everything is awesome. good people. i loved it. i need a new job.
good,It was a great work environment I worked 6 hours a day 5 days a week I learned how to dishwash and patience the hardest part of the job was when I would first get there
good,"A day at Chili's is very busy and frustrating. I love cooking, but there's no set standards of work and nothing ever goes as planned. After years of being a quality inspector I am used to things being done by the book and with the absolute best intentions. At Chili's I do not feel that it has a good structure."
good,They are like one big happy family.  Everyone helps each other whether at work or outside of work.  The mangers will do all they can to help employees advance within the company who is interested.
good,"Even though this company is a chain, they were always awesome. Fast pace, always moving which is nice. Management always backed you up if needed. If you were good at your job, tips. money was great."
good,"I really think that this is an Underpaying Company. When it comes to appreciation  i found it Fake and Lame towards the employees. Good thing, they offer healthcare."
good,Enjoyed working there as a stepping stone. General manager was awesome. Great atmosphere to gain experience. Cool coworkers and chill dress code. Teamwork is a must.
good,They are a good company to work for they had one of the best management teams I have ever worked for and they have every good food I could never get enough
good,"Entrenador, de mesero, hostess, ayud.de mesero, impartía clínicas en reglas y servicios adicionales, daylis en alimentos y bebidas. Apoyo en inventarios, diario, semanal y mensual."
good,Good place to work. Average pay balanced work schedule. Management training needs to be re-developed. most locations are high volume. customer focus orientated
good,You'll be on your feet a good amount which is great for anyone who enjoys a quick work week.  The day should go by quick during busy hours. The management staff does a great job at listening to their employees and working hard to make sure the restaurant is run well.
good,Chili's was a great experience. I learned a ton about management and about what great guest service should be.  The management team and team members were awesome!
good,As far as restaurants go it is okay. I personally hate kitchen work. Management is fair. If you do your job like your supposed to they take care of you.
good,"The management in this restaurant is still to this day (three years later), some of the best I have encountered. They are flexible, understanding, and for the most part very helpful. The business is consistent. You won't make high end serving money, but you will know what you will walk out with for the most part. The staff is also very close and I became close friends with many! But on the other hand, there were times where it became extremely catty (like most serving jobs). Now the clientele is good for the most part, but I also experienced some of the worst clientele in the industry here. Take the good with the bad."
good,I got my feet wet for the first time in the service industry on one of the busiest weekends of the year: Valentine's Day. I fell in love with the idea of making money and having a good time doing so. This was the best job I ever had!
good,"I liked the way we were headed and the culture of accountability that was a staple. Claimed they wanted us to have a good quality of life though it was rare, if ever, to see the one weekend a month off that was expected. Also, had many turnaround shifts."
good,"It was okay, but ziosk surveys are a big deal. If your surveys aren't good enough, they give you food running shifts and cut your hours. The management is great, the kitchen can be a little rocky at times, but other than that it's okay."
good,Chili's is a great place to make fast cash. They are always busy and the tips are great. Easy to pick up shifts or change them around. Made tons of friends from chili's. The hardest part is being so short handed and trying to keep everyone pleased
good,"I enjoyed working here, it was fun and there was lots of opportunities to learn. The days that were busy, could be overwhelming, and gave room for growth. Bussing tables, bring people in to their seats, maintaining the general cleanliness of the restaurant, running food and being dynamic and adaptable were all part of a typical day at work. There were many friendly people who welcomed me into the workplace culture."
good,Me working here I loved it. The people were so friendly and they all seemed so nice. Everybody took their jobs serious and made sure that the customers came first. Fast and Great service.
good,"The business is in decline so that limits the opportunities for employees.  Senior management team is relatively new and seem to have moved away from the values the company was founded on, but lip service to the values is still there."
good,"Great team environment, learned a lot, promoted quickly. Sometimes they threw you in jobs you were not quite ready to work or had training in which made that part difficult."
good,"Chili's is a wonderful company to work for. They are fun and upbeat and provide amazing food. They focus on quality, and if your management team is good, then you will have a wonderful time working here."
good,I enjoyed meeting new people. Had a few regular customers come in and they was always a blessing to talk to. Managers was understanding and sometimes made the place a fun plave to work.
good,Chili's is like Family. Great place to make new friends and grow your career. Culture is outstanding and the benefits are on par with industry standard.
good,"A typical day is laughing with good people. I learned how to have a good attitude toward all. Management is very good, always giving support. Watching out for everyone."
good,I made a good amount of money here from tips the environment was nice and clean and simple. Really all you have to do is be friendly and considerate of your costomers!
good,"My typical day at work is coming in, I either start with prepping food or cleaning any dirty tables and getting ready for my host shift. I answer phones and use the computer/cashier when I work the To-Go shift. I also run food for the servers. What I've learned is how to deal with customers and how to please them when there is a conflict. My managers are usually good but they aren't very good with scheduling. The hardest part of my job is the days when people are grumpy and are giving me a hard time. The most enjoyable part is working with my co-workers, they help me out when I have a problem and they teach me how to be patient with customers."
good,a typical day is pretty busy there's a great atmosphere management it is overall a great place to work i enjoy it the food is great the customers are enhh but that every restaurant  business that there is.
good,Everyone was helpful and friendly. The hardest part of the job was during the peak hours because the restaurant got filled quickly and the difficult labor.
good,Great place to work at chilli IN houma la...I ran the kitchen area I did whatever was necessary to get job done ....I got awards for things I learned the in and outside of a restaurant that I would have never thought.. One day hope to have own business like chilis
good,"I have been an employee of Chili's for seven years and it is a great company to work for. Fun environment, fast paced, the top Chili's Restaurant in the Nation. i have great co-workers but my management team definitely needs work. overall i have enjoyed my time there. the hardest part of my job is dealing with different personalities and the most enjoyable part of my job is making people happy, whether its with food or with drinks."
good,"truly enjoyed the earlier times with chilis ,company had excellent quality of life , i would check in the servers and do my line checks set my to do list for myself and cooks dishes and servers , have the rally meeting explain new items test new items , get feed back from star and set the moment for the day"
good,The managers and people that I work with are fun as well as understanding.  Management has built a good rapport with employees.  A great place to keep busy with tables and meet great people.
good,I have spent most of my adult life working for this company.  It has afforded me many opportunities. It has also taught me so much more about business and this industry than I ever thought possible.
good,"I worked as a hostess while in high school and the job was super easy except on Friday nights around dinner time. The servers need to be seated in a rotating order, if not servers will be upset. When you see a guest coming, open the door and greet them. after you have settled down for the day wash windows and clean the bathroom. Not much to the job."
good,"A fun place to work. Management staff is easy to work with, however there is no room for advancement or job security. The hours are flexible so you can work and go to school or take care of a family"
good,I am so grateful to have had the opportunity to have worked at Chilis. I learned so much about myself and about the company and its responsibilities. I had tons of fun an gained an experience that'll stay with me for a lifetime.
good,"A typical day at work you never know what you are going to do. I was a busser and I did anything from roll silverware, buss tables, to wash dishes. I learned a lot of things. One of the things I learned is how to manage a fast paced job and get along with management. The management kept you on the move however they did not communicate well with each other. The hardest part of the job was figuring out what they really wanted you to do next. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people."
good,Typically 3-8 hour shifts. Work rate helps job go by fast. Co-workers are helpful and fun. Hardest part is dealing with rude customers. 50% off food.
good,"Great Place to get a work. just not much money in it. the people are nice. much diversity......and it can be fun to learn from and this thing keeps asking for more info on chillis so the serve tacos, nachos, burritos, rice, beans, avocado, and fries. Go check em out!!"
good,"Chili's is a fun place to work, I love everyone I work with and everyone who comes to eat. The managers are really cool but also mean business. Unfortunately I see a lot of managers come and go. I enjoy working at Chili's but I am looking for a full time job now."
good,"A typical day at Chili's was nothing more than enjoyable. Hectic at times but good energy, good food, and a willingness to provide excellent service, from both management and staff."
good,"My average serving day usually consisted of having 12 tables during a shift. I learned how to communicate well with others, both satisfied and dissatisfied guests. The managers at Chili's have been there for me since day one and their good role models. The hardest part of the job deals with understanding the menu, but after that it wasn't too difficult. The most enjoyable part was the overall experience I had as a server and the knowledge I took away with it."
good,Fun and exciting place to work! Always something new every day. Great work environment with great people which was a result of great management and training.
good,"Mi labor por esta empresa fue buena en términos generales, se podía ganar más dinero de manera rápida, consistía básicamente saber cocinar en más de un área. Existía facilidad de ascender."
good,"This job was amazing until managers had to use a tool that no-one knew how to use. People never showing up, Managers always working in the kitchen. Never enough help. Maintaining 9% labor."
good,"Typical day at Chili's is fun and easy."
good,"it was a great experience of working with some of the toughest G.M.'s I have ever had the pleasure of working with.  But still....in some restaurants worked/trained, it also was the most ""stressful""  time in my life. Though ""Thank God"" that I overcame all obstacles and situations that needed his guidance to help."
good,"Chili's is a great company with a strong culture, high standards and a solid training program.  Anyone who has the opportunity to work for Brinker international will be a better leader because of their experiences with in the organization."
good,Good for a student that needs to make some money. Not a desirable pay rate based on your current work position. Would suggest higher pay based on positions.
good,Good place to work and learn good work pace. Stays busy and time goes by fast. The managers have high standards and are helpful. They keep the kitchen very clean. Good communication between front and back of house.
good,"As far as a serving job this is the easiest one I have had, business is generally steady but still easy to maintain. For the work you do the pay is pretty fair, management is very flexible with scheduling."
good,"Great place to serve and bartend at if you want to make good consistent money.  Management team and culture is up to par.  Being a corporate run restaurant, there were a few things that I didn't always agree with, but it never completely ruined my experience there.  Definitely a place where the possibility to advance in position is common."
good,Chili's was a fun environment with a lot of great people. As I stayed there longer new job opportunities were available to me.
good,"Chili's made a huge impact on me, being my first serving job, mainly because of the people i work with. I now realize the meaning of the word teamwork in a workplace. At every turn, someone is there to lend a helping hand and from friends i've talked to at many restaurants, waiters fend for themselves. Each day i walk in i know i'm going to turn someone's day around, just as they would turn mine."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of general custodial duties if slow, running food, taking orders, being organized. I learned a lot of skills not limited to communication skills, urgency to prioritize, be more confident and outgoing. I felt management did a very good job at keeping customers happy and ""reversing"" the damage if there was ever a mistake. My co-workers made my day so much more exciting and have me excited to go to work."
good,"My co workers and managers made it a fun place to work at with flexible scheduling. I really enjoyed working with the guests, It thought me a lot about team work, multitasking and communication skills. There's a chain that goes on in the restaurant industry and we all have to rely on each other to get through the day. There was a lot of different obstacles we had to face everyday. We dealt with different types of guests, which made it complicated at times. I've learned to use different stragedies to improve their experience with the business."
good,At the time I worked there the overall company lacked focus.  Since then a big turnaround on profits for shareholders etc.  A fun atmosphere to work in.  Food quality has improved.  Leader in technology and innovation.
good,I enjoyed working here. It helped me with my verbal skills and helped me to be able to deal with ALL people. I served tables my last five years there. It was a fast pace environment. I would take care of about three to eight tables at a time depending on how busy we were.
good,Like the location due to it being close to the college I go to. Always a busy weekend with concerts and football games near by.
good,"While the job duties are the same, every day is different. Great place to let your personality shine. Managers are friendly and down to earth. Work schedule is flexible. The plethora of employees makes for a fun and friendly work environment. Food is awesome. With all the different kinds of customers, needy, friendly, annoyed, content, it is challenging to mold your approach to best deal with and please the guests. For me, the favorite part of the job is to handle complicated guests, who normally always have something to complain about. I enjoy the challenge to satisfy them to the point where it would be impossible for them to be displeased with their experience."
good,Great company to work for! I knew many coworkers who have worked with the company for 5-10 years because they enjoyed and respected it so much! Opportunity to make good money if you are willing to put in the work.
good,"buen lugar para trabajar a corto plazo. buen equipo de trabajo. pero no siempre se ganaba buenas propinas, mas se repartian con otros empleados."
good,Fun and exciting work environment. Cool and nice coworkers and management. Typical server drawback would be unsteady income.
good,"greeting with a big smile, upselling, and friendly communication with the guest."
good,This a great job for college students looking to make quick cash everyday you walk through those doors. The pace can be very slow some day or very busy at a moments notice. Overall it's an ok place to work.
good,I liked working here. The waiters and managers were very friendly. The hours were flexible and left time available for other things such as school or other jobs.
good,A typical day at work was serving various customers with a good attitude. Making the sure they feel comfortable and have a good experience. I learned a lot about myself as far as being patient and courteous to people. The management was very nice and organized as far as dealing with a variety of people on a daily basis. The hardest part of the job was definitely clocking out. I loved the daily experiences I had when working there. I enjoyed everything about working at Chili's. From the enviornment to the staff.
good,it was a great work experience and I would probably still be working there if it weren't for medical conditions. They keep up the standards and are great at listening to needs of the employees.
good,"Had a chance to prepare a variety of foods according to customers' orders or supervisors' instructions, following approved procedures.Package take-out foods and/or serve food to customers.Portion and wrap the food, or place it directly on plates for service to patrons. Place food trays over food warmers for immediate service, or store them in refrigerated storage cabinets."
good,"There was always a lot of interesting people to interact with. The management and co workers changed frequently as is common in restaurants. I learned to adapt and to find comfort in the routine of guests coming to enjoy good food and service. I appreciated the different individuals I worked with, but mostly I enjoyed being able to teach the newbies how to be the best they could be."
good,Perform all the essential duties of my job description while making sure proper sanitation and food handling skills are present .
good,"The customers are the most enjoyable part of work. They make your day go by fast, and they give great conversations. I loved to communicate with customers that came through the door just to see what they are coming in for. Whether it was to celebrate any special occasion or anything else."
good,i truly loved being a server for chilis it was a very big learning experience for me. Chili's taught me how to work productively in a fast pace environment and id love to work there again.
good,The restaurant business is a tough hustle. The hours are long the pay is minimal - other than the tips and believe me you are going to jump through flaming hoops for those. I learned how to really prioritize what's important customer wise. Everything revolves around serving the customer. Doing this correctly requires being prepared before hand so as to deliver the best possible experience.
good,"A typical day at work was always busy we were understaffed with server's but we had enough hostesses at the time. Management knew kind of what they were doing at least some of the managers did. The hardest part of the job was the ""hostesses"" had to pick up all the slack from the other employees I felt like."
good,"Typical day, greet customers as soon as they come in escort to table introduce new promotions and servers. Learned how to prioritize time by having customers seated as soon as possible. Managed seating areas seating specifically the number of people in the party."
good,Very great customer service experience as well as multitasking. Always with my team had high energy which would make work very easier specially at tougher and busy times
good,The work at Chili's was cool for the most part. The management I guess you can say.... Depends on who's there for the most part half they was good people.
good,"The company places too much emphasis on outside experience and not enough on veteran Chiliheads abilities and desires to climb the ladder. I've worked for both good and bad managers, the bad are the ones from outside companies who don't buy into Chilis Culture and beliefs. They tend to be able to talk the talk, especially to their superiors, when it comes to walking the walk, they fall flat and create a larger problem for staff and guests. "
good,"Chili's taught me a numerous amount of lessons on teamwork and finishing tasks on time. In the restaurant business, time goes quickly but it is critical. A typical day at work included cleaning, serving, assisting guests with orders, and handling money in tips. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the guests and seeing the smiles on their faces when they had finished a great meal."
good,"i mostly serve guests all day long."
good,"A typical day at the job is very busy usually. I have learned to be organized, quick, enjoyable. My co-workers are the best and I really like them. The hardest part of the job is managing huge crowds of people desperate waiting for a table and not to be able to satisfy them because there is no space and I like to make people happy. The most enjoyable part of my work is to make people happy and to please my managers."
good,"Interact  with co-workers and come up with a plan for the day in other to make sure the job is done right.Seek assistance from management and get their input into any decision we come up with.As the day goes by we get feedback from the costumers to see how satisfied they were and also to help us improve.Interacting with co-workers,preparing and serving the food and engaging into conversations with the costumers is the most fun part of the job.I learned how to manage my emotions during difficult times and when things are not going the way it is suppose to.Staying calm and collective and also acting professionally.Hardest part of the job is to keep up with the demand and making sure each and every costumer is satisfied."
good,"The guests are the most enjoyable part of my experience working here.  You never know what you're going to get with a lot of them indeed.  I learned to do my job even better than my previous restaurant endeavors because of the fast pace of the restaurant, which is always a plus in experience.  The management here was pretty good. They will teach you and train you on what you need to know and give you all the tools you need to succeed in the business.  I would say the only downside or hard part of the job of being a server is those days where you don't make what you want to make.  That part really just depends on the amount of business you have but it also makes a difference in how well you are able to accomodate your guests while you're there to make it the best you can for them and yourself as well."
good,"Working at Chilis for 8 years has helped shape the person that I am today and has helped me build great customer service skills. I am a great server and take pride in my services. However, it was a better job for me while I was attending college. As a college graduate it doesn't suite me anymore. I no longer care to run around for hours on end to barely make ends meet at home. I have enjoyed all the people I have worked with over the years, and many of them are people I will never forget. My management has varied over the years, and there are definitely ones I wish I still worked with or whom I base my work ethic off of."
good,Very clean and well run (depending on management).  Tips are so-so in this area unless you work your tail off...
good,"Have worked with Chili's for a long time. Good environment, positive people ..."
good,"started serving and 9 months later became manager.  Have managed all aspects of restuarant from bar, kitchen, fron of house, and training"
good,"On a typical day, I went to work and was always greeted by great coworkers and obnoxious guest."
good,As my first restaurant job it was a provided great experience to understand the culture of restaurants.
good,nice place to work learned about a lot of foods. a little unorganized but over all a good paycheck
good,A typical day at work includes solving problems in a customer service environment while juggling other tasks such as maintaining a cleanly work place and keeping necessary items stocked. It really takes good time management skills as well as being able to do several tasks at once in a friendly frame of mind. I have gained much patience working with this job and it has truly been a humbling experience. I've learned to always consider others whether it may be my coworkers or my customers. Our management staff does their best to stay on the same page with one another and keep a valid understanding of communication with one another as well as their employers. The hardest part of the job would probably be cleaning up after an extremely long and tiring shift. The most rewarding part of the job is providing the customers with a friendly and enjoyable place to dine in and making them feel welcomed and satisfied.
good,"A typical day at work, for me, consists of a roughly 7 1/2 hour shift talking to and taking care of up to 200 people. I have learned how to communicate with several different personality types and how to handle decent amounts of cash. The hardest and the most enjoyable part of the job is definitely the guests. Working in a restaurant you learn that no matter how wrong the guest is you keep that smile and do everything possible to make them happy and coming back."
good,My typical day consisted waiting on tables in a fast paced restaurant. I learned to multi-task in a fast paced restaurant.The managers were approachable. My co-workers were all friendly and hard working people. The hardest part of the job was learning to multi-task in a fast paced environment. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting compliments from my guests.
good,At chilli's I learned how to correctly address customers and allow them to receive the best customer service I can provide.
good,Overall was pretty good job. Great co-workers and good staff in the kitchen to help me further do my job at my best. Only hard part lots of hrs but the money was well worth it.
good,"I enjoy what I do because I have a passion for food. If your co-workers see that you enjoy what you do it should reflect on them and the restaurant. Some of my opening responsibilities included : set up prep lists for cooks, count the safe and log petty cash. Print up daily rosters for FOH and BOH and view sales for previous year for the day to run labor. I've learned to be the calm eye of the storm as many situations call for immediate rational solutions."
good,"Clean Tables. Clean menus. Seat guest. "
good,"This was AGES ago, but they always took care of us and were very practical about everything. Never asked too much of anyone and gave us opportunities to move up if we wanted. We had great relationships with the wait staff and managers. "
good,It is always something at this job. My co workers are nice and welcoming. The hardest part is when some of your co workers does not want to cooperate and help and you have to do it yourself.
good,Enjoyed my time at Chili's. allowed me a flexible schedule to finish school and afford my daily living expenses.
good,"Chilis is a very good work environment I have been here for four years now, and even though every day is stressfull at the end of the day you learn the value of hard work, communication skills, and ensuring great quality to the guests"
good,Fast-paced environment. Top of the line customer service.
good,"Greeted people as the walked in, took orders, delivered food, organized money."
good,"Nice neighborhood restaurant"
good,"Typical day at work was cleaning the front area (menus, and pagers), sitting customers day at the tables, cleaning the restaurant and helping pass out food and drinks if needed. I learned customer service and how to be more organized. Management were all very nice and helped you when you needed it. Co-workers were like family. Hardest part was working by yourself when it got extremely busy. Most enjoyable was meeting new people."
good,"Chili's was great to work for, but being a manager of a restaurant is hard work. I met great people and learned a lot about the business of a corporate restaurant. They provided monthly bonuses on top of yearly salary. The hours worked are long but go fast because you are on your feet the whole time, never stopping to think. A challenge is dealing with the expectations of the public. At the time, I wanted to work a 40 hour a week job, with weekends off."
good,"Busy, I've learned many things working at Chili's as in the high volume I worked in. Stressful sometimes due to short staff, management or kitchen being backed up. My co workers were my family and still very much are. I really did not have hard days at work only when we were beyond busy and it was hard to get help from management/co workers. The most enjoyable part of my job were the guests I got to take care of as in meeting new people and hearing there stories."
good,It is one of the better restaurants I have worked on.  Low check average so lots of running around.
good,Chilis is an excellent family restaurant. Everyone works as a team and gets the job done.
good,"Although the managers were easy to get along with and the cooks were helpful and respectful, the server to server relations could have been better."
good,"Host has to be a busser and a host when alone up front and you only get paid for hosting which is only 8 an hour. An if servers like you they might give you a tip, but don't always count on that."
good,"-Easy to stay busy & be productive"
good,Chili's was a great learning experience for a new manager.  I gained valuable experience in the FOH as well as BOH.
good,The Greatest part about working at this job was working with hard working team players like my self.
good,"It was fun, fast paced work environment. There was a perfect balance between fun and work. I learned to work at a high pace, and learned how to do it well."
good,Being a server/ host is a fun job unless you run across rude customers or employees involve personal life and business. Through serving and hosting I met people from various regions and businesses. I also learned good communication skills and patience.
good,A typical day at work consists of providing the best possible customer service to customers. It is a fast pace job and one is always busy accomodating others. Co-workers and management are friendly and are always willing to help one another. Providing excellent service to individuals is our number one priority.
good,"customer service, hospitality, and multitasking within the food industry"
good,A fun place to work. Hard work was often rewarded with benefits and incentives
good,"Fun place to work, but not challenging enough for me.  Expanded my skills in full service dining"
good,"Chili's wasn't a bad job at all, and my schedule was always a little different so I wasn't doing one thing all the time. The management was decent, but overall really nice to everyone and treated their employees well. Usually I would come in early in the morning to help with prep and sometimes truck, or I would work in the afternoons. The co-workers I worked with were great and everyone generally got along."
good,"I took orders and served food to customers, I welcomed them warmly and make sure they have a 'happy meal'. Occasionally when customers were celebrating birthday, a group of us gathered around them and sang happy birthday to the birthday person. It was a fun job overall."
good,"Food prep- Come in early make sure my work space is clean and organized, then start on my prep work. One food item to the next. "
good,"As assistant manager it is my responsibility to count the drawers that will go to the cashiers, inventory, food orders, hourly team member time management, and ensuring that hourly team members are executing their tasks correctly. The management team has changed twice while I have been the kitchen manager.  The general manager and other assistant manager were switched out my second year as kitchen manager.  This year both assistant manager and general manager quit leaving only me, the kitchen manager, to run the entire establishment until summer gave us leave.  The hardest part of my job would be making sure I time the hourly team members thirty minute breaks efficiently.  The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to make a guest happy and making sure they have enjoyed their time at Chili's Too."
good,Busy. Cutting Edge Restaurant. This company trains excellent managers. No Life balance though
good,As any wait job it can get stressful but its also super fun. people of claremore chili's are awesome inside and outside of work. work there if its close to you as sometimes the drive is not worth it. usually a very busy place. tips are always steady. management def has favorites and it shows majorly!!!!!!!!! just get in good with at least 1 manager and your life at chilis will be good. 
good,Loved my managers. Loved the money. Loved the people. the only reason i left was because i graduated.
good,"go to wrk to give 100% guest delight. i like the atmospehere and i like that not everyone is out for themselves"
good,"The hardest part about serving is having to deal with the idea of ""shooting the messenger."" As a server, you are the person to be blamed when a customer's food doesn't come out the way the customer expected. Even though you may have given the order to the cooks correctly, the cooks may have made the mistake, and you didn't catch it."
good,"Spend alot of time entering coupon codes for food servers, learned how much the industry is changing with new autmation, Management is okay but doesnt' follow through, I enjoy my time with the co-workers most of whom work hard,probably closing 15 shifts a month when other Manager's were doing any from 3-9, fast paced and all the reacurring guests and the benifits."
good,Overall enjoyed my employment looking for management outside of the restaurant industry
good,this is a great place to work. relaxed uniforms. fun people and it was in a supreme location for business.
good,"Chili's has been a great job while going to college. A typical day included waiting on multiple tables, teamwork, and handling and managing cash and credit sales."
good,"en los primeros dias de trabajo te entrenan y enseñan como funciona la empresa, los platillos del menu, como tratar a la gente, que hacer en caso de problemas, como por ejemplo; clientes disgustados, gran cantidad de movimiento entre otros para brindar un buen servicio."
good,Its a job! The GM is a nice guy. Co-workers became very close friends of mine.
good,I loved working at Chilis the enviroment was amazing and the people were so happy my co-workers and i got along and it was like a work- family place .
good,Chili's was a very fun place to be because there was always some action.
good,"I really dont have much to say about this job, its more of a job working environment instead of a place that you would enjoy going to daily."
good,My day starts in the evening hours. I stand by the door and great customers as they entered the resturant. I help as much as possible to make the customers fill confitable when seated. I learned that customer satisfication at Chillis is hard work and determination. Also learned how to manage the time and front of the resturant effictively. My co-workers where and still are the best at exacuting customer satification. The hardest part is when I had to leave. I mostly enjoyed the all the staff at chillis they where kind and caring people.
good,"A typical day at work includes serving guests and working with your team which includes managers, hosts, QAs and cooks. Chili's does not have bussers so you are responsible for that."
good,A great place to start your employment history. They co-workers create a family atomsphere. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with the variance in your income due to gratuity.
good,It s a pretty good place to work. It is hard to get a raise and I feel under appreciated there some times. The managers are all great. The hardest part of the job is sometimes you get those guests who are impossible to please. The most enjoyable part of the job is great guest compliments.
good,serving families and guests everyday to make them feel special about coming to the #1 bar and grill i also learned that there is no '' i '' in team and management is always there to pick up the slack whenever needed which is great plus the hardest/enjoyable part of this job is remembering orders and constructing them together
good,"Setting up certain things for the day, making sure everything goes smoothy and is correct, and keeping busy is a typical day at work. I have learned every way possible to keep busy, and how to handle stressful situations. My management team is great and understanding. My co-workers are great as well, although sometimes I wish certain people would care a little more about their job. The hardest part about the job is dealing with co-workers who don't care as much, but I keep my mind on my task and get what I need to get done. I love how positive our management team and it's nice to be appreciated."
good,It was a fun environment to work in. I was able to switch job titles easily. It was a true pleasure to work there
good,I've never loved a job as much as I did Chili's. You can make tons of money in very few days. Management and Staff are both amazing.
good,Getting to meet new people everyday
good,1. Greeted customers
good,Loved being young with an amazing Team
good,"Chili's is a typical restaurant if you want it to be. I am a very driven individual, so I tackled every position I could. This allowed me to learn the ins and outs of the restaurant industry and really understand the work necessary to succeed."
good,That's all there is to it. Good for meeting people and making some money on the side. Would never consider it a career though
good,"Its chilis... if you think it would be a fun place to work, then it would be"
good,"Fast-paced work environment where servers/bartenders serve 60-90 people per shift (on average). Must be able to multi-task as there are many things going on at once, and also patience is an important part of this position and of the restaurant industry in general."
good,I really enjoyed working with the management team at Chili's. I feel that I worked in the two best stores in the entire Brand.
good,"train and guide our new staff until they learn, maintain the sop of the restaurant, demo the new menu for the staff ingredients and cooking and prep procedure, controlling the cost and ordering"
good,"They were fun and friendly, and most of all fair. I liked the culture and all they had too offer as a company. The quality of food was awesome, and I had an overall great experience."
good,"Huummmm enough...🤔😊"
good,Aprendí  mucho de preparar todo la comida. Yo muy comunicativo con todo los trabajadores
good,only worked there for a couple months because i had to move states but over all loved woking there all my coworkers were very sweet and helpful.when i first started thre i was very nervous because it was a new job and all new people i got to work with but my manager and all my coworkers got me right on track and helped me learn very quickly.
good,Family fun with American favorites at you disposal.  Hand shaken crafted margaritas with TVs and great service available.  Flexible work hours and doesn't close late!  Great company to work for
good,"Though it was fun working here at Chili's, some people made the job difficult. The new manager had his favorites and if you weren't one of them, he didn't really care about you."
good,The food is great and our servers try and make sure our guests have the best experience possible. We take care of any problem our guest has and can accommodate anyone
good,Working at Chillis gave me the sense of stability. The manager was a fair-minded person and I enjoyed working for him. All the equipment I need it to do a good job was always provided
good,"At first pay good money and a lot of hours, but that was during the summer. Once Fall road around my hours got cut and I had to miss a lot of days of work whenever my son was born at 29 weeks. I was only in Fry station and every once in a while I'll be dishwasher but they never taught me how to do any other stations."
good,Great place to get your feet wet in the food service industry. They have a proven training program and love to promote from within. They will pressure you to push contest or drinks but it’s doable.
good,It was stressful during rushes but that was when you made the most money so it was worth it. You just have to be able to stay on top of all your responsibilities.
good,"Chili's open the door for me to learn how to be a good line cook and about team work if my manager needed someone to come in do to someone calling out he would call me and ask me to come in. That's what I like,at Chili's I always got good hours"
good,"Loved the people, hard work. Good managers, somewhat laid back but gets hectic during evening weekend shifts, slow in the summer months. Good place to work."
good,The people there are very nice. All three managers were very kind and fun to talk to. Everyone at chili’s became family to me. They all wished me well when I left
good,Being a dishwasher it gets lonely but you can listen to music but it is always going to be a face paced environment no matter the hour since dishes are always coming in.
good,Never a dull moment between prep and the amount of business traffic that goes through the doors. Great training and strong company standards to make sure everyone is taken care of from the guest to the heart of house.
good,"There is no doubt the Chili's brand focuses on the guest first and closely followed by the team member experience second.  First class systems are in place to assist the operators in delivering on KPIs.  Focusing on behaviors to drive metrics was the key to success, where leaders used focused feedback to deliver a consistent message to the team.  The culture is strong, keeping the job interesting and purposeful.  I was a leader for the brand for 23 years.  The skill I learned to master the most under the Chili's team was connecting with people in building a strong team that was aligned on expectations and motivated to deliver results."
good,Company cares about team members and work life balance average work week 55 hours. Fast paced environment that's always changing due to business levels.
good,I loved this job and all the people I worked with. It was the most difficult serving job I have ever had but it made me a better server and was very rewarding
good,Fast paced but doable and team oriented. Great management and can be a fun and productive place to work. Could be a bit more organized and perhaps a bit friendlier in terms of the back house but great place to work.
good,"I enjoyed working at Chili's and made lifelong friends over the many years I worked for them. It was a well organized corporate environment.  I was cross trained in multiple positions.  Only shortcoming was to receive my full time hours, I needed to work split shifts."
good,"great place to make money, you do make personal connections with co-workers and guest. Dress code is laid back, management is great! you'll love it here."
good,it's a fast paste work place always want you to stay busy at the time it had a bad manager but you can work through it. It's good for you to work ya way up to waiting on people.
good,I really like working at Chili's the management team is amazing and they help in all ways possible the only down fall is there training they are always to busy to give proper training to there cooks
good,Chilli’s is definitely a family environment you can expect more than one order at a time you can also meet people it’s friendly for the title I had it definitely require attention
good,Chilli’s hours for hosts and Togo is minimal and they usually have an absurd amount of hosts or Togo’s leaving everyone with one shift a week. The recent managers are very active and hard working.
good,work hard and make lots of money. Become part of a family. Changes were made to serving system and tablets were sometimes a pain. had contests on sales to win prizes and boost sales.
good,Chilis is an excellent place to work. You're going to find drama anywhere but it stays busy enough to do well. I bartended for several years. It's all a roll of the dice as I had awful managers make life terrible and when I relocated to another store the management was awesome.
good,"Good place to work. Flixable hours, long hours thou. Overall a nice place, can move up in the chain . overall good team work and skilled co-workers. Good people"
good,"Great benefits.  I wish they had a location closer to were I live.  Was going to build one close, but it got canceled.  Hopefully they will have plans to build one again."
good,Working with your coworkers and creating a bond through Chili's culture really makes a lasting impression and makes you want to go back.  Everyone works hard and we all have fun.
good,"A typical day of work for me would be getting to work on time, clocking on, and being a team member by helping in any way I could. I learned more then I expected. Started out as host, using communication skills, attention to detail, organization, and fast paced. Then to dish which is also fast paced, consistent, and multitasking. Trained in TOGO and QA in which you have to use your memory and attention to detail and a fast efficient pace. In cook I have learned to be fast, efficient and good at multitasking. I also said I was training for manager, although I was too young, but I learned about profits, sales, functions of the restaurant, counting the till. I learned a lot at Chili’s and hopefully my knowledge from there will help me along the way to my next job."
good,I worked for Chili's for three years and it taught me a lot about myself and it trained me to have a great work ethic. Our branch is one of the busiest in the country and it taught me how to work fast and precise. My team members and my managers turned out to be a second family. Overall I loved my time there.
good,"Wonderful work environment if you love serving others! Fast pace, exciting, great food!! Earn your way to the top! Not for everyone, must have tough skin, but overall wonderful company!!!"
good,I enjoyed working there especially since it was my very first job. I didn’t have any problems with anyone and the people I work with. Was an awesome team to be around.
good,"Not enough hours to make a living, it could have just been the one I worked at as it was not in the best area of town. Co-workers were awesome and would always help each other out."
good,"I enjoy working for Chili's. The restaurant itself has great energy, the team work within the restaurant is great. It feels like your apart of a much larger scheme when your working there."
good,"There was great diversity; people coming from all different kinds of backgrounds. I was able to further develop empathy and emotional management, courage to speak up when people were being treated unfairly, and communication skills to efficiently be the mediator whenever it was needed. Overall it was a wonderful experience that I will forever look back on as something that helped me build the strength I needed to follow my dreams."
good,Was a typical corporate casual dining experience. Worked a lot of hours and there was a lot of drama within management and staff. Unprofessional and inconsistant
good,"I really enjoyed working there. The people are mostly great and the place is pretty relaxed so long as you get the work done that you are supposed to do. Management is really great with the exception of a manager who switched personalities under pressure and would sometimes yell at people. "
good,Really enjoyed my role as Host and the teamwork between FOH & BOH. Unfortunately the availability of hours between employees limited compensation and growth.
good,"I started as a host and within a year and half had worked my way to becoming a bartender. Fun job with perks such as discounted food at all locations, great working atmosphere and fun contest with prizes. Hardest part of the job is the turnover rate, I've had more than 5 managers in the 5 years I've been with the company. On the other hand, hourly members tend to enjoy and keep their jobs more than salaried."
good,"it was a fun place to work but the hours were not very good. the managers were helpful, and all of the coworkers got along, but the hours just weren’t good."
good,"The volume is high at my Chilis store so I can turn tables fast and make loads of money in one night, but the actually company itself is very cheap with their labor and it is a lot of hard work. We run our own food, bus our own tables, bring our own clean dishes to the line, make our own soups and salads..and it can be EXHAUSTING. Some managers and coworkers are very helpful but most are not so much."
good,Fun relaxed place to work. Learn about most of the menu items. You also learn how to prepare food quickly and efficiently. People work together as a team and it is like a big family.
good,The only down fall of this job is our teams mates never prep for the next shift. Other than that I recommend people to work here everyday. Great customer service and communication
good,I enjoyed the amount of team work that was present when i worked at chilis. The hardest part of the job was putting up with rude coworkers. the best part of the job was having something to do that is productive through out the day.
good,Good place to work . had the best time there the food is great. the staff amazing.. they took time to make sure you are set to work . wall the crew is fun
good,"very good place to work, very good company. the managers are very easy going and accommodating. great work atmosphere. its very fast paced and very stimulating"
good,"Es uná gran experiencia, que te enseña a poder manejar  varias áreas de la misma empresa que te ayudan a crecer"
good,Chilis can be a great environment to work in but it all depends on the demographic of the town you are in. Because of their cheaper prices the tend to attract cheaper guest with more demands and worse attitudes.
good,would be better if management dont talk down on you. they need workers to motivate each other.You can learn alot and have fun. the hardest part of the job is holidays when the restaurant is really busy. they will work with your schedule.
good,"It is a nice and relaxed environment, lots of good workers and wonderful managers, only complaint is the communication is not the best. My average day at work is to clock in and cook and get through the lunch or dinner rush then clean the restaurant at the end of the night."
good,Chili’s is non-invasive in my personal life. The hours are flexible for my schedule as a high school student and varsity athlete. I have a great relationship with my managers and coworkers. This job has taught me about hospitality and I have enjoyed working there.
good,A typical day consist of going in and getting straight to work. I learned how to get food out the kitchen into the window in less than 8 minutes. Management was usually split between four different managers and each had their own unique style of managing. The hardest part of the job was managing orders and the most enjoyable part was staying busy and earning a decent livable salary.
good,Fun and fast paced environment. Great managers. Good location for business. The training could be more thorough and sometimes there are bad hires that slip thru the cracks
good,"Chilis is rad, that is why i have been here for 8 years, it pays the bills! The typical work day can vary depending on position, bartending or working the floor in the restaurant. The management crew has always been nice and helpful to everyone. The job has gotten much easier over the years, since learned how to serve well. But, the hardest part of the job would be keeping up with the pace and dealing with those more rude customers. The enjoyable parts of the job do trump the hard ones though. Tips, working with friends, meeting new people constantly, the list goes on. Chilis is a cool place to work if you can handle the server life!!"
good,Pretty strong workplace culture with a flexible schedule. They provided ample opportunities to move up and off benefits as well. It is also very easy to transfer within the company as I worked for 4 different stores in 3 cities.
good,I've learned quite a lot in my years at Chili's. The most important of which is how to take care of the guests and the team members.The most enjoyable part of my day is to see the satisfaction on the guests face when they know they have received great service and great food!
good,"Through working at Chili's I have acquired multiple skills pertaining to punctuality, multitasking, teamwork, customer service, and efficiency. While it was initially challenging to master carrying a tray,  I really enjoyed the camaraderie and social aspect of working in the restaurant industry."

good,It was a fun place to work alotta of oportunity just wasnt enough for me. I had to .ovenforward with my plans i reccomend anybody beginnig in cooking tonwork there
good,"A typical day involves checking in and finding your serving section. Greeting guests and taking drink orders and food orders with the intent of up-selling. It can be stressful, especially since the company had required the stores to tighten up on labor, meaning that many times we are understaffed."
good,"we would sometimes roll out new menu items and try them ourselves, that was pretty cool. We stayed busy during the rush hours so time flew by. the employess were great to work with"
good,Nice job to have if you need to make ends meet. The atmosphere is very calm and relaxed. I believe if you work hard enough and are dedicated then you'll succeed.
good,Great place to work if you have the right management the hourly pay is low but typically you can make it up in with the tips you make. The dresscode is casual
good,"Pay is fair, but the management is poor. Call outs are a problem and leave the restaurant understaffed but expect us to work days that are out of our availability"
good,Cuentas con beneficio de propinas diarias al desempeñar la posición de mesera.
good,I had fun working in chilis amazing culture they have. They have their own standard in giving great customer service. All staff are working together to be productive
good,I had a very positive experience at Brinker.  Enjoyed learning from those around me and felt I was recognized for a job well done.  The only negative was the work/life balance wasn't always something that was important to management
good,"The location I worked at was wonderful. managers were great for the most part, the GM was fantastic. I learned a lot about the food in general and the food industry. It was fast paced most of the time because we are right next to a concert venue. I enjoyed the people, they were chill and I made a few friends working there. Pay is good for a hostess and they work with your hours."
good,The coworkers were friendly everyone helped everyone. the chilis I worked at you were pretty much a lifer. Not may people came and went. the hours are very very  very long and u will be very tired.
good,It is a fun place to work at yet challenging although it can sometimes be stressful due to difficult customers. The manager are willing to help in anyway they can and want to see you succeed.
good,I had a great experience working at chili's.  The management was wonderful all 3 years i worked there.  When i had my first child the manager had no problem with me taking 12 weeks of maternity and was also willing to let me wait tables during the last 8 weeks of my pregnancy.
good,Busy location.  Almost no down time.  Made day go by quickly.  Fun work environment.  Long hours. Enjoyed all positions and most of my superiors. Would do it again.
good,"A typical day busting tables, cleaning the restrooms, greeting guest . I ran the host stand and trained new hires. I also helped run food for some of the servers when the place was really busy and that was a lot."
good,This is a job that will keep you busy and give you a chance to please your guest the way you feel they would enjoy it. Very good money you can make at the end of the shift.

good,Keeping a good attitude will make working at Chilis enjoyable. It can be stressful and very fast-paced but if you think 2 steps ahead then it won't be so bad.
good,Overall a decent place to work. The free meal during work shift is awesome as well as the discounts received when off the clock and dinning from chilis.
good,"While I was at Chili's for such a long time, I had moved up as far as the store would allow which was unfortunately still with no benefits.  I do think that their training style is wonderful and I would recommend using it in any company."
good,"As long as you serve well, you will enjoy working for this company. They train well and show you how they want things done specific to their companies style."
good,"Working as a hostess here was relatively easy, at times stressful when busy, but servers are for the most part great and asking for days off was usually never an issue."

Overall, Chili's is great for personal development and offers opportunities to cross train."
good,It was great! I would do it again anytime if in management.It was fast paced team oriented environment! Challenging every service professional to be positive and fun.
good,"Since working at Chili's, the thing that struck me the most, was the workplace culture. We do things such as daily rally meetings to get everyone on the same page and boost morale, beach clean-ups for the community, margarita team parties, team member birthday parties and other various team building yet social and fun group events. They try to be a 'family' and it definitely shows.v"

good,"Working at Chilis was usually fast-paced and busy, especially on the weekends and during holiday rushes. This was slightly mitigated by a strong team-focused environment where team members were expected to work together and help each other out. Management was usually available in the case of issues with either guests or fellow team members."
good,Working at Chili's downtown was very busy easy to turn tables and make money. Worked with a good crew that would make going to work fun. Corporate rules to follow
good,This job had good management and was very organized in the objective of bringing people in and most importantly having them come back. As a college job it gave me good costumer focused experience.
good,"I work at the Osage Beach location, and it's amazing. I had to relocate due to getting married, and started at the Arnold location. They always had too many servers on staff and the bartenders were never in a hurry to put customer service above their own needs. "
good,Great place to make quick money. Not much room for advancement. Good mangers that cared about their employees. Ability to make customers happy and upselling products.
good,"Great place to work as a stepping stone in cooking, very team oriented work place, friendly and helpful management, learning basics of cooking and cleanliness of the kitchen"
good,"Professional and committed to development. Great benefits"
good,A good place to get easy quick cash and also flexibility to have a personal life. A couple of months of the year can be really slow but overall it can be worth it.

good,Great place to work. Just looking to work Monday through Friday now. No real issues. They care about quality of life I stayed for 13 years. Just want to spend more time at home.
good,"Thumbs Up!"
good,"I was always helping out my compatriots,  and covering shifts. They actually asked me to be management,  but the money was not good. I always worked open to close."
good,"Dishwashed, Prepped, and cooked everything the right way. I learned how to cook meats and learned the fast-pace at a restaurant. I loved working with my co-workers and getting the job done efficiently."

good,"Great company, always looking to promote within. Fun atmosphere, great training implemented for new hires. Fast paced, but long hours - hard to spend time with family ."
good,"My 2 years at Chilis were amazing and fun. Learned different ways to cook Sirloin steaks, Salmon, burgers and other great foods on the flat top. Always a fast pace working here. Lots of morning prep to be done including 30 lexans of chips, guacamoli, and portioning of raw meats, frozen products.But because of the fast pace and sense of urgency, chilis at times were stressful when we were understaffed or not much help was given to prepare for the shift ahead.

good,I really liked working at chilis it was a fun environment and I would request it to anyone with a new job. It was great and I made lots of tips ! It was awesome

good,This job at chilis is mainly for part time. You never know how the pace if the restaurant is going to be. The weekend shifts are great. This job just requires a lot of extra work to do after each shift. The coworkers are great. Good enviroment.
good,I enjoy working at Chilli's. I get to utilize all my Culinary school skills. The atmosphere is quick paced & there is a strong enforced structure behind the team.
good,I loved working for this company and loved the food I ended up having a baby and needed to be put on bed rest and then took time off to raise my baby and then just ended up going to a mom n pop kitchen to be able to make different home style foods but this place was great with training n adding new iteams
good,"Rewarding for folks that enjoy fast pace. This is not a job for people that are not willing to give 100%. Good culture, although culture and job expectations are not always consistent"

good,I enjoyed working for Chilis very. much. Had I not had some severe personal life issues I feel that I could still be working there. Good employees and great management team.
good,Everybody worked as a team. Management was amazing always had reward for the top seller. All around great staff. The hardest part of the job was the side work. What I liked most was my regulars that came each and every week.
good,"Worked there for a few months , I learned a lot and really enjoyed the experience.  They were beer helpful and understanding with personall issues. I'd live to work with them again ."
good,Chili's is not a bad company to work for. You will make decent money and you don't need any serving experience to start working there. The people that work there are pretty cool and most of the managers are great. They are flexible with scheduling and will listen to your problems for the most part.
good,"GREAT place to work must be very fast, learn fast, and good with people. The environment is a younger place and could be negative if you dont remain optimistic"

good,"starting in CHILIS as a food server was a great challenge that i accepted and with in 5 months i got promoted as a manager who is handling all the restaurant both FOH and HOH , our culture there was one team one goal and the guest satisfaction is our first priority, the hardest part of the job that sometimes i got angry whenever i see a guest going out of my place with a closed face then i feel like i lost the challenge but the most enjoyable part there was when i am heading to the guest and i heard a great comments about our place"
good,"They give the employees many benefits and some activities such as store outings, general assembly, and family day. the trainers teaches their trainees what is the standard and necessary in order to contribute well to the company."
good,i want new challange in my carrer .i work for more than 6 years under name of chilis .i look for new improvement in my knowledge abd my life.i learn how to manage hoh and foh and how to control the cost
good,"I enjoyed working at Chili's. The managers were helpful but firm. I made decent money from tips. The most difficult part was how much the on and off seasons differed. Making money during the summer was difficult where I lived but the winter and spring usually made up for it. Overall, I would recommend this workplace."
good,They treat their staff well with lots of support from all levels of management.  Lots of growth opportunity and very competitive salaries.  Benefits are not the best.
good,the most enjoyable part of my job was cooking and the employees were very awesome good team work but management was not at all good in the way they ran the store but over all great place to work I enjoyed it
good,Tiene un ambiente agradable donde uno se puede desvolver sin ningún tipo de problema.
good,"Chili's was a very stressful environment but made up by my coworkers, no matter how chaotic the shift was, we always bring each other up and made the most out of it. I loved my management as well, they were great leaders. Being a host, i tried pleasing both servers and customers and that can be tricky."
good,I feel like its horrible for beginners or someone who hasn't been a server in years. Its really fast paced. But I haven't given up. I actually enjoy the challenge.
good,I enjoy working with people. My cultural diversity allows me to strive in every day experiences. When given the chance I excel for the business I work for.
good,"This was a nice job for me, fun and easy and i learned a lot from the managers who taught me there. They we're friendly and treated me like family and were sad when i had to leave ."
good,"I worked 10+ hours a day.  I over saw daily operations of whole restaurant to include the following: customer service, staffing, supply orders, scheduling, inventory daily on high food cost items, reconciled daily deposits, managed labor, ensured food safety.  I loved working with my staff and assisting in developing them.  I had many wonderful customers who came in during my shifts to see me.  I loved being successful at hitting or exceeding monthly budgets with my fellow managers.  The hardest part of the job was the hours and constantly being on call for issues that arise when off."
good,Ambiente divertido y social . Nos dan la oportunidad de interactuar con nuestro grupo de trabajo . A estar unidos y siempre llegar a un mismo fin .
good,"I would love to work there again if i was given a chance to be a server and show i could have been a great one ! I studied and worked hard there while working a second job ! i loved them both but chilis was awesome , great people and good management !"
good,"Really did enjoy working for the company. Management was amazing, co-workers were always helpful and friendly. Taught me a lot in customer service. Hardest part of the job would have been having to explain to people why the wait was so long."
good,"Opening and setting up for lunch, control cost centers and motivate employees.  friendly and challenging work environment. the hardest part of the job is to keep all employees on the same page while maintaining SMART goals.  very rewarding to see the operations 100% efficienct and all guest having an exceptional experience."
good,Working at Chili's was a fun job. Everyone is encourage to really work as a team to ensure a smooth shift. No day is the same.
good,I learned a lot about food service in the time i was working there. The management was pretty solid and they always gave recognition to people who worked hard.
good,I have worked at Chilis for about 10 years.  The management is friendly and hard working.  It is easy to make money if you are a good server or bartender.  I would recommend to anyone under the age of 30
good,Had some really great managers that surrounded me with partners easy to work with and thrive with. Really easy company to work for in my own opinion. :)
good,Not too strict. Laid back management and staff. Hardest part is the high stress some people deal with it better than others.
good,"In this company the staff is very co-operative. Everybody help each other. But there is no source of accomdation, transportation etc in this company. That's the main purpose to leaving this company"
good,I love working at chili's. Very fast paced. A place I could be self sufficient and self motivated. As long as I wasn't over stepping management boundaries I was able to just go with it. Which I loved because I was constantly being micro managed.  I made great money. The other employees were all fun & easy to get along with. Over all a great place to work & eat.
good,This is a very fast pace environment. Never a dull moment and the guests are considered family. I loved my co-workers and management isn't paid enough for their hectic days but an overall good company to work at.
good,I'm  learning  a lot. All this years That I work here.    0the manager there are good to everyone  there..and I Lear to deal with people. More..
good,"The culture is split between back of house (cooks, prep cooks, and the dish washer) and front of house (servers, bartenders, and hosts).   Management handles everything in between and leads both areas.  "
good,"Chilli's was a fun place to work, I hated to leave but I was offered a better opportunity. The staff was fun ro work around we all got along like family."
good,"Chili's often changes its menu, making it frustrating to guests who come back for a recently deleted item. Shifts are generally easy, as you have a shared zone with another server. You both help each other take care of all the tables in your section, even if they are not your own. There are no bussers so you have to clean your own section and tables throughout the shift. Management is fair, however they tend to pick favorites and rarely promote. The hardest part of the job would involve consistently cleaning and turning tables even though you are very busy and don't have time. This goes especially for the lounge area, as people will still sit at dirty tables and it is up to you to clean them. However, other servers and managers will generally be helpful during these times. The easiest part of the job is getting the schedule you want, as the scheduling manager is understanding and will schedule you (most of the time) what you need and want. It is also easy to request of if you give two weeks in advance."
good,It's a fun workplace but DON'T do parties!! Chilis doesn't allow gratuity for any type of parties so you will always have a group of 20-40 people in these parties and not tip no matter how good of a server you are.
good,Chillis is a very fast pace job. There is never a moment where you have nothing to do. I learned to work great as a team to get the job done right. The manager's are very Strick about working as a team so the job will get done correctly. It is good they are like that BC when u work as a team stuff gets done so much better than one person trying to do it his are her self. The hardest part about the job was being so busy at times but it's also the best thing BC you always stay busy with something to do.
good,I love Brinker International. I support Our Cultural Beliefs and Brand Standards but struggle with frequent management changes in my location.
good,"I generally enjoy working at Chili's and I get along with all of my coworkers. I like a majority of the management team aside from our newest member. She's not an awful person, she is just very condescending and rude a majority of the time and quite frankly tends to belittle those around her."
good,"Chili's has a unique and empowering culture of accountability. Compensation and benefits were solid, but work/life balance was less than ideal. The direction the brand is moving didn't align with my personal values."
good,"Great for personal development. I have had the pleasure of working with the best management staff the company has to offer and a great team. The service industry can be difficult, demanding, and stressful at times. I have met some of the most amazing people working within this company, who have encouraged me and have had my back at every turn throughout my collegiate career. I say all of this, though I am not convinced in the direction the company is headed. Overall Chili's has been an amazing company to work for, I am thankful for the time that they have allowed me to spend with them and my fellow coworkers."
good,"This is my first job in a restaurant and although I went in with no real idea of how hugely demanding it would be, I quickly discovered that I was pretty much unprepared. Eventually though, I learned to pick up the pace a lot and since then it has become A LOT easier. The restaurant is often very busy and so there can be tons of stuff to push through. The managers and other employees are for the most part very friendly and accommodating and the hours are very flexible. The pay is also good for what the job is (comparatively to the same job other places). I get free drinks and often the kitchen sends me food. The workspace is accommodating to staying very organized. When they are less busy, there is prep work they have me do (which I have no problems with). On the other side, closing can be a big pain, there is no point in taking breaks (you really do not want to leave the dish pit if you don't want to come back to a thousand extra dishes after just 10 minutes when they are busy), some folks will give you a very hard time if you are too slow, and the servers can be extremely inconsiderate with basically just haphazardly heaving dishes on you when it gets busy, but all considering I could immagine there being much worse places to have this kind of job at. I also have some physical problems and the management is always willing to be of good assistance when they see that I am struggling in any way too much. The managers here are pretty awesome. This is overall a great place to start out in."
good,Very busy days and evenings. Favorite part of the job was going to work to see my co-worker whom I enjoyed working with very much and greeting the public. Hardest part of the job was working many late nights. Management was decent for awhile
good,Great opportunity to make money if you are hard worker. Great opportunity to meet people. Work environment was very fast pace and fun. Great preparation for anyone who enjoys customer service.
good,"fun place, enjoyed working with everyone from front of the house to the back of the house. management was good and bad, they changed often. I preferred lunch shift over dinner shift, better workers in the kitchen during day versus night shift."
good,I really enjoy working here but I am ready to move on to something different. This job is fast paced but they work really well with your schedule and want you to succeed.
good,"Great food, great staff, great pay. Busy weekends to make lots of tips. Guests are nice, we have lots of regulars. All co-workers are a family, we hangout outside of work."
good,"A typical day would be coming to a pile of dishes. "
good,"The work days were either super busy and i'm talking 12 tables at a time, or super slow more like 2 tables at a time. This job really taught me a lot though. I've never been put under so much pressure in the food and beverage industry more than I have at this job. Most of the co-workers would help each other out tremendously, because we all cared for each other and wanted the best for one another. I have to say I felt like I worked so much that my fellow co-workers and some management was family to me. We all got along for the most part, we all knew each others significant others. This job really helped me open up to people whether I was bar-tending, serving, or doing side work with some body. There has been days where I would   take the whole restaurant by myself or with another server during a rush. The amount of tables seemed endless (13+) but it was a relief to know that you had people working with you as a team to get things done (management/another server). Over all I'm not to fond of the GM but the other managers were spectacular and I wish them the best."
good,"Chill is a great place to work.  They are willing to meet the need of the customer.  The customer is always right."
good,"I had some of the best co-workers that you could imagine! The tips you could earn were pretty decent; however, with all the menu changes that occur on a weekly basis, it drove some customers out.  Management and the Area Directors were always trying to improve the company.  Chili's is an excellent place to start out at, and to introduce oneself to the restaurant business."
good,"Very stressful, decently compensated. Must be good at your job. Benefits are ok. flexible schedule. The job is very up and down with pay because it is tip based."
good,"Typically I stand at the hostess stand and either roll silverware, bust tables, or fold kids menus until people come inside. I learned not all other employees are always respectful to or around the customers which is irritating. The hardest part for me was trying to overlook or fix the situations. The most enjoyable part for me was greeting and checking on the customers."
good,"For my first job it was very fun and competitive. Although there was little training some of my co-workers gave me valuable tips and advice to help me improve. I enjoyed working with them and even helped out when possible, as for the management they were very understanding and were able to work with my school schedule. What I learned from this experience was to listen to my peers when they gave me constructive criticism, and time management."
good,"This was a very interesting job considering all the people i dealt with. I learned a lot of social skill at this job and also about multi tasking. I learned how to mix drinks and how to deal with unruly customers. The management was amazing and the co-workers were even better. The hardest part of this job was dealing with some guest, but at the same time that was the most enjoyable."
good,I was with Chili's as a server first and was able to quickly move up the ladder into the management realm. The team was good overall. The hours were long and hard but the overall experience was great.
good,All the managers were very understanding and kind and my fellow employees always tried to lighten the work load or mood.  the work was hard but the hours were good.  The restaurant itself was very sanitary and well ran.
good,Chilis is a staple and it can only be said with my career there that the only reason I left was for a new experience to advance my career.
good,"A typical day at works starts with being greeted by my many loving co workers, maybe even a hug or two and shared laughs. I will then proceed to the front of the dining room to view my floor chart to see what section I am to be responsible for for the night. I then go into the kitchen to see what my running side work and closing side work would be. I then go into the office if I am not able to find one of my caring managers on the floor to see who I will be working with for the night. The most enjoyable part of my job are  my co workers, since working at Chili's I understand that your coworkers really do become your family. I have been through so much while working there and they all are willing to be a shoulder and offer support. The hardest part of the job is the decline in business and still coming in with a positive outlook."
good,a typical day included seating guests and releasing servers to go home. I learned how to deal with unhappy guests even if it wasn't my mistake. Management was heavily involved and approachable. My co-workers we manageable and easy to get along with. The hardest part was dealing with unhappy guests & deciding who to send home. I enjoyed greeting the guest and seeing co-workers
good,"Train all aspects of the restaurant front of the house and back of the house"
good,"This job is what you know it to be. The menu is just a step above fast food so sometimes you get some terrible people walking in. People who wouldn't leave a tip if Buddah, Jesus, Moses, Mohammad and the Pope had made the sandwich and delivered it themselves (in the case of atheists please imagine your sandwich on baquette served by Sartre). I mean some really scummy people. Unfortunately, these are also the people you rely on to help feed your family, so prepare to fill a keg of sodas and spin a bin of chips each night. Volume is the only way to make a living in this line of work"
good,"chilis is a fun place to work.. sometimes its very tiring but its worth it, "
good,I learned that no matter what you always keep your cool when you are dealing with a rude customer and never ever argue with them.
good,"I enjoy working at Chilies but I am also looking to experience more in my life else where in the world. It was a very fast passed job, I worked over five hours a day with no breaks. My co-workers were cooperative. When we had a lot of parties come in it felt like everyone was in a rush when I took the extra breath and focused on what I had to do."
good,"Most enjoyable part of day would be ""rush hour"". With multiple tickets/ pages on screen of orders. Having the ability to focus on multiple orders at once and having fun while doing it."
good,"Normal morning shift:(I have found that this is the quickest and easiest way to do the morning set-up) put batteries in all 70 of the Ziosks, get rags and put one in each bucket, two go to the bartender, and one to yourself,get roster from manager, you may have to do some light hunting to find him/her. Sorted and wiped down all menus (not required, but I did it because they are the dirties thing in a restaurant and I have to handle them all day, and sometimes the inserts get lost), then grab the roster and put everyone down on your sheet, I usually grabbed a tea and sat at a booth and did this. then give the front of the restaurant a once over and make sure everything is clean and wiped done, restocked, and all that jazz. Somethings you have to keep and eye on: Which servers are there, and which servers are in which section and how much they can handle, it affects the flow, and flow is 100% your job. also keep an eye on the kitchen when things get busy, you don't want people sitting for a long time after they order, its better to let them sit and wait till there's more tables cleared than overwhelm anybody, even when the customers yell in your face and make extremely rude remarks. If you don't manage the flow, let me be the first to say that everything that goes wrong in that 10-15 minute time frame is all going to get blamed on you. That being said, its still a pretty easy and fun job. I definitely learned hoe to hold my tongue, and how to estimate how mush a server can handle, and how to deal with certain personalities. My co-workers (when not mad because they think I did"
good,I worked here while I was obtaining my nursing degree.  The skills I learned here really gave me a head start as I began nursing.
good,"Overall it was a good job.  They were very flexible with my schedule while I was in school.  However, mainly due to the location of the restaurant, business was often slow.  Being a server with an income based mainly on tips, this was the major downfall of Chilis."
good,Scheduled and managed all ages of employs from a variety of backgrounds in day to day operations. Ensured company cultureand training protocols were met. Enjoyed the contests and opportunity to recognize team members for their successes.
good,"I love everyone I work with. It a very happy environment. As a host you have to run the front door and keep open communication with everyone. The most enjoyable part of the job is interaction with people. All the regulars are very nice. The hardest part of the job is being the only host on when they get busy. You have to run the board, seat, get open counts, be a bus boy, and make sure the servers greet their tables."
good,"*interacting to the guest,make them satisfied."
good,Chili's is a very fun environment I love interacting with guests and helping my fellow team members when they need me. Management really values their employees. It is a hard job being on your feet all day running around but it makes it worth it in the end. What I enjoy most is taking care of my guests and seeing them leave having had a great experience.
good,Common duties of a waitress. Weekend availability. Managers are great to work for. It is an independent as well as a dependent job. Stressful situations are common in this work setting. Have to make sure you're on top of things for when the restaurant gets busy.
good,"I worked there for 11 years. They worked with my schedule the best they could to fit my families needs. Managers are fair, patient, and professional."
good,"Its a great place to work at, for my age.I am getting older and im looking for security. I want to get experince in the business world"
good,Brinker values people.  We all work as a team for the same goal.  I enjoy creating great food and experience for our guests.
good,"It was nice working there, good environment. Management was amicable and dependent. Co-workers were alright, but the occasional gossip (as most work places have) can be a bit juvenile. Otherwise, I'd work there again."
good,"Taking work seriously but not ourselves.Being humble, had patience and perseverance in all things committing and be strong. Be professional at all times. Respect each others and love each other. When you received complaints is a big challenge and the transportation  sometimes the bus left. Have fun to the customers and co-workers when there's someone celebrating any kind of occasions."
good,Fun atmosphere with co workers hard work long hours very fast paste but learned a lot in the process gained a lot of experienced..
good,"Very productive place to work. I enjoyed going in and being able to help my guests every day. Management was easy to get along with and very flexible when it came to scheduling. A typical day at work I would go in clean my area in which I worked in, and made sure I had everything stocked and ready to go for when business got heavy. I would take phone orders and orders for guests that walked in, I would gather together orders and process payments for the orders. I always learned something new at Chili's whether it was about a guest or something new on the menu, never a dull moment when it cam to the education department. Management was very easy to get along with especially when you do your job and didn't just stand around. Hardest thing about the job was sometimes communicating back to the kitchen what you needed and ion the time you needed it. The thing I enjoyed about working at Chili's was the guest experience, to make sure that my guests were happy above all else."
good,Greeting people and bringing them to their table. Answering the phones when needed or cleaning off tables. Run trays as needed when customers are busy and stay up to date on product knowledge.
good,"A typical lunch day shift may look hectic to an outsider taking a peek into the kitchen area, but to everyone on that Chili's team, we are well tuned engine. Since I have had this job, I learned that everyone must work as a team in order to provide the best possible service to our guests. The hardest part of this job is picking up everyone's slack that they may have not completed that would fall in into their standard operating procedures. This would in turn set me back on preparing my workstation in order to be ready for my shift. Management in this establishment is well put together, they provide necessary help when needed in order to complete ones task. I believe the most enjoyable part of this job is being to work as a team in order to provide quality food and service to our guest but also still have a enjoyable time at work."
good,"aprendi lo que es tener un excelente liderazgo. cada dia era distinto al otro, mut divertido el ambiente fascinante."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Chilis. It is very corporate, but still has a base in it's roots."
good,"I really enjoyed working for chilis it was fast paced, fun, and friendly environment. I quickly moved my way up to head trainer. However due to some personal issue in my life at the time I had to quiet."
good,"I made tons of friends during my time with Chilis and got to talk to new people every shift. You also have regulars who come in alot. If you dont like working weekend nights, you might want to seek employment else where, because weekend nights are the big money nights."
good,worked the hardest I could to provide the guests the best experience possible.
good,"A typical day at work consists of making sure the restaurant is always clean, making sure guests are always happy and making sure food always goes out to the guests perfectly."
good,fun place to work. can do pretty well money wise if you are a go getter
good,"While working at Chili's I've learned to be a better team player to help the crew win as a team, I learned how to multi-task under a lot of pressure. The hardest part of my job? there weren't any hard parts because I would do my job just right and if I had trouble my team members would have had my back in helping me. The most enjoyable part of my job was to see the happy faces on the group of families that would enjoy our services."
good,This company was great to work for. They truly care about the well being of their employees. The upper management staff is very knowledgeable and the training procedures are very thourough.
good,"Typical day included greeting guests, taking orders, running and busing hot plates all while ensuring time-management and presence."
good,"Set up and stock for the night when you first arrive, Once customers come in it's time to rock and roll. My co-workers were amazing their was a lot of teamwork, we all had pride in our jobs."
good,"Is always fun people is nice and help each other. good food. love my schedule but if you want weekends of or holidays, good look. your going to live there."
good,"Friendly work environment, my co-workers and management all worked together really well to provide a favorable dining experience. Being able to interact with people everyday was very enjoyable. I often found myself bored with my position's lack of responsibilities."
good,Probably one of the easiest restaurants to pick up and work at.  Menu and training very simple and easy to follow.
good,"Cooking, prepping, stocking, and cleaning. This job was very exciting I enjoyed going to work each day. Learning new recipes, and working with others make for good employment. Co-worker were fun and easy to get along with."
good,Its a hard job because they continually add new thing to the menu but the people there make the job somewhat easier
good,"Upon entering Chili's, at the beginning of your shift, you clock in, check in with the host to see what section you are in, and then you check the side work sheet to see what you are responsible for that night. Then you wait... until you get your first table. Sometimes it may only be a second, but more often then not, you could wait thirty minutes to an hour until your first table arrives. Which is very stressful because while you wait you are not making any money."
good,Impressive business model and culture. Compensation is more than appropriate comparative to other companies within the industry.
good,"This a great place to make friends. Everyone can be friendly, but at work sometimes when you get busy you might get frustrated. Its ok because you see them later and everything is better. The managers are friendly, but can be difficult. If you are there to work then you will be fine, but if you mess around and cost people money then you will have problems."
good,"Enjoyed the menu and environment, lots of tv all over the restaurants not just in the traditional bar area."
good,"This was a temporary job for me to have while I atttended nursing school. The environment is good. The management is a pleasure to work for. This is a waitressing job, and the customers might not always be the most pleasent but I always had a great experience in customer service and always found a way to please the guest."
good,"every day is a challenge in my work in chillis restaurant in middle east,,,"
good,"My typical day at work started out with helping management, makin sure that all of my co-workers are in a positive mood, the hardest part of the day was probably the long hours on a double shift, and the best part of the day was whenever i would get home ."
good,"Chili's stresses ""team service"" and was a new experience for me as far as working with a partner.  Any evenings I worked, I was one of two closers and was responsible for checking out closing side work of all servers.  Also provided continued training and support to less experienced servers/hostesses/QA.   I moved up quickly in this company from server to bartender.  I also briefly acted as training co-captain for a brief period of time and received additional training for that.  Many of managers were phenomenal.  Some staffing problems made working here a challenge at times.  Too many with too little work ethic.  Overall, Chili's did provide me with a lot of formal training and improved my ability to increase my incremental sales and overall profits."
good,"* always taking overtime in our work"
good,"great place to work, just needed more hours. co workers are great"
good,"This was a good job for money on the side, but certainly not enough to completely depend on as the most you could really get was 3 days a week of work. But since we had 3 bussers including myself we would normally only get 1 or 2 days a week. The pay wasn't really that great because we would get paid about $2.00 an hour, and a split of the servers' tips. This only bothered me because my tips depended on someone else's service. Because of this, my pay always varied. But the job was pretty easy. It was your typical bussing job clearing tables, cleaning tables, putting tables together for big parties, etc. Sometimes you would assist the servers by getting their drink orders or put legs down for the trays full of food, answer the telephone, and sweep whenever necessary. There was a lot of room for advancement in the job. One of the bussers who was there before me ended up a line cook and the other one a waiter. I put my 2 weeks in for a summer job that had a better pay with more hours but I definitely would have stayed if it wasn't so close to summer to become a waiter. You also get a 50% off discount on their food."
good,"The staff and managers were very nice and helpful, training was short and easy, and pay was okay. That job help me learn how to deal with certain situations like angry customers. I didn't really have any complaints about being a host."
good,I had good days nice staff fast past work and good hours. I loved working there because i love working with customers. The hardest part when we have a serious rush it get real busy but it also was the best part because when its busy time goes by fast
good,Good people. Easy job. Family friendly environment. Decent wages.
good,Great atmosphere-- a lot of regular guests that I got to know and enjoy
good,A typical day's work would be to meet and greet the customers and make sure they enjoyed their visit. Co-workers were nice. Management had it's good and bad side with me. Some of the managers didn't really care about any personal issues or if there was an emergency and you couldnt show up to work. And they would have a bad attitude. Which was not very fun to work with. 
good,My best time as a server was here. I love the people and the energy that they bring. Even management brought a little energy to the table. Busy restaurant equals great tips.
good,"At Chili's you learn how to multi-task, you have many customers demanding your attention at the same time. You also have to be great with customer service. People will try to push your buttons. So it is a great job to learn how to handle customers and work with others to provide the best service possible. "
good,"looking for different type of work, away from food prep and not having to work lat, Chili's is good place to work and I like to."
good,"A great company to work for. Considerate of your needs, my father had cancer the company moved me to the town within 60 days."
good,"Buenas instalaciones, trabajo en equipo, el mejor ambiente para trabajar bajo precion."
good,Here is a restaurant that is truly cares about its employees at least at my location. The managers do everything they can to get the employees the hours and shifts they need. They are willing to work with the employees as long as the employees work for them. This is a place that encourages and rewards hard work. A typical day ended with me asking to stay longer or learning a new position. The only reason I left was because I moved and finances just weren't there. If there had been more foot traffic and I lived closer I would never have left.
good,"Management was fantastic, always showing great communication skills, and was well put together. the co-workers are wonderful"
good,"I absolutely adored working at Chili's. Of course, this was back in 2007. The work place was always fast-paced, I got great tips for a To-Go Hostess/Cashiers and the people there were amazing to work with."
good,"A typical day at work generally includes making the guest feel welcome, resolving any issues that arise, process payments, ensure workflow efficiency, and performing daily side work duties. I've learned that the guest is always right, teamwork, multitasking, organization, and how to handle any complaints. The management and co-workers are all wonderful. They provide a great environment for work and are always available when needed. The hardest part of the job was learning how to manage a large section of tables, but it has become fairly easy with more experience. The most enjoyable part of the job is the friendly work environment."
good,"Most enjoyable part of the job was the co workers. I have never worked with such fun people. Management on the other hand, they were way to personal."
good,"Co-workers were awesome, made a lot of friends after just moving to Florida from Ohio. Was also my first time serving and I became really good at it. Job was easy and fun, gets a little stressful though when the kitchen can't handle the rush. Miss it a little bit."
good,"I do not like working at a corporate restaurant since there are so many rules that I found a bit ridiculous, but had to be followed. I liked how the scheduling was all done online, but I did not like how I never had a set schedule. It made it hard to make personal plans for future dates. It was a nice place to work, but I can say I wouldn't go back. If I do ever work at a restaurant again it will be family owned, not corporate."
good,Greta place with a fast pace enviroment. They also are flexible with your work schedule.
good,"Chilis Dyer is a great place to work, the pay wasn't much, however IT WAS A GREAT EXPERIENCE!!"
good,This was a internship for a business that was a alumni of oklahoma state university.
good,"I worked for chilis for 3 years, it was a fun experience, but needed a change of place, too much of the same stuff everyday there."
good,VERY VERY BUSY NIGHTS. The management is great. Schedules are flexible due to online scheduling. You get to drop unwanted shifts and pickup shifts when desired.
good,Workng at Chili's was one of the best jobs i have had. Brinker is a lagre Company with tools for learning.
good,Chili's is a good place to work if you willing to work hard and wanting to make money and just like to help people because it gives you a sense of accomplishment.
good,"Working for Chili's has taught me to be a responsible and respectful leader. I have learned the value of labor costs and food costs. I also learned the value of customer service and how important it is to make sure that they are our priority. I moved up quickly working for Chili's and work recommed that any who is looking to see what it is like to be a part of a successful business, then Chil's would be your first stop."
good,Nice job. I like working here somethings are a bit different this location is nice area clean over all a decent place. Put an app in you won't be disappointed
good,"You have to be able to work with others and help your team out. No such thing as, “It’s not my job.” You’ll make great money and will be able to move up if you put in the work."
good,I loved working here just too far from where I live. I would love to work at a one closer. I would recommend people to apply here not only as a dishwasher but also as a cook or server host.
good,It provided a challenging environment to work in and many experiences too. We had managers who helped us to thrive in every shift we had and developed many new skills because of this motivation.
good,"Un ambiente muy agradable, aprendizaje y crecimiento laboral."
good,"It was a good work experience not a bad job to earn a little extra cash for expenses, worked with my schedule, flexible hours and decent pay. Good experience."
good,Even though  cooking is a passion...It is more  of a pleasure to see a smile on someone  face  after  eating  a dish  that  was  prepared by you..at Chilis  you  constantly  have  that  ability  as well as the  opportunities  to  grow and develop  by learning  every  station  mastering  everything  the company  has to offer..also it is  very  beneficial  culturally. Me myself  started  as a fry cook  but not only  was  giving  the  opportunities  to  learn  the  grill  but also  the opportunity  to learn  garnishes  and other things  from  scratch  so as you can see Chilis  is a very  great foundation  to grow  with  so what are you  waiting on...take  advantage!!
good,The people were nice. There's a lot of TVs all around the restaurant for all the sports fans to watch sports. I learned how to prepare all the food in the back.
good,I've learned many things and new recipes. I've Learned to better manage my time and cook multiple items at one time. I'm very skilled at maintaining a clean work place even while a rush is present.
good,"Hi welcome to chilis how many for today? To greet , welcome and talk to your guest or costumers makes them feel welcomed and assured that your workplace will give them More of a reason to go back"
good,"Very nice environment and friendly place to work. Everybody works together to get the job done right. Easy going, and outgoing a picture lace u can call home away from home kinda place. Great supervisors and Co workers."
good,this job is very good for students who need work experience. I enjoyed working here. loved the food. the workers was friendly and loving. the job help me save up money to start taking care of my self.
good,"There will be good days and bad days, but the management team at Pryor Chili's in 2019 truly want to see their team members succeed in the company and in life. They care about the guests and community. They work to give employees the schedule they need."
good,Servers are immature and bully young workers. It was a stressful environment because of the servers. Managers really do work hard and they always were there to help you but are overwhelmed
good,Muy buena Empresas dedicada 100% a la satisfacción del cliente.
good,Made huge impact in my restaurant experience from the front of the house to the back room f the house. I was there for the opening of the restaurant. Great people to work with and great management.
good,"Could help with several store areas when: before opening, others are busy and need help, after hours. Work alone or with others to clean and prepare for customers."
good,Like working there everyone like family NVR had any problems they willing to work with u on your schedule and any personal problems you may have 💯 💯
good,"Calm environment, yet steady movement. Loving atmosphere, the customers are the best part of the job. Enjoying the company of your coworkers making the job run smoother and time seem to be a breeze."
good,Chili’s is a great company to work for because they allow such a flexible work hours and even allow you to work at different restaurants. You get to meet hundreds of new people and talk to almost all of them. The employees at Chili’s try to keep a restaurant-family mindset
good,when i first started working here i loved it great people with great customers as time went by it got slow so i would only keep this a part time job just to get extra coins being a server if you get hourly then this is a good job to have
good,I have worked 4 different Chili's. Is whole it's a good place to work. They offer benefits for full time and part time. That also have a family find to help their employees during times of hardship or loss of s family member
good,Chili's was my first servicing job and i worked there for 12 years. It was a great experience and i enjoyed working there. Very nice place to work if you like serving.
good,I did not feel appreciated for what I did. I was asking to do different task outside my position applied for. Did not have enough people so had to pick up the slack with it a good pay.
good,I was a server at chili's the work enviorment was great. Everyone was friendly and always lent a helping hand when needed.  I would recommend this more for a first time job.  Sometimes its busy and sometimes it's not.  The busier the better and more tables you get.  I enjoyed working here very much the managers were always very understanding and great with equal opportunity
good,"A typical day at Chilis consisted of seeing new faces, getting orders together, taking over the phone orders & accepted cash payments. Weekends at chilis could get a little hectic but i’ve always got the job done."
good,As soon as arriving at work for second shift you get swamped with orders so you have to come in ready to take on the orders or to keep the dishes running through the dishwasher to keep the business going.
good,Great job good hospitality enjoy working for this company great environment good team work fun place to work good quality service great success good opportunity
good,Check tables. Inform manager you're on the clock. I've learned to multitask jobs. Management is good. fat paced restaurant especially on weekends. Hardest part was to get the good shifts. The best part were my co workers.
good,"It can be hectic some days, other days it can be slow. Always need to be prepared on your side of the kitchen and need to be able to get along with your coworkers no matter their attitudes or yours."
good,It was a great job but the employees that they let to work there was bad for the business and the employees that were good for the store were treated like they were not ment to be there or over worked
good,"Great place to work if you are looking for a good work/life balance. You can adjust  your scheduled when needed, request off way in advance, and managers are easy to get along with."
good,"When I worked here I had originally opened this one and it was great for a little bit and then as time when on you realized nobody above you knew what they were doing, but they are your boss after all so you followed the rules."
good,I enjoyed this company. It taught me a lot about people and how to communicate effectively. I learned how to coach and develop others with the training tools provided by the company
good,"Learned all food handler procedures and how to cook all foods from the menu.Workplace was at times stressful but with cooperation and leadership skills i was taught to move through it. Hardest part was when employees wouldn't show up to work, making the work load more challenging."
good,"Fast placed job.great people, the pay is fair and raises are given according to your work performance.they do provide insurance when you get hire dd's on and benefits get better when you are hired on full time"
good,"Working here was a rush, Loved the fast paced environment. The people were wonderful and helpful. If i ever had questions someone had an answer. One thing i appreciated was the managers were always on the floor."
good,"It's a restaurant, so when it's busy, it can get hectic. It's important to keep your cool, even in the face of rude or difficult customers. "
good,Chili's is a good place for a college student to work at and make extra money. Management is not terrible and will work with you on your school schedule and any emergencies that may happen.
good,Chili's is a great job for a teen starting out in the workforce. The employees are super friendly and the managers do their best to fulfill your needs
good,Good place to eat professional people  and hard workers  I would like back because I know the kitchen and people who I work before with. And we use to work good together
good,"the best part of the job is your coworkers, hosting is the worst job, but getting moved up is easy as long as you have a flexible schedule. They work you long hours, but you'll never exceed 8 unless you're a server. The managers will get mad at you if you call in sick, and they love you if you pick up shifts and work a lot. I worked for 8 months before I got promoted because of my busy schedule, but as long as you're available to work, getting promoted will happen."
good,Best place to come unwind after a longs day of work or school . Great service. Food is always made fresh. An the hostess always makes sure your having a good time and enjoying you evening.
good,"Quick paced, easy to learn. I had a good environment; but I'm sure not every restaurant is the same. Light-hearted and fun; enjoyable to work at for sure,"
good,It was not hard coming back. They actually told an employer to get in contact with me so that I could come back. I was working two jobs at the moment. So I told them that I would get back once I decide what I wanted to do.
good,"Nothing out of the ordinary, pretty well to maintaine job. Really good management. Understandable work environment. Easily acceptance of accommodations and accomplishments."
good,"La cultura laboral me gustó, se preocupan por la atención del cliente y por sus necesidades."
good,I enjoyed working a Chili's  . It was fun and the people I worked with there were good team players. The food is amazing.  The management does a great job.
good,This being my 1st restaurant to work at I was intimidated at 1st. I started off in ToGo and made my way towards management. I didn't want to go any higher than a Key holder. That was too much for me. I made good money. Met alot of people and had plenty of regulars. The only reason I left was because I moved out of town.I learned alot about sanitation and customer service here. The worst thing was breaking down the chip machine at the end of the night and some rude customers. lol.
good,"I've worked for Chilis since 2016, obviously i have stayed around for a reason. Comfortable , high energy environment. I've learned everything i know about restaurants at Chilis."
good,Getting better at any work place is rewarding and to accomplish all things involved in a roll fit for success is even better. I love to give great customer service aswell that like a cherry on top
good,"great place to work at, managers are willing to help work something out so that you can work there. Very friendly employees and overall just a nice workplace."
good,"Working at Chili's was it supposed to be a temporary job a second job to my other job, it was fast pace very commercial great atmosphere super busy and most of all that a great staff we worked hard, really didn't lead high levels skill level to work there great pay"
good,Good job to work with good pay and nice people i learned how to cook at a restaurant the managers were fare and helped us out when we needed itthe hardest part was the rushes come in
good,They are good company to work for. They show compassion if you have a problem within you family. They are about working with you and caring for your well being.
good,Fast pace job . Very friendly staff. Job was to do all the dishes and prep and put sticker dates on items. Bi weekly pay was the only downfall about the job
good,"Chili's has a great environment and with the founder driving words such as "" nothing is sacred except the guest's return"" letting us know the importance of guest satisfaction, as long as we follow this it is hard to go wrong."
good,Chili’s is a great place to start off as a host and build your way up through To-Go a good runner then a server. You will enjoy working there and would recommend it
good,"I was a hostess at Chilis, and while I loved the people and most of the guests, I found the job to be a bit boring. Its a lot of just standing around, with the occasional wiping of a table."
good,"All in all this place was pretty fun to work at. Food was good, co workers got along for the most part and managers were understanding.  I don’t have any complaints about this company and would return to work here again."
good,"Every location I’ve worked in they treat all their employees as if they were family. Very upbeat type environment. Very caring and devoted managers, & coworkers. Truly enjoyed working for this company"
good,"Give us your opinion about a typical work day, what you learned, management, workplace culture, the hardest part of your job, the most enjoyable. Do not"
good,"Buena empresa salario accesible buenas propinas semanales, capacitaciones constantes uniformes, prestaciones, comida, buen compañerismo, trabajas bajo presión fines de semana y días festivos pero se remuneran con tus propinas"
good,Was a excellent company to work as grill operator was pleased about the way they cared about their employees with their health care benefits structured around the needs of their emploees
good,When i was there i loved it. The staff was GREAT!!! I was older then most of them but they didnt treat me like i was. Management was awesome they would do whatever they could for you.
good,God work place..nice pace work friendly.people friendly .good salary..discount.. Hood hours...they are flexible with employees that have trouble with car pool are on thrre transportation to work..so ovetrall there understanding
good,I have been here for about a year now and I have liked everything at chilis. I have worked almost every single position at chilis other then being a bartender.
good,Working at chili's for over 3 years was by far worth it. I met a lot of great people and made a lot of good memories. That place used to feel like another part of home but after I left a lot of things changed.
good,"Though the people working at the restaurant are mostly all great, the customers are what really get to you. There are some customers that get upset with the closest employee in their vicinity, even though that employee had nothing to do with the problem"
good,The experience I gained at chili's was valuable to my working ethic. I enjoyed sitting families in their tables and greeting every guest with a smile and a friendly demeanor.
good,"was a very fun place to work, however with management changes came a lot of drawbacks that made i a very stressful and chaotic environment to work in. was sad to leave after years with the company."
good,The day went pretty smooth and there were a lot of team effort to get things done. I learned to do many things that expanded my skills and also the way I work with people around me.
good,"ambiente agradable, todos somos jovenes y estudiamos en un instituto o universidad."
good,Good management and good team work but hours are bad maybe twenty in two weeks .worked here for six months and it seems like everyone is leaving and I think it’s the lack o hours
good,"Needs new management, customer started not coming in to eat. Bad servers with horrible attitudes and being lazy during their shifts. The good workers don’t get the credit they deserve"
good,"Buena cultura, excelente escuela de servicio, trabajo en equipo, etc."
good,"Really fun place to work. Always busy, most of the time it’s easy in and out. Don’t get sucked into drama and try not to take managers to seriously. Good job to get on your feet or if you have limited availability."
good,"Buena empresa. Buen sueldo, pero horarios muy extendidos."
good,Chili's is an okay place to work. This somewhere you don't want to be for a long period of time unless you have to be. The best part about working for Chili's are the people that I work with.
good,Manage 7-10 tables at a time.  Memorizing  orders and answering menu questions.  Anticipated costumer needs and provide exceptional customer service.  Responsibility communicated customer food allergies and dietary needs.
good,This was my first job as a server and it gave me a great chance to develop face to face customer service skills which are needed in almost any job you apply for these days
good,Was a great place to work until a General Manager I was under retired due to the stress level of the company demanding more since they were owned by investors.
good,I worked for Chili's for 13 years and I lovd it.  When I started there it was the best there was in casual dinning.  They had great plans for growth.  the pay and benefits were amazing.  After 2008 things began to change when the economy went down.  By the time I left in 2015 the staffing levels had cut so low that you didn't have a fair chance of succeeding.
good,"It is a fun place to work and the culture is driven hard, because they show they care from top down...it makes a difference.  The only one thing that could be better would be to add bussers back to increase pace of service."
good,"Es un trabajo donde se aprende mucho tanto en lo personal como en  lo laboral."
good,"Busy nights: graduation season, Mother's/Father's day, summer. Super fast-paced and nobody to really keep track of your breaks. I once worked a 10 hour shift on Mother's Day because it was very busy, no breaks. I'm sure I could've asked but we had poor management at the time, I was getting yelled at left and right if I stood still for two seconds, our food was coming out too slow and we were 26 pages behind on orders, so it was discouraged to even think about a break. Now they have way better management, ran by an entirely new crew. Everything runs smoothly even on busy nights. The restaurant vibe will always depend on management."
good,the pay is depending on your experience. the menu is big and diverse so it can get hectic on the line at times but as long as the line works together on a consistent basis execution can be flawless
good,Very busy and face paced fun workers not good pay little hours servers were kinda mean management was okay very stressful no guaranteed hours.........
good,Inglewood inglewood lol I love the city love the people I worked there for 2 years moved up from a server to a bartender and the a manager. It was a great experience and I learned a lot and am forever greatful to the time I worked there.
good,"I enjoyed my time working  there. Great place to work, very fast paced and management was awesome!! They gave me the hits I needed and was very understanding to my current situation ."
good,It was just a temporary job for me. I helped here and there as Togo and expo. But management was always accommodating when they could be. It's a great starter job as a new server
good,Long hours as a manager. Learned the value of leadership as you have a team in the front and back of the house staffing. Food is really tasty and as a manger you get to eat a free meal each shift.
good,Very understanding of school schedule and very accommodating with needs to study and unexpected class work.  Management is outstanding and corporate is extremely organized.
good,"No teamwork,learn that there is no typ of management so needed to work harder,clean place,hardest part was to take the food out quick n hot,guest happy"
good,"I enjoyed working at chilis, the culture and the work were fun.  The management was professional and nice and seemed to genuinely care about their employees."
good,Chili’s is a great place to work if you enjoy to work in a fast paced environment. It definitely keeps you on your toes and everyone is nice and very friendly and easy going so it makes the job very fun
good,"its a nice place to eat but the way they clean silverware was not acceptable, they used wet naps to clean instead of running the silverware correctly.."
good,When i worked at Chilis Bar and Grill I was a host and then became a server. I really liked working at chilis because the job is fun and proactive and the coworkers are very helpful and knowledgeable.
good,"I’ve served/bar tended at chili’s for almost 5 years now. Although it can be challenging at times, it’s a fairly busy location so the money is worth it. We’ve seen a lot of managers come through and some more challenging than others but current management has been worth it. You have to have tough skin to deal with some customers, but nothing crazy. Coworkers are all great! You tip out only the bar tenders, which is a fair amount."
good,"I loved working at chili’s. Most of the managers were respectful and helpful for employees, some were not. Tips and tip out were available at the end of shift. They expected the bartender to juggle 4 job codes at once: to, well, Bartop, and tables."
good,It can be a fun place to work. Sometimes managers need to communicate better but over all its a great environment to work in. cutomers are great too. fun experience.
good,"family style culture, and good corporate policy's.  Staff is always ready and willing to serve up hot and fast delicious food with a smile that starts when you walk in the door."
good,Really good money to be made I averaged about 28 bucks an hour with tips and all.. I loved the staff the management.. How organized it all was.. We always took classes and had meetings to stay updated on chillis new stuff all the time
good,"I was just a kid when I worked there, but my co workers and mananger were very friendly. I always got good hours, pay was decent and they always made sure I ate, especially on a 10 or 12 hr shift day"
good,"it is a good place, especially if you do not have kids. it offers a lot of extra hours in busy days. Chili's tries to make a regular schedule to each employer."
good,Just very busy and fast paced. Most people think of it as semi-fine dining with a discounted price. They want 100% service for half the cost. As long as you can turn and burn with a smile on their face it's a great place to work.
good,I enjoy working and dining there. I would like to work more hours and hope to someday.  I like all of the people I work with and they are helpful to me.
good,"Corporate restaurant gig. I worked as a hostess here, not a server or bartender. It was right next to a very popular mall so it was busy almost every day. The Holidays were especially hectic. I think Chili's really prepared me to work at places that are extremely busy."
good,"Had a great experience and learned from my previous company, having a strong team with respect help the team to grow. The most enjoyable part of my job is gaining respect from each other."
good,"For being in high school it was a decent job. Everyone was friendly and got along. The managers where super nice and understanding as well. I hated having to leave when I left for college, so I would recommend this job."
good,"Working at Chili's Grill and Bar was and has been the most beneficial to me and my skills. I have learned along the way that the managers, servers, and cooks are all a big family. We all had each others backs and had a great time working together. A typical day would consist of greeting guests and making sure they had a table. As each shift went along, making sure guests are happy are the number one priority and so going by the tables and talking to them and connecting with them is a joy. There were bad days and probably the hardest parts of working here is when guests would get angry and also when the environment goes from slow paced to fast paced in an instant. But overall, I would recommend this workplace."
good,good company hours were fair scheduling was fair as far as rotating or working the shift you want . very upbeat environment and fun most of the time .
good,"Fast paced restaurant serving great food with a upbeat atmosphere"
good,"Days could still be long but were enjoyable for the most part"
good,great training programs and technology that helps with efficiency. sometimes the people get lost a little in that hustle. overall they try to make sure to avoid that.
good,"Nothing was hard and I made lots of friends with the guests, most managers were decent. I got as much time off as I needed if requested 2 weeks in advance,  worked with school schedule"
good,"High pace, relaxed and fun atmosphere, great benefits, fun family and friends outings, decent work/life balance, great MIT program and great traing for hours employees"
good,"Fun place to work, you can make money here but it can also be hit or miss.  Great staff and fun environment.  Friday and Saturday nights are the most lucrative."
good,"At Chili's Grill & Bar, fresh is happening now! Find a local restaurant to enjoy our latest fresh mex creations, world famous Baby Back Ribs, and sirloin steaks."
good,"Wonderful co workers, fast paced, making sure each customer has the best dinning experience. Handling money each shift and tipping out at the end of the night."
good,Working at Chili's was a good opportunity for me to try something different and the managers there they were all great and all the employees there they were all so nice and we'll dressed
good,They are a great company to work for. They are understanding and very flexible with hours. Everyone is nice and treats you like family. Plus the guests are mostly amazing people.
good,There was no prep team cooks all performed prep and stocking to their shift stations. I learned how to make fajitas and use a impinge oven for them. I learned how to make salads in a artistic form to have great presentation. The hardest part of that job is that there are a lot of hot trays in the impinge oven its a high likely chance of getting burned. The people the food and my learning experience has to the best part of always working their.
good,"Chili's has been really good to me over the last 7 years that I have worked there. The hours are flexible, the money is good and easy, and the experience that I get as a waitress/bartender is good."
good,"it was professional and fun, great managers. the uniforms were casual. made good money, small town. fun staff it was family, second home. I miss it and I think any one who worked there would say the same."
good,"Chili’s was a great place to work. I worked on the strip so every day was different so it really wasn’t the same everyday grind that is in any other job,"
good,Chili's Bar & Grill give my first job experience.no worked for them for 3 years and I meant alot people that means a lot to me. Since then i worked many other restaurants with the kills I leared from Chili's.
good,"Clock in and start your job. cleaning and prepping work area. regular day in day out. great management and workers made it run smoothly. great food, discount, and all around environment."
good,"I has learn so much from my experience at this place cooking putting the order away and organizing and helping others."
good,Chilis closed down with little notice I am very happy at Applebees now. Great stepping stone to where I am now. Trained fellow crew members and learned about leading by example.
good,Love the job just need more money to move on with life but starting job this is a lovely community to be apart of they are very understanding and honest
good,"Everyday is a day full of team work. Working here keeps you on your toes to exceed guests expectations. As a Chili's Grill and Bar associate, I had the opportunity to move in many different positions and build relationships with just about any and everyone. When you explore different positions, you increase your experience and find new happiness that you never new existed which also helps build who you are and desire to be."
good,"a typical day at work is moving fast, cleaning tables, running food, and making the guest's needs are met perfectly to their liking. Helping management control busy situations."
good,"I loved working for Chili's! It could be stressful at times, but was worth it when it came to getting tips! I would say it is definitely a lot easier when you are younger!"
good,Chili’s was my first job. I learned so much from working there. It was stressful a lot of the time but I enjoyed meeting some people. I would work there again once I’m old enough to bartend.
good,Manage you’re area have to prep essential items that were needed for you’re area will need to be very faced paced need to help others to make sure the environment went smoother
good,"Buen amnbiente laboral , desarrollo personal dentro de la empresa."
good,The management promoted me from server all the way up to General manager within 2 years.  I had a great career with this company and felt they helped me build my career
good,"The team really helps you feel included and needed. Everyone, with a smile, helps each other complete task and increase efficiency in order to rotate guests in order to increase the number of tables each server receives. The kitchen is organized."
good,"Serving for chilis was ok. You just have to be mentally prepared for the fast past, long hours and moving back an forth. be very confident and sense of memory"
good,"Chili's was an enjoyable place of employment. Their was always music playing and sports on the big tvs. It was almost always busy. I really enjoyed meeting new people and seeing new faces. The hardest part of the job was having a table with six or more guests. also getting to the alcoholic beverages from the bartender before they started to melt. The most enjoyable part was clowning around to the music once we were closed and the restaurant was vacant. also, the discounts on the great food."
good,This place has lots of opportunity to move up and look forward to something new there were some nice and some not so nice people that worked here but it was still a nice or ok place to work
good,"I enjoyed my time working with the different types of people, so many characters and things to get me money! The managers were pretty connected with the employees both in personal and work issues."
good,They are very family oriented. It was like walking into a second home. Managers where nice and trained me very well. When I was there I didn't want to leave.
good,I enjoyed working with the employees there.I loved the culture that was present. My pay was manageable and I leaned a whole lot. The only negative was that I didnt have a normal schedule the hours varied but other than that it was great
good,A typical day consist of fast pace interactions with costumers.I learned to be patient with many people and to interact more. The hardest part of the job is to keep on track or schedule. You have to make sure you accommodate everyone in a timely fashion.
good,They take care of their employees I believe in their core values. Most GM try to uphold their values but not all. They will work with team members and understand life happens
good,It’s a very fast pace environment but very fun. Talking to customers and making them laugh was the highlight of my night. It was a very fun and fast pace job.
good,"I 've learned a lot from my managers and coworkers over the years, and our guests are nice. Sometimes money can be great and sometimes it's a hit or miss."
good,"anywhere you work, the people make it what is it. Chili's environment and management interaction with employees was awesome. definitely one of my favorite places to have worked at."
good,worked there loved It had to move when my kids dad passed away but would try there again if i ever was close enoff to one its a good place to bring your family for a celabration
good,"Heart of the house is more of my specialty work simple things. Get in, and get it done by the end of your shift, nothing too difficult the right amount"
good,I was working for Chili's as a student in High School. It helped me develop experience in how work goes and flows. It was relaxed and for the most part I had a good time. Worked there for 3 years until I finally wanted to get out of it to pursue the military.
good,"I loved this job. I was a server, hostess, bartender, QA, TOGO person, and a key hourly. I worked with some great people. The managers I had were awesome. They would help you any way they possibly could."
good,This has been the first company that I worked for that I feel taken care of. They truly believe in advancing their employees. I have been apart of seeing how they work with their employees to shape them for a future career. My managers have sat down with me and other employees to talk and figure out their individual goals in order to help push those goals into existence.
good,Working at chilis was a great learning experience because I had to learn to work harder and faster as the restaurant got busier and busier as the week progressed.
good,"CHilis has many employees, they can do a better job at training their staff. full time employees do receive good benefits. This is a good company to work for."
good,This was your average hosting job. It was easy to get a good amount of hours and the manager I had while working there was very kind and understanding.

good,"really enjoyed working in chilis, learned a lot from my coworkers on new way to improving my service skills. learned a lot and the whole staff was wonderful."
good,Enjoyed working as a team. Fun work environment. Customer service is on point. Laid back and friendly place. I would recommend it to anyone to get a job here.
good,"Task for each role were very specific"
good,Team work everyone seem to work together to help each other out . I really enjoy the years I worked at chili's I feel like I gain a family in the process including the owners they are very down to earth people
good,hard work pays off. you don't always get the best customers but its how you treat them and how you react or don't react to a negative situation. turn over with customers is quick so taking care of 150 people in a shift is regular.
good,Productive and busy workplace geared towards customer service.  Hardest part of the job was the hours and best part of the job were the people I got to work with.
good,Interesting place to learn how to handle difficult time crunching agendas. Gives the ability to handle difficult situations with people and how to diffuse these situations.
good,I typically enjoyed my time at work. Customers were as hard to deal with as the Cooks were but I generally had an enjoyable time coming to work everyday.
good,This review is for the first incarnation of Chili's in Alaska. Business is no longer in operation and I do not have any feedback regarding the new franchise partners in Alaska.
good,"There was never nothing to do. Cooks were always busy and we never really have time to relax and talk. only when we hit our slow peak, but then we would get stocked and ready for the next rush/shift."
good,"Chili's as a company is wonderful. I'm pretty sure as with any job a management team has a lot to do with how each individual location is ran. People don't quit jobs, they quit managers."
good,"un buen lugar para empezar a trabajar, con beneficios de ley, pero con horarios terribles."
good,- family friendly
good,A very high volume and fast-pace kitten.   The hardest  part of the job was keeping customers patient and satisfied. But overall definitely a great environment
good,The management is relaxed but has fair expectations. It is a fun place to work if you do what is expected of you and show respect to your guests and fellow coworkers.
good,The workplace culture as chili's we all worked as a team. Two servers would be placed in a section and they would have a partner they would work with in their section. The side work would be done as a team. Managers are extremely helpful with anything you need. Was a great environment to work in
good,i enjoyed working there i had a child in wasnt able to close every night around 1 oclock . if i had tthe choce to go back i would . they also have a new manerger
good,Family based work place. Great teamwork and everyone helps one another out. The company has great ethnics such as St Judes fund raiser and contributions.
good,"As a host, I would maintain guests experience and track wait times for those incoming. By correctly quoting times according to tables almost available, I was able to succeed in guest satisfaction for a dining experience."
good,Es el mejor empleo que nadie a tenido en cuenta y si es mi me gusta mucho ese empleo
good,"This was a good company to work for. I learned a lot here and also had a lot of fun. This was a great first server job, very fast paced and the money was good."
good,The dish washing job wasn't hard at all to do along with the other tasks involved. The employees i worked with were very helpfull if you got into a bind
good,It was a great company to work for. Learned a lot of what to do as well as what not to do. Many perks for GM's as far as conferences and travel. Compensation was very good.
good,It’s a great atmosphere to work in and great people to work around. The starting pay is pretty good and you do get raises every 6 months. The management team are very well trained and they do take the time to train you properly.
good,"Chili's was a stage in my life I am grateful for. I learned a lot about what it means to be a part of a team all striving for one common goal. I learned to be a leader as well as how to follow instructions from management, which in turn taught me how to best accomplish tasks as a unit as well as on my own. I consider myself a social person so the interacting with people aspect of the job (serving guests) was never an issue, in fact I enjoyed it very much. The most difficult, but very necessary part of the job I'd say was breaking old habits to develop new, better ones."
good,Pues es una buena empresa cuenta con horarios flexibles y muy buen ambiente de trabajo !!!
good,"I would prep the food in the morning with other people there. I would also cook or fry the food that was provided. I would work 12 hours sometimes including closing but, I kind of liked it because I could kind of do whatever I wanted as long as the work was done."
good,I've worked for Chili's for just under a decade and my overall experience with them is awesome! I highly recommend working for them because of the team and family driven culture that they have developed.
good,Fun and great culture with multiple driven and exciting co-workers. I would advise anyone who wants to get started in the restaurant business to apply to a chili's near you.
good,As a former management team member we were very engaged with our staff and worked constantly to make each employee reach their maximum potential. Worked shoulder to shoulder daily to develop the trust between our team.
good,This was my first job after high school. I was part time as I was going to college as well. The environment was very team oriented. Everything else was normal.
good,fast paced and energetic workplace.  can be very stressful at times but overall a great family environment with excellent managers and competitive wages for certain employees
good,Pleasant environment to work in. Great managers who are always on the floor helping where needed. Typically everyone gets along and a lot of employees develop friendships outside of work.
good,Great place to work.  I enjoyed the work environment. Very fast paced. I only left due to school obligations. But the management team work cohesively and I would recommend this job for anyone.
good,This was a good place to work. The staff was very nice. I just wasn't able make enough money as a busser. I would suggest someone to work there. The manager was pleasant to work for.
good,"I really enjoyed my experience working for this company. Management was amazing and they worked with you and were very flexible about scheduling. I don't care for serving as a job in general, but this particular restaurant made it more bearable and it was a fun, fast-paced environment."
good,chilis was a nice place to work and also were the managers. we had good hours to work and we all made pretty good money. there were also nice regulars who came in.
good,Good place to work exelent team work maneger Are exelent always worries for there team members. I defineteli recomend chilis to work if you got de apportunity you will have the experience off live time
good,"i worked for chilis for 15 years, it was a good job as i was young and expanding my family. good management staff and easy to work with on scheduling and requests for time off"
good,"The team is really more like a family which makes the whole job easy to work at.  The menu has gotten significantly smaller, which makes the ordering process go very quickly and the food runners help to make the dining experience go smoothly. Great Location!"
good,"Loved the team that I worked for."
good,"Chili's was fun to work at with the exception of one manager.  Flexible schedules, fun coworkers, advancement opportunities,  food discounts.  Great food. Use of Hot Schedules for all your scheduling needs. Upper management listened to your concerns."
good,"This place was great to eat at and work their. The environment was awesome. Flexible hours, great for a college student or mother. Food was always delicious and always got great service."
good,Fast paced work environment with lots of advancement opportunities. Great benefits and bonus potential. Very employee focused and guest experience driven.
good,"Great place to work, great atmosphere, customers ok unless you worked in the bar where they were outstanding, Management is pretty good, however, not flexible with scheduling."
good,I worked at chilis for a couple months as a waiter. It was a fast paced work environment but was a great part time job. The pay was good too which was an added bonus
good,"Loved Chili's. Great management, coworkers worked well together, had a 50% discount, and the atmosphere was amazing. Job pays well especially if you work for a lengthy period of time and I would definitely recommend."
good,"Chili's Texas Bar and Grill before it closed was my second home, the staff there was my second family. Everyone use to get along with each other and it made for a smooth sailing workplace. I loved working here, I have no complaints about management, or co-workers or the food. I honestly miss the food. If Chili's Texas Bar ad Grill (street side locations) were still opened I currently would still be working for this company."
good,"The passionate environment all begins with the managers. They seem very interested in their employees and their values. These managers not only care about their work ethic, but also their lifestyle and values."
good,"I started from the bottom up. I bussed, hosted, served, bartended and managed. I learned the ins and outs of how casual dining restaurant is run. My GM was an awesome mentor. I was eager to take on more responsibly as I advanced and my GM was willing to let me take on more responsibilities. I believe this is truly the proper way to learn how a restaurant is run. The best mangers start from the ground up. It can be fast paced and stressful at times; maintaining composure is key. I really enjoyed my daily, weekly and monthly assignments and responsibilities. I enjoy getting things done!"
good,Well managed and smooth running.  Everyone works together and the managers are always around when its busy.  I had to work a lot of doubles due to a lack of employees.
good,It is an easy job. This is a first job for me and the management did a very good job at helping me get adapted to the workplace. This job is a lot of standing and walking and you must be a people person.
good,been there for about 7 years going to the bitter sweet to leave sense i have gotten to know everyone very well. Everyone works as a team and takes care of each other when times get hard.
good,Great atmosphere to work in but can be very stressful at times given the industry. Opportunity for advancement is there but only after having worked for the company for a very significant amount of time (ie 10+ years). Managers work with employees for flexible scheduling which is great! The company also provides a great healthcare benefits package!
good,"I met a lot of nice people working at Chilies. It can be a very fast paced work environment if your not used to waitressing, but the faster the pace the more money you are making."
good,It was a good place to work I had a good crew to work with me and the management was good to they are not going to be on no BS they are going to keep it straight forward with you
good,"Chilis was my first job. I started when I was 15, almost 16. I started as a hostess, and ended as a busser. This was my first customer service job, where I learned to greet people with a smile."
good,I loved working here at chilis. Unfortunately it wasn't the right time in my life and age. I would love the opportunity to return. The food is great the managers are awesome and the staff is fun to work with. Anybody could be successful working with chilis.
good,I love my job in chili's there so many things I learn to this company specially during  the operation. How to engage in every guest and all the procedure. Regarding in product and sale even in culture and beliefs of other person.
good,"Working as a server / hosts at chilis was a big experience for me at age sixteen. I feel like I learned so much in a short amount of time . I learned to communicate better with my team members and customers as well.  Having patience is a major key in a working environment , this determines how well you are able to handle a situation in where a customer is mad , or feeling a different emotion.  The hardest part when I started working at chilis was taking 6 tables at the same time . It takes many practice but one you get the hang of it , its more easier . The most enjoyable part of chilis was when we would have team meetings . We all sat in a big table and talked about what should we all do better as a team to help our customers have a great experience while dining at chilis ."
good,I was the prep cook at Chilis. I arrived at 8 am every morning and made sure the cooks had what was needed throughout the day. I loved the people I worked with and he environment.
good,"Aprendi las variedades de servicios que brinda, aprendi a socializar mas y a tratar a los clientes."
good,The hardest part of the job is being on your feet all day.  Working here is great.  Co-workers and management are awesome!  Getting to talk to different people and building client relationships is the best part.
good,a nice up beat place to work at. Good food good discounts. I really liked working there as a teenager it was a fun environment and I would still go there to eat.
good,it is a fun chill place to work but that is not enough to live your life as an adult. they do not give you the hours they say they will give. even part time people get less than whatwas agreed upon
good,It was a fast paste job with room to grow to different roles at it. It was always changing from day to day which made it fun! I was able to work almost every position besides cook and dishwasher.
good,Great place to work. I have built many life long friendships here and have learned many valuable life lessons. I have learned to be proficient in time management as well as prioritizing. The hardest part of working at chilis is that it is a temporary job that is mostly filled with young adults and at times hard to have everyone on the same page.
good,Not a classy restaurant but also not a whole in the wall. The tips varied from day to day like any other restaurant. If you're a waitress it's not any different from the typical serving job
good,I would clock in and work non-stop until lunch then go back to a continuous fast paced workflow. The workflow relaxed as the restaurant came to a close and the entire workforce would work together to clean and prepare for the next day.
good,"Fast paced environment.  With the right team was able to properly care for guests.  Turn over rate extremely high, but check average low.  Difficult for advancement."
good,"very small town feel when it comes to both the employees and the customers everyone knows each other and it feels like family."
good,"Chili's is a fun workplace that thrives in keeping your guest happy. There's a lot of work that goes into being a server there, and you have to be a failrly good muti tasker and have good organization skills."
good,"By far Chili's is one of the best restaurants I've worked for. The management team is awesome, if you do your job and work with them they definitely return the favor."
good,Its a good place to work i enjoyed my time there. The people are all good at what they do. The hardest part of the job would be closing dishes. The most enjoyable part of the job would be just the people i worked with.
good,I had a great time in this business from the environment and the strive to become better in everyone. The free food and the openness of the facility is my favorite.
good,I had a really good experience working there. The upper management was very nice. The continued training and information given to help you to do a great job was awesome. I worked for multiple locations and the culture was consistent across the board.
good,"Not the best company to work for but a good one none the less,they were one of the few companies that pay for time off during the irma disaster so that let me know that value their employees to some extent"
good,My normal day of work was pretty relaxed helped out with cleaning tables off. I enjoyed the costumers because I was the first person they saw when they came in and my goal was to put a smile on their face.
good,This was a fun placed to work. Managers did a good job on running shifts and made it run smoothly. The hardest part was to handle the regular guests. Overall a good place.
good,"Individualistic and Team Work. If you're a good server, you will make money. Everybody loves Chili's and their will always be traffic. It's up to you how well you do."
good,Empresa en constante crecimiento lo que genera desarrollo para su gente
good,"I would come in to work clock in say hello to everyone start my day in a positive attitude to set off a good vibe  wit coworkers."
good,"My schedule always changed. I learned how to be a server and working under pressure. The people were amazing. The hardest thing was to deal with fatigue. What I liked the most was my co workers, they made the work funny."
good,"Love Chili's! Working for Chili's is really like no place else. Great leadership,.team memebers, training program, and tools to manage business effectively."
good,The overall culture is good.  I learned a lot and got a chance to be creative at times.  Management was great.  There is differently room for grow if this is the direction you want to go.
good,"Help each other when they behind cook time then I help them if they need or need quickly make client happy with this food and hot food. "
good,working at chilis is fast paced. ITs a fun atmosphere and it is pretty good money. The other empooyyes seem to lookout for each other and are helpful in time of need.
good,"alot of people to ask questions to, they are willing to answer questions and help point you in a direction. pleanty of resources to guide you to different places"
good,"Atención al cliente, server, dish, conocimiento en la barra"
good,"Greet customers, offer appropriate seating arrangements, present menus and take orders, ensure the quantity of menus is sufficient to cater to the number of guests. • Set up dining rooms & make reservation arrangements. • Manage & maintain both exterior and interior of the restaurant clean; and organize tables and work area."
good,Worked for this location when they opened. Some lulls in certain employees motivation to complete tasks properly but overall quite the learning experience.
good,"enjoyed my time there. the menu changes a lot though so guests that were regulars frequently complained about that. Overall a good place to work, friendly people and great benefits."
good,I really get along with all my co workers its very good work environment. great food very awesome managers just all around nice place to work and have a nice meal.
good,"The amount of money you make is equal to the effort you put in."
good,Very enjoyable experience. Awesome atmosphere. Good people and great opportunity to build working relationships. Great opportunity to build public relations skills
good,"It was typical waitress job, fast paced, dirty, management was fine, usual retail job, long hours, easy to move up, split tips at our location personally"
good,"love waitressing at chilis, environment is great, but i do have to say the scheduling manager does pick favorites which is of course not fair. But over all I enjoy working here as a waitress, my schedule is well managed with school and other commitments that I personally have."
good,Great place for a starter job. if you are looking to get your feet wet and learn how the resturant business works. It also is a great way to make easy fast cash.
good,It is a pretty standard serving job with a more laid back and team oriented environment. The staff I worked with was very helpful and wanted everyone to succeed. Including the managers that had no problem going out of their way in order to make sure their employees were set up to succeed.
good,I loved working the back of the house. I learned lots of new things the crew was great on nights. We had fun and still got our work done. The managers were awesome and helped if needed it
good,"Un buen equipo de trabajo, oportunidad para seguir estudiando, disponibilidad de horario"
good,"It was a good place to learn and thrive in the restaurant industry. I met a lot of good people, made great rapports with many of the regular customers and I was rewarded with substantial amounts of money."
good,"Developing communication skills to be informed with all members to create a team environment to achieve in common goal,to present quality food and great customer service."
good,"I had a good experience in my time at Chili's.  The health benefits could have been improved or more easily attainable.  I enjoyed the quick pace of the restaurant and it is in a great location offering ample opportunity to greet and serve many guests and turn profit.  The team members I worked with were for the most part attentive, helpful, and motivated.  Management was kind and fair although communication could improve.  The culture and atmosphere overall was fun and enjoyable."
good,"Chilis is an awesome place to work. It's fast paced and alot to take in at first but once you get in your groove, it can be a lot of fun! We laugh alot and have fun ,but we also take our positions seriously! Team work makes the dream work! Hardest part was learning the entire menu and all the ingredients. Love how everyone looks out for each other like a family!"
good,they are very busy but like to cut everyone hours and never want to fix the grease trap and it is a very dirty place to work and management only cares about the cooks and servers
good,Fast pace during the busy hours.  Made good friends.  I learned how to cook safely.  Management was great.  Everyone had fun.  Hardest thing about the job was working in the kitchen in the heat.  Best thing about the job was the environment.
good,"its alright , no big challenges , part time job full time , its all good , chill ... slow sometimes . some shady people come to eat , other people are just boring"
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo, buen personal ,lo inconformidad es q es una pequeña tienda donde casi no hay afluencia de gente lo cual repercute en mi economia"
good,"Chili's is a great place to work, where you can make fast money. However, it isn't what you consider fine dining, so you may not always walk out with the best tips. You need to be able to multitask and really interact with guests to make their experience a great one."
good,es algo cansado y estresante si eres de cocina pero igual puedes ir creciendo rápidamente
good,A good work place to grow up your carrier and be successful. You well learn all about the standards from back of the house food preparations to front of the house service.
good,If you work hard you will make great money if you slack off well you make close to nothing. Many lazy servers but you do not have to be one of them! Hard work pays off
good,I love working for Chilis. Brinker is an amazing company to work for and I would highly recommend Them to anyone in the market for a job in the restaurant business.
good,I was a hostess at the chili's in Jacksonville NC. This place could be a mad house sometimes because of all the people but we always seem to pull through.
good,Working a Chili's was never a dull day. Everyday was a chance to make money and get to take it home immediately. Serving is a constant chance to make as many people happy as you can at once all the while making as much money as u can. As a line cook the money and hours were very consistent. Cleaning the kitchen from top to bottom each night could make the hours change.
good,"I really enjoyed going into work at 10am and setting up and getting everything ready, In the first half hour of opening I was the only server and would be able to focus on the tables right away. I learned a lot about budgeting money and being able to focus on one thing at a time, including how to count money back. The work place was always busy. I was always on my feet gathering and serving my tables food and drink orders or being a team member and helping my co workers out by doing the same thing. i have always enjoyed being busy."
good,My job is to take guest orders bus their tables while they are eating make sure that I have refills was the table after they are done overall I miss you and that the guest had the best possible experience while dining at the restaurant.  When I was working the shift of expediter I made sure that every plate that went out of the kitchen was presentable and delicious
good,"Ensure employees follow menus and food handling procedures"
good,"A typical day was fast paced and busy"
good,"I was a server, trainer and safety coordinator.  I enjoyed working with the public and the staff.  Chilis is a great company to work for."
good,"Company was great, had lots of fun working with new people and new management. Learned a lot about alcoholic/non alcoholic beverages. Shifts usually last 9-10 a day from 4PM-1AM. My job got easier by the day because of the new things I learned about it. Loved my job, got to meet new people such as customers or employees. Would definitely recommend this company to a friend."
good,"Willing to work around my schedule, seeing as I was a stay at home mom this was very important to me.  They were incredibly friendly and welcoming when I went in for orientation. I would recommend them as an employer for practically anyone."
good,Overall a good job but managers can have a difficult time ordering enough supplies making it hard to please your customers when were out of multiple items.
good,"I enjoyed talking to the guests and learning their names and likes. id take tables and train new hires. as a bartender I had a cash drawer, and took inventory daily. I moved up quickly. from server to trainer and bartender within months. I had to leave, I had a job opportunity in the oilfield. all in all, it was a great place to work."
good,"great workplace, although sometimes unorganized. would've still been working there but I am seeking a different type of work environment, something more professional."
good,Great team members. Everyone made me feel apart of the team upon arrival. This was a great part time job while i was in school. This was just something i did to make money while pursing my dreams.
good,"its good money but i need an internship desperately, my internship for class is meant to start by july 4 so as long as that can happen i will be able to graduate this august"
good,"Enjoy working in the environment with different culture of people. Have to be able to handle stressful situation when it is busy during lunch time or the holidays."
good,"I worked at Princeton chili's bar and grill for a while and I loved it, I didn't want to lose that job, but they over hired too many people and could only give me 14 hours a week so I lost my apartment and had to move."
good,"Hardest part of the job was when I simply did not know nor did anyone else on solving a problem for a patron."
good,Work there since I was 19 and its been great. Would recommend Chilis to just about anyone looking for a job from a server to host to manager.  Great company to work for
good,Wouldn't mind working there again. Positive restaurant chain and good food. Managers had a bit of drama but was overall a good place to work. Had to leave unexpectedly and they were very understable.
good,"the  manages were very supportive at my location. the kitchen staff were also wonderful people, and everyone worked a well as a team and unit at my location"
good,I enjoyed it. Was very long. Free meals every break. Very fast pace. Had to catch on quickly. I was able to cross train a little. Mainly i was a fryer.
good,"me agrado la estancia en la empresa con mis compañeros de trabajo , la estancia fue agradable"
good,preparing a variety food and adheres to product prep. and handling procedures and food plates presentation with diverse method of food preparation time
good,Good job. You work in a fun and fast paced environment. The management is great and the salary isn't bad either. The only down fall to this job is the little amount of hours you may get.
good,I enjoyed working here. I was hired as a hostess and was quickly promoted to lead hostess. When I found out I was pregnant I told my boss who started training me as a waitress as well so that i could have more income coming in .
good,"This is a good place to work to get extra money or while in school. this job taught me a lot of skills, mostly people skills, that i will carry for the rest of my life"
good,I was 16 and wanted to work to have an income during high school. It gave me a chance to build up some cash to help buy a car and support my hobby and sports tickets
good,"More enjoyable with more dishwashers on duty, but it was fast paced and i had to be quick on my toes so to speak. it was easy to fall behind but keeping a steady pace helps tremendously with work production."
good,Great managment staff. Fun place to work. Great food. Benifits day one for all staff members only reason i am leaving is to leave the restaurant industry as a whole
good,fun fast paced environment with lost of multi tasking and working with other associates to satisfy the customer above and beyond. This job helped teach multitasking working well with other teams to be as proficient as possible
good,if you're look for a prep career you should start here in my opinion. This place will help learn the ropes and all the basics about prep not only that it will some experience and how things work in the kitchen.
good,This was a great place to work. You can make money while meeting new people everyday as well as working with a team of outstanding women and men. The management team not only took an interest in you at work but also in your personal life as well.
good,"A productive workplace culture, which allows you to create a personal connection with the guests. It allows you to create the best possible experience for all guests."
good,Almost everyone there is really nice and the managers are super understanding it really is a family environment. The best part about working as a hostess is seeing customers leave with a smile on their face. The hardest part of the job is fighting off boredom. There are days when it would get really slow and I had nothing to do. Sometimes your shift gets cut way before you would like. Once my shift got cut after two hours.
good,Good place to work. Fast paced. Health care benefits.  Do not take this job if you're not ready to give up long nights and a couple hours of sleep because it will mentally beat you. This is a serious business with a large quantity of customers that need to be serviced as soon as possible on a daily basis.
good,Working with guests you have to know how to talk with your tables and how to approach each one.  Small non verbal ques help to know what the customer is needing.  Managers are helpful and will assist as needed.  The reward of seeing the guest come in for a meal and leave smiling and knowing they will come back is the best feeling.  The downside is sometimes schedules are based on the table payment machines and that may not describe how the visit was the best.  When only a 5 counts it is hard to get customers to say that without prompting.  They should look at the regulars that come in and how each table is treated.
good,"As a Food Server and Hostess in Chilis my typical work is to serve the guest, greet and providing customer service. Thus, I  learned a lot in customer care services and work in a fast paced environment. The management is good. The workplace incorporate with different casualties. Perhaps, the hardest part of the job is to reach the desired sales per day, handling guest complain and sometimes long hours at work without excluding payment."
good,Would go back if I had the desire to work back in the cooking field again. The only problem was they would over hire and the hrs would not be so good but besides that it's awesome.
good,It was absolutely fun working here. Workers are very helpful when needed. Gives you a chance to grow in the food industry. If you enjoy being around great people this is the place for you.
good,Chili's was amazing. Staff were welcoming friendly and helpful when help was needed. overall great experience! definitely recommend to someone looking for a fun inviting place to work.
good,"Being a hostess in my previous company my job is to welcoming all the guest, greet them with a warm smile, talk to them in a good way and respect them. I dont have any problem in my previous company, what i want is a career growth, where i can share my skills and knowledge. I learned how to be more strong, i have more patience and if theres a problem in the company all you need to do is to support your team, your management in order for them to think individually. The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with the kids, helping to others even its not my job."
good,"very fast place, great hours friendly people always doing something everybody works as a team managers where all great people and always willing to have your back"
good,"Something very new to me I really enjoyed working with them, great management and employesss, everybody always made sure they did there job. Great time"
good,I enjoy working at chilis because my coworkers are very helpful and kind. They make my job easier because they do what they have to do when they have to do it. The managers are very nice and mange the restaurant well. I enjoy the fact that I can request time off and almost always receive it.
good,"A typical day at work would normally be very busy, but I'm able to handle most situations. Management isn't the best, but it's decent. Hardest part of the job would be having to multitask 3 or 4 stations by yourself. Most enjoyable part would be making food and befriending awesome people."
good,bueno no es mucho tiempo pero me pareció muy interesante el ambiente.
good,"Job was very good at informing staff of new changes, protocol as well as optimal efficientcy rules of thumb. Great teamwork."
good,Great place to start in the industry. Fast pace and great training. Would highly recommend if you are looking to start in the industry
good,Depending on the managment this can be a great work place. The staff also plays in a big part. Having a well put together team can make the shift run smoothly. Always enjoyed working with my co-workers and considered them family
good,Very fast pace busy atmosphere in the kitchen. A lot of cleaning and washing. Management is good but need more workers to get the job done in order to get off on time.
good,"Work was tough sometimes but they people were fun. Hardest part was some of the dinner rushes would get really busy. I enjoyed the people. mangers would help you out if they could, but were really demanding due to customer needs"
good,"Being a host at Chili's required plenty of observation and a hundred percent focus. The environment was healthy, not always beneficial but very much a learning experience. The managers were helpful, and handled situations professionally at all times. My co-workers were the difficult part, as a host, you have to decide whether or not to sit a party and where you want to sit them. Servers will get upset with you for double seating them and it's a very frustrating job, but I loved it."
good,"In a typical day I had to receive the costumers and sit them at the tables, I also had to assist the waiters and bussers of the restaurant, I learned to manage time, work under pressure and to handle difficult situations, which I liked the most were my coworkers and the cultural variety in the restaurant."
good,Great bosses and met a lot of good people while working here. Hardest part about the job was the customer. The most enjoyable part was finishing up the day.
good,"managed good employees also had a great area director."
good,Chili's was fun fast-paced but a casual dining experience everybody I work with always made the job a lot easier and more enjoyable I would totally recommend somebody working for chili's
good,"Enjoyed my experience there over my 20+ years and to relationships along the way. Deal with going from franchise to corporate was a challenge, but overall great."
good,They have a great establishment for their employees with a fun work environment. They have a caring group of people that care about you. I would prefer this job to anyone because they are a professional work company.
good,Working at Chillis was always full of lots of energy and surrounded with people who worked well as a team. Managers were always there to help out when you needed them. I really enjoyed taking care of the customers.
good,"I work hard at my job . "
good,The maamagement is sometimes under stress because of the customers being difficult but most of the times its easy going and everyone's willing to help.
good,"Working here for my first job I learned the ins and outs of restaurants, and that not many people can handle working there."
good,"Chilis is an all around great place to work. You always walk out with money, and work with some great people. Nothing is too hard, but is a challenge at times. Management is good, always treat the employees with respect."
good,"Relatively stress free environment, as far as restaurants go. Great co-workers and decent management. Look forward to going to work. Good, short shifts."
good,Chili's works hard to create a positive and productive culture.  At the restaurant level the people you work with are like family.
good,"busy during eid."
good,"During my experience at Chili's I felt like it was a very good business and everything was well explained. However, working on busy days can get tough and can be a lot of work for one person. Especially if you're closing by yourself. Luckily, I never had the chance to but i did get to reorganize and tidy up the loading dock which was pretty fun. DO NOT take this job if you're not ready to give up long nights and a couple hours of sleep because it will mentally beat you. This is a serious business with a large quantity of customers that need to be serviced as soon as possible on a daily basis. The speed of service mainly depends on the dish washers and this is where working slow becomes an issue. If you manage to adapt then you have no worries. Pay is extremely acceptable and brings a smile to your face bi-weekly."
good,"Working in a restaurant is not the easiest. When dealing with someones food, you can see a more difficult side of a person. This job has taught me to have patience with people. Although days can be tough, co-workers are very enjoyable and helpful along with management."
good,"Working for Chili's as a student was a good time overall. I enjoyed most of my coworkers and we were hard working, but knew how to have a good time. The job was laid back which sometime was great, but other times not great. I had a some problems with the Ziosk screens on the tables. They were good for customers in the sense that they could play games and pay their bill without having to wait for their server, but the server review surveys were not the greatest. I personally had good scores, but the customers do not always know how the surveys are used to behind the scenes and would sometime leave bad reviews just for laughs. Your score would suffer unless you were getting 5's and only 5's. I received more complaints about the system from customers than praise for the system. Other than that, my other qualm was the occasional lack of communication between the managers which depended of the cycle of managers at that time. I noticed some managers worked better together than others. The hardest part of the job was definitely being stiffed by customers who either ""don't know how to tip"" or ""don't tip at places like Chili's"". Getting bad tips is just part of the life of a server and I've accepted that. On the other side of things, I enjoyed waiting on hometown friends, and getting to know my coworkers. I have formed some really close friendships with my coworkers and we will occasionally go out and go on trips together. Overall, Chili's was a positive experience and I developed a new found love for serving."
good,I have been a bartender at chili's for two year and it has been a very rewarding experience for me. The most rewarding part of the job is getting to interact with customers.
good,"Just like any other restaraunt you fulfill guests needs at all times of the day, such as taking and delivering food orders, assuring accuracy and satisfying every guest"
good,Wonderful place to work! Fun low stress environment with wonderful people and opportunity to excel. Managers were friendly and willing to help in any way possible.
good,"Co-workers and even management will help you in anything that you need help with, we are one big family. The hardest part of the job will be meeting everyone's needs, even though you will try as hard as you possibly could, there's always that one. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing the customers leave in a happy smile."
good,"every day at work is a fun and fast day. I learned about diferent culture when i served the guest that come to have a great evening and watch Copa america soccer games. We the best menegent , their are very pro-employee. The hardest part of my job is when i have to served costumer that have some ascent  that i dont understand,but i got great communication skills so i manage to give them the service they deserved, the most ejoyable part of my job is when the costumer give a tip for my service"
good,"I enjoyed the work environment at Chili's. The hardest part of the job was the busy moments and everyone's attitudes clashing. I would suggest not applying for this job if you cant handle working under pressure or in a fast paced environment. You must have superb customer service skills to be productive on this job. The only reason I left was so that I could complete my last intense college courses. The money was good, however, some nights were much slower than others."
good,Working as a server with Chili's was a fun experience. I got along with my management team and other employees. The opportunity to grow is great!
good,"I was a hostess here at Chili's in streamwood. I miss working for this company ALOT. The general manager was always very fair to all of us, although the shift managers did chose favorites. My work schedule here was very flexible, although I didn't like getting ""cut"" early, I did enjoy working with the sweet staff at this location."
good,"Full time student with engineering major working on the weekends to support myself, easy money for anyone that don't mind spending most of the day walking"
good,"Its fast paced, fun, never the same from day to day. I've met some really interesting people and have formed some great friendships with guests as well as co-workers. I've learned tolerance and patience when dealing with all walks of life. Put a smile on my face and move on. Being a manager is multifaceted and they have a lot of responsibility to guests, employees and their bosses, its not an easy job. Knowing I've changed someone's day by giving my best to them, being able to help co-workers and don't forget money is what makes the world go round, but its not everything, its relationships."
good,i simply had alot of fun working here. it was very strict as far as following the rules are concerned. the benefits were very protected and well done.
good,"I was the first employee of the company as a Designer. Manager was an Architect who has a very creative ideas and superb knowledge about design and architecture. I learned almost everything from this company and this was like a education institute for me rather than a workplace. I loved working with the creative team who were added later on. and the reason I left was also the 2010 crisis and there were no jobs for the company at that time. "
good,"This was my very first job at age 16 and stayed with this company for almost six years. It was a lot to learn for a first job, but I loved it. I moved around to many areas very quickly to gain experience in multiple levels of customer service."
good,Chilis is a fun and productive work place. The customers are always a pleasure to serve and the staff are also a pleasure to work with.

good,"Come into work on time clock in and get started."
good,Everyone is very welcoming with positive attitudes. There is a lot of team-based work within the table sections. I enjoy working at Chili's.
good,"It is a very hectic environment at times (as expected), but the staff and management are well-trained and prepared to handle such environments. The hardest part of the job is keeping your head on straight when the restaurant is packed and you're trying not to forget all the things you need to do simultaneously. If you can get past that, it is a fun and fulfilling work experience."
good,"- Greeted customers, took them to their seats."
good,"It was enjoyable I had a routine everyday,where I was given a list to prep for my 8-10 hr shift. I also made sure that the restaurant restrooms were clean for the customers, that alone took me six hours. After my janitorial cleaning ,I would go back and help prep/cook for the  remainder of my shift."
good,I worked there for a very short time but was looking to get back into teaching.  I enjoyed management but 70+ hours a week is difficult.
good,Typical day at work was easy and busy. I learned how to work harder and faster here. Management was good and friendly. Co-workers were awesome and good to work with. Hardest part was how busy it got. The most enjoyable part was cooking and conversations with the people there.
good,"The management is great at this site. I love everyone I work with. We work in teams of two and had to learn to rely on each other to get our job done with proficiency. All of my co-workers were great people to work with and I developed some true friendships out of this job. There really wasn't anything that was hard to do at this job, but if I had to pick my least favorite thing to do it would be sweeping the floor after a busy night. When we got very busy, everyone pulled together and helped each other to get the job done. The most enjoyable part of this job was getting to meet new people everyday and the people I worked with. I learned how great it can be to work in a team-centered environment and how rewarding it can be when the team is successful."
good,"Good upbeat, fun atmosphere. Fast paced, and good pay. Great hours, great management and perfect place to grow. Good money for the hours"
good,"Awesome workplace, everyone's very fun and friendly to work with. Managements very nice and very understanding no matter what the problem."
good,"I liked hosting, especially meeting tourist during the summer. I've learned more communication skills and how to work under pressure. The management was nice, as well as the coworkers. The hardest part of the job was working a double shift with short breaks in between. I very much enjoyed the closing shift, there was a lot more to do."
good,i enjoyed my time working at the Chili's establishment. The management and staff were all very friendly and fun to work around. The team service there was awesome!
good,"Showcased leadership abilities by coordinating all cooks in sending high volumes of presentable food out in a timely manner.  Maintained a fully stocked kitchen, food safety conscious line, and friendly atmosphere.  Trained new associates in the proper corporate procedures and safety requirements. Organized table orders and coordinated servers in sending high volumes of food to the customers at corporate presentation standards. Made sure each guest received an exceptional experience and dealt with any problems that arose."
good,Management was wonderful and fair. Showed concern for employees and always kept their word if saying they would do something for you. Coworkers got along real well. Everyone was a hard worker and great team effort and accomplishments made.
good,"its a easy, fast paste fun work environment, with loving and respectable co-workers. customer service is great and you meet alot of new and friendly peolpe"
good,this is my first job here in dubai and im really thankful for this company i learn to much to them and they are all nice and even the management its very nice only the problem here is the salary is low only that one and the enjoyable part is everyone treating as real family
good,"Demands to be on your feet for multiple hours at a time, might have to stay to work double shifts. Great tips, awesome team, and fast paced environment. Management is easy to get along with, and the most enjoyable thing about this job is that you make great money."
good,"Muy buen gerente que me toco, amable y comprensible."
good,I really did meet many friends working this job that I am still in touch with to do this day. Would have kept working for this company forever but I think they went out of business.
good,"The overall experience at Chili's has been enjoyable. The majority of the crew enjoy their time at Chili's but, being short-staffed has caused a great deal of physical stress for many of our workers. Our management have been trying to resolve the issue yet, training time is so brief that the new and less experienced servers coming in are giving out and leaving due to the stress. "
good,Family restaurant putting out lots of good food and drinks and always  motivating staff to upsell with many contest company wide.I always felt highly competitive at Chilis to have the best P&l which really taught me to trouble shoot problems.
good,Great place to start out and figure out what you want to do further in life. A job like serving definitely allows you to be able to experience situations that can prepare you for other jobs requirements down the road.
good,"I loved cooking at Chili's.  We had a great team.  Everyone worked well with each other.  We were a family.  And like most families, we had our fair share of spats.  But that did not last long.  Great place to work."
good,"Chili's has great tools to help you perform your job.  It was great having real time information on your food usage verses theoretical.  On each table they had Ziosks that allowed the guest to give the restaurant detailed feed back.  The scheduling system on Hot Schedules allowed you to fine tune labor down to the minute."
good,"I Work in Chilis both morning and evening shift. I learn a lot of thing in chilis like: Being responsible for food safety and for guest, increasing profit and sales, Being flexible in all aspect in the restaurant and etc. Manager always gives feedback to all workers and they provide all the things what we need in the restaurant to work well and function well. Teaches us how to grow as a good worker."
good,flexible workplace and with helpful staff. great people and atmosphere to be and work around. easy to understand and enjoyed interacting with new people everyday.
good,"During my time with Chili's I learned more than I would have expected when I first started. I was able to advance through three major rolls in the restaurant industry while earning the title of certified trainer in each roll. Chili's embraces team service techniques which helped strengthen my working relationship with co-workers, communication skills, and customer service. For the most part management genuinely cared about personal growth within the company. One manager in particular personally saw to my advancement to bartending leading to valuable leadership skills."
good,"I come in and start preparing the dishes and glasses to put them in the dish washer. Also, always maintain my area clean, and take out any trash to the trash can. At the end of the night, I mop the floor and clean the walls, and everything with hot water and Clorox. Everything has to be clean and ready for tomorrow."
good,"Very fast Paced. Have to be fast on your feet and able to multi task. Have to maintain great relationship with your guest. A typical day is greeting tables taking accurate food and drink orders sometimes very detailed. Make sure food is delivered in a timely manner. Refilling drinks,Pre busing tables, Processing payments."
good,I started as a hostess and worked my way up to waitress. The job taught me how to manage my time and keep things organized at a fast pace. I enjoyed being the face for a company that is all over the nation and can become a blur to customers. The co-workers were a mix of interesting people too.
good,"typical day is sweep, scrub, and mop floor, clear restrooms. prep foods for cook. wash pot,pan, dish, and flatware. taking out trash cans."
good,"Typical day is starting up with cleaning windows, setting up the front desk, and welcoming in all Guests. I learned how to use a POSI machine and how to take food orders. Management was great and my co workers were all friendly and helpful. The hardest part was making sure everyone was taken care of while handling calls, running food, and spot cleaning. I enjoyed everything about that job; it was a lot of fun."
good,A typical work day at Chili's involved greeting and waiting on customers. Making the guests feel welcomed. Multitasking between guests with ease.Taking payment from customers and calculating correct change. I learned a great deal of customer service and problem solving skills. This job enhanced my multitasking skills. It taught me how to work hard in a fast pace setting. The management at Chili's really did a great job helping you perform your best. They were understanding and caring to everyone's needs. The co-workers and Chili's are very team focused. We were all working together to get the tasks at hand done as accurate and fast as possible. The hardest part of this job would have been the physical exhaustion some shifts of running around all day. The most enjoyable part of this job was pleasing customers. I am very customer service orientated so when i customer left happy with the dining experience they received for me I felt accomplished.
good,"all i can say is ""Like no Place Else"""
good,"Excellent company to work for"
good,"fun, busy, food discount, close customer and guest interaction, training, friends, good food, good cooks, good drinks"
good,"Serving and training at Chili's was a great experience. It allows someone to interact with co-workers and guests for an entire work day. As a server with Chili's you have the opportunity to make someones day providing them with a great dining experience. The most difficult part of this job is handling difficult guests that can be rude and nearly impossible to please, but those few people are out weighed by the many wonderful people you get the privilege of interacting with. You can make their day and they can make your day!"
good,"La Empresa es buena solo que hay personas que la hacen ver mal ya que en algunos puestos ponen gente que no responden como la empresa lo requiere, "
good,A typical day at chiles is fun. They make your job exciting and make you feel like u want to come in and do your job. Mangers treat you fair and wants to know how you doing and not make you feel like its only about the job
good,"You can just walk in the door and everyone is asking how you are and starting conversations. The management always want to know what's going on in your work and personal life, getting to know you better. We are always joking around and having a good time, as well as getting our job done."
good,For a restaurant this one had great benefits including paid vacations 401 ks etc etc. Also fun competitions and they never cared that I was a homosexual

good,I enjoyed working for this company. Always had a good time and never worried about money because restaurant was always busy!
good,Great working environment with very coachable staff and management. Majority of co-workers are selfless and intelligent. Management is very approachable and always listens as well as executes! Hardest part of the job was extreme volume of customers/guests but led to an exciting shift everyday.
good,"I real loved working for Chili's. The reason I left was because I got promoted at my other job. The managers are great, and so are most of the people that I worked with. The hours were normal restaurant hours, but nothing over the top. We got to listen to the radio in the kitchen, it was great. Now, when it came downing to working, there was no playing. You got the job done, or there would be problem. Do not run late on food, that was the #1 rule in the kitchen. 'No tickets over 10 minutes, unless it was a well done steak.'"
good,Chilies was probly the 2nd best job i have had since i been back they paid great and i always had 40 hrs a week...there was a few good people but didn like some.
good,the company was a great company to work for and the environment was always fun and exciting and the manager were fair and kept the drama away
good,"Everyday at chillis. i would constantly make food fast and neatly following a recipe. "
good,"The period of time I worked at Chili's, I learned and gained my experience in hosting. I learned how to deal with people and how to handle tough situations and tough customers. I would say staying calm and keeping a great decent attitude would be one of the hardest parts of my job. I enjoyed my job though, I had great co-workers who made shifts super enjoyable. Management overall, has it's good and bad, they do help when needed and always try to be at the top with any given incident."
good,Learning how to work as a team and learning to be able to learn how to provide the best customer service for each family or table.
good,"Opening shift duties; prep of all the fruit, mixes and juices for the shift and correctly labeling with date and time. Making sure that no product was past its expiration date. Customer interaction and drink and food order. Time management between bar clientele and drinks that had to be made for the rest of the restaurant. New employee training. Closing duties; cash register count, check count, making sure that the rest servers completed their closing duties by checking them out. Cash drop for the day and writing summary for the day events."
good,This is a fast pace environment and the co-workers were a lot of fun to work with. The management staff was a big help whenever it was needed. The hardest part of this job was the rushes during dinner when we were spread too thin in the kitchen.
good,Great management and friendly staff. Learned how to multitask well in a difficult environment. Great opportunities for advancement.
good,It was fun working there. Making sure customers were happy with food and drink service. It was always busy and there was never a dull moment. Always new food and drink items to try.
good,This job is very fast paced but it can be fun if you make it! I would suggest not letting rush hour get to you or wear you out and youll be fine! I work there a few years ago and it wasnt too bad (employee and management wise).. not sure how it is now.
good,"If you're good at what you do it's a great place to work, multitasking is a must. Have to be able to run multiple stations simultaneously to get hours, if you can't handle pressure and getting hit hard during peak times for long periods then it's not for you. Job security varies, I opened a chili's and on the schedule it said ""only the strong survive"" , in short if you can't hang they'll cut your hours until you quit. I stopped working there because the commute was too far but enjoyed working there very much,I tried to go back recently to find out much had changed in the kitchen not any good for the cooks. Mostly automated from what I understand, some conveyer system of some kind that has cut the skill level of staff and lowered the pay scale so I did not return because the wages were so much lower."
good,"A regular day at work is quite slow at first, but as soon as 5:30 PM hits, the rush starts. The night starts out hectic, but as soon as you get into the swings of things, your night be a little bit easier. The night will bring happiness usually and that you always have a smile on your face no matter what happens. My co-workers would make the night. All of the people  I worked with were always nice to me and would always help with me. Since they would do that for me, I would do the same right back at them. They would always be fun to joke around with and hang with, but as soon as it got busy, they would get straight to work and be serious. Overall, my work day at Chili's was always a great place to work."
good,"I love working for Brinker. They are very good to the management teams. very fast paced , there is always something going on family nights or fundraising and great customer service"
good,"recuerdo que el apoyo siempre lo tuve,prontas respuestas al invitado y para mi insentivos de parte de la empresa y por parte de mis gerentes siempre el apoyo a mis nececidades laborales y personales,hice buenos amigos y me capacitaron muy bien para otras areas de oportunidad,complacido en el tiempo que labore en cmr"
good,great place to work i was just ready to get out of serving tables. If i were still attending college it would be a great place to work because they are willing to work around you school schedule
good,"Always exciting! Something new everyday, and overall positive experience indeed! I enjoyed my time at this company immensely. Would work there again!"
good,Chili's had a family atmosphere for its employees and clientele. Management worked hard to develop relationships with the regulars and all customers.
good,"Chilis is growing and working toward great things. As a manager you have very little quality of life. Salary is good, but if you break down hours to your pay hourly team members fair out much better. Team members sometimes make their job harder than it needs to be. Managers cook, wash dishes, bartend, wait tables and more, while focusing on guest. Time management for managers can be a challenge due to such focus on labor. When getting team members off the clock leaves management having to pick up slack and can be difficult. Most enjoyable part of the job is guest interaction."
good,its a pretty easy place to work especially as an entry level employee I didn't have too many hang ups I just don't know who id recommend age wise but overall I had a good time.
good,"my time at chilis was a very special time. the people who worked there all became like a family, the enviroment that the team built was second to none. food and service is super easy"
good,My work at Chili's was interesting. I liked it. The co-workers were nice. It is very busy working in the back of the house.
good,I didn't really get to experonce a lot at this restaurant beacause I had to go back to school so only worked there for about a month and a half but they had excellent team in the kitchen and in the front proper dress and everyone got along the best part of doing team work in a work place.
good,"Chili's Bar and Grille was my very first real job. I was hired as a hostess. I enjoyed coming into work because the manager, hostess, and bartender got to wear a headset. That was probably my favorite thing about coming in. We had a comfortable uniform; jeans, a black polo, and slip-resistant shoes. The food is wonderful and I met some pretty cool people. I only worked here for two months because of lack of hours and pay."
good,Chilis have a variety of employees and their scheduling is very workable.
good,Every day was a different day. Some days you can have rude upset customers and you have to try and make them as relaxed as you can. Ask them if they would like a drink. Put yourself in the customers shoes. Try to make them laugh. Other days you meet wonderful people who are delayed and just looking for someone to talk too. It's great to make someones day brighter.
good,"Love chili's but I need a second income."
good,"Hard work in the kitchen, but it was a team effort, and no one let anyone fall behind.  It was a nice atmosphere."
good,"Multitasking is key. Have learned how to talk to people, and work cohesively with peers. Meeting new people is the most enjoyable experience."
good,"golden corral had a fast fun paced environment. nothing was the same every night."
good,"I enjoyed working here while I was in school full time. The managers were very understanding of my school schedule and always made sure they scheduled me accordingly. The environment was very lively and the employees at my store were very friendly. Going to work wasn't a task, rather I looked forward to going. The hardest part of my job was the schedule; I mainly worked nights and weekends, but that is the price you have to pay when you are working through college."
good,"Great place to work and build relations with customers."
good,I learned alot about behind the scenes of what it takes to run a restaurant.
good,"Busy atmosphere with fun staff and management. "
good,"if i was hosting i would seat people and greet the costumers when they arrived and when they would leave, i would also help run food and drinks and clean he bathroom and tables. If i was doing ToGo i would answer the phones take orders use the computer prepare the food and handle money."
good,"I had worked here for a long time, and for the most part, it was a really nice experience. As far as serving goes, it's one of the better places in downtown State College to work."
good,"Atención al cliente, aprendí a trabajar en equipo."
good,Monitored all operations including employee job performance.Planned directed and coordinated all restaurant operations and conditions to ensure quality.Great team work and positive attitudes.Interacting with guest and team members was great.
good,"The company is good as a whole, but there are always problems in every job. I felt like my managers had my interests in mind and they helped when they could. Like with all serving jobs it was just that, waiting tables."
good,I was a line cook. also I prepped every morning good ppl nice envirronment
good,"Clean, busy environment, teamwork, great management team."
good,"very sociable job"
good,I was a bartender through college. Flexible working hours and easy cash.
good,"I am the service manager for a very high volume, high pace restaurant. I stay busy from the moment I hit the door to moment I leave, whether it's writing the prep sheets, checking the line, counting the safe, doing the truck order, accepting orders, checking the restaurant to make sure we are ready by the time the doors open, checking in staff, greeting customers, watching my BRG's hours, cooking or doing dishes I enjoy working with and for people, making their dining experience the best it can be, coaching my staff plus working right along side to lead by example. "
good,"A typical day at Chilis includes making sure everything is stocked for the shift that is about to start, giving the guest the best dining experience, and making sure you keep a clean and neat work environment. The management is wonderful and is always there to help you when needed and the co-workers are amazing. We have a saying team work makes the dream work, which we apply daily. The hardest part of the job would be having to deal with unhappy customers, however, I have learned how to handle most situations and make sure the guest leave happy. The most enjoyable part of the job would be working along side my wonderful co-workers."
good,This is a a busy restaurant especially on weekends like most restaurants. My co-workers and managers are easy to get along with and get the job done.
good,Your day consists of preparing meals for customers and cleaning equipment afterwards. The management are level-headed and fun to work with. The hardest part of the job would be during the evenings on weekends. Closing time was the most enjoyable part of the job. I learned how to more efficiently multi-task.
good,i really enjoyed this job just the new people i met and the wonderful staff.
good,great management. Excellent training. Wonderful employee benefits.
good,Great Place to work for Job Advancement .Very Friendly atmosphere
good,working at chili's is such an amazing experience. you'll will never have a dull moment and the co-workers and mangers are great. I would definitely recommend people to become a chili head.
good,Great working environment. The most enjoyable part of working for chili's  is to see customers come in and enjoy the food we make for them. Also taking care of my customers to the best of my abilities. Great feeling knowing I'm giving an honest effort and people appreciate it.
good,"To start the day. I would deal with money handling by counting out the cash drawers, petty cash and last nights cash drops. Making sure the daily deposits were ready to go to the bank. Print up daily roster and year to date sales reports. Then I would do what we call a walk though were I would go through the restaurant making sure that the front line was set up and the front of the house was ready to open the doors.Then we would start to take care of our customers needs.At this time I would check to make sure that bar tender was set up for success asking them if there was any bottles liquor that needed to be pulled from the liquor cabinet.After all this things were addressed.I would check on the quality of our products.Making sure that it is going out in a timely manner.Addressing any problems that arrived.Then taking it into consideration.If the problem needed to be handled by my self or to delegate to another employee.After everything started to slow down I would get them started on there side work. So I could keep the cost of labor down.Then I would do the server pay out so I could make cash drops.Phone in the daily sales reports.Then I would start on the working on the front of the house schedules for the bartenders,servers and the hostess."
good,Great time great service good when my child was born i was giving a $100 chilis bond in his name
good,"I always loved it because I never got a chance to stand still for a second."
good,its a great company I enjoy the enviroment. Management is invovled when it is slammed or slow
good,Chili's is a great place to work if you have prior experience in fast food. Here I had the chance to work around professional experienced chefs. I learned how to manage a multitude of simple tasks in a fast pace environment. Management was excellent and always willing to work with you to improve working conditions. One free meal per shift for back of house employees was great.
good,Typically a pretty fun place to work. Can be difficult at times dealing with so many different personalities and different peoples temperament. I have learned how to deal with different guest situations some good and some bad. Learning how to work with different people has been a great learning experience. Most of the managers that I have worked with have been amazing. Most of them were hired from with in the company so they understood the job and what it entails which makes it easier to get solutions to problems. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the difficult guest even when they are completely in the wrong. But part of customer service is to make them feel comfortable in any situation and not show them your frustration. The customers should feel at home and they should feel valued. The most enjoyable part of the job is making that connection with a guest that last and last. They are the reason we come to work.
good,"Love the fast pace working.  Love the food and people.  Helping others,"
good,"a very high paced enviroment, great people and great boses."
good,Great company to work for! Managers shouldn't listen to rumors though.
good,Prepared and made meals accordingly to orders. Prepped as well. Cleaned and made sure that area was maintained.
good,"A typical day at work would be helping prepare the kitchen for the day. The rest of the day would consist of greeting, seating, and attending to customers needs. The hardest part of the job was to find the best way to manage my orders so that everyone was satisfied. The best part of the job were the regular customers making my job much more fulfilling."
good,"Throughout the day, you would do one thing: Prep food. From one thing, to the next, you wouldn't stop. So, fun you ask? Yeah, it was.. The bosses would come back and mess with you while you listen to your MP3 played, Walkman, or iPod. Tell you, you messed something up. You get a little nervous and then they say, ""Ahh, I'm just kidding with, you're doing great!"" Best times."
good,"Work at the en kitchen consisting of a fryer, salad, expo and grill."
good,"I have been in the business for over 20 years. It is good money for not a lot of hours, which makes it a great place to work if you are on a tight schedule. Great job for college students in order to work around your school schedule, yet still make enough money to live. "
good,"I found the people working at Chili's to be very welcoming, helpful, and hard working. I enjoyed working for the company. Everyday I would walk into work and know that Help was always there if needed."
good,I was a host so my duties were to seat customers and bus tables. I learned how to work in a very fast pace environment and how to be able to adapt quickly when large parties would come in. The staff there was like family. Everyone was pretty close. The hardest and the most exciting thing about my job was Friday and Saturday nights when we were running around the restaurant cleaning all the tables and trying to get everyone sat in the alloted amount of time. The most enjoyable part was when customers left happy. Being the host I was the last face they saw as they left and it always felt good when they would compliment the service that they received.
good,A typical day at work would be coming in at 7:30 am. Cleaning the outside. Then prepping food and cleaning dishes. I learned that communication is vital to the running of a business. The management at Chili's was great.

good,"Chili's afforded me many opportunities to contribute to not only how my store ran, but often used my ideas in the local district and beyond. I not only learned on the job, but was afforded the opportunity to be part of increasing my knowledge by attending many modules, meetings, reviews and conferences. Helping others keep up with a fast changing environment was always a priority."
good,I worked many stations depending on the day of the.. So each day was different.It was a very high pace job so i would pump out out of food during the dinner. Working at that job i learned to stay focus and motivated. The management was fair and the people was nice.. I got a chance to learn how it feels to be in a very busy place and i enjoyed the challenge..
good,Working at Chili's was great had given me the drive to be competitive. They also give chances for their people to grow in terms of career growth.
good,"great training and career advancement"
good,"Work is totally about taking care of my guests, from prep to organization and motivation. I have gained much valuable experience in guest- related issues and multi-tasking. Management seems to be more detached from the general flow and co-workers are the main source of help and interaction. Working 10 to 12 hours without a break is draining at times but I greatly enjoy meeting new people and having the pleasure of making them happy and satisfied with their visit."
good,man you meet so many good people in the resturant  business and chilli's has a good product and good price on dinners and drinks which keeps you as a worker busy and making good money

The management is very fair on giving hours and scheduling according to your availability. I get along with all of my co-worker and since I have worked there have grown bonds with each of them.
good,"A typical day at work was fun and sometimes a bit unorganized. "
good,Overall Chilis was a great company to work for. I really enjoyed the changes the company made to the menu every couple months. I also loved the fact that I was so involved in the training of the stores in the area to teach them the new rollouts
good,"A shift runs smoothly mostly in part because management is spot on but also because the heart of house and front of house run like well-oiled machines. Teamwork is valued greatly in this restaurant and communication is key in getting what needs to be done in a timely and efficient manner. I was impressed from the day I set foot in this Chili's as a transfer from another store. There's a high standard that makes itself well-known but not impossible to achieve when everyone is on the same page. Fun isn't out of the question either. Good-mannered spirits surround the restaurant and it's a joy to come in and be productive and come out fruitful. The hardest thing for me is to recover from is when I make a mistake and send out food incorrectly. As a To-go specialist, wrong food that is on it's way home is a disaster. Unlike food send out in the restaurant that can be fixed promptly, a to-go guest shouldn't have to drive back to get the food they ordered the first time around. Problems like this results in phone calls that have to be mediated by a manager. These problems rarely happen and I pride myself in accurately getting orders right. It's a let down that I take personally but I always try to make it right with the guest. I try to keep the same fun and high-energy attitude going that I bring to my guests and crew. I enjoy working at Chili's and really appreciate the skills I've attained such as teamwork, communication,  and great customer service. I really enjoy getting to know my guests and feel that it matters every impression I make and the value of getting to know people, not"
good,"Average waiting job; learned a lot about food, people, and customer service. Management was always open to talk to. Co-workers are average. Loved Margarita Madness!"
good,A great atmosphere to be in. Very laid back environment. energetic.
good,Working for chilis has been a pleasure over the last 8 years.  I learned many things about handling guests needs and working efficiently under pressure.  Also gained experience on managing staff while multi tasking.  Became proficient at motivating and and organizing
good,What I enjoy the most is interacting with my guest and my cowokers
good,"The worst day was in my life when my other co - staff are ill and that the busy's day ever in my life."
good,"Working for Chili's was a different experience for me. It showed me that working fast paced is what i enjoy doing. I can handle the pressure and if not, I am not afraid to ask for help."
good,"When I first arrive to a typical shift I sign in and then go to the host stand to see which section I will be working in and who my partner is. Then you just wait for the tables to come in. The manager were all great, they made sure everyone was doing their job and everything was running smoothly. The hardest part of the job is dealing with difficult customers but I would just smile and be calm, cool and collected. The most enjoyable part of the job was putting a smile on peoples' faces and knowing that they enjoyed their experience. I also loved how I was able to show my personality."
good,Learned everything I know about the food industry while working here. 
good,"This is a great place to work while studying at the university nearby. The management understands that you are busy much of the time, and provides a flexible schedule for you. "
good,"I enjoy the team but the work can be hard for the low pay. From what I hear this is the only location where everyone is friendly, so I guess I got lucky."
good,"struggles with work/life balance for everyone, as there is a lot expected and everyone takes personal accountability for their work."
good,I found out the job just wasn't for me. not a bad job for others
good,the servers made my job easier and this was my favorite job yet. it'sbest to work in a place that you love
good,Chili's is great and the people are good hard working honest people and I love them dearly.
good,"i liked it but didnt want to serve, i enjoyed meeting new people."
good,"I liked it, chose to leave and found another job that payed a little more during the recession."
good,the best part I liked about Chili's was that the menu core stayed teh same but we had promos that came out every 3 months. My job was to coach all my staff the new menus also to go to other stores and teach the other managers
good,"My typical day would be meeting new people on a day to day basis, making them feel comfortable enough to actually have a conversation with me. That way I could answer any questions they had and make their dining experience the best it could possibly be. Management was more than just management, if we were extremely busy and the cooks or servers needed help, they would be in the kitchen helping the cooks or out front helping server bring food out. Everyone was treated the same and that meant alot knowing there was no favorites. The hardest part of the job was getting all the food out hot...somethings took longer than others and it's difficult to ensure all the food is out in a timely manner and hot. Everything about my job was enjoyable..if I had to do it over again, I would change a thing."
good,From this job I learned how to master a Margherita. There were details that Chili's trained their employees to maximize the sales for the business and the tips for the bartender that i still carry with me to this day.
good,Great company who cares about their staff. Lots of fun if you're a student and the money is good for a tipped position.
good,*co-workers were enjoyable
good,"good place to work, just had trouble with language barrier. loved when busy i got to work many different cook stations"
good,the whole staff treated u like your part of their family.. very postive place to work.
good,I really enjoyed my time working for this company. The management staff is well trained and will usually listen to suggestions from any employees about ways to streamline the work process.
good,"A typical day at work here would be that i would just eat the guests, and if there was a wait take their name and ask them to have a seat and wait politely until a table comes up. It got frustrating at times, but it was well worth the expierence."
good,Chili's has been a great job for the last 9 years....I recommend it for all college age adults.
good,At Chili's its a lot of work when it comes to cleaning tables and preparing them.
good,"Typical server job. Management is dynomite, and most co-workers are team players!"
good,I learn alot working here the staff was great and I had a great time working here
good,I had a day i had to help the manager it was great.i learned some steps of how to be a manager.the management was great and my co-workers were great.hardest part of my job was nothing i enjoyed it.the most enjoyable part was my team that made my day.
good,"A typical workday for me as a line chef at Chilli's Bar & Grill involves long hours of standing, lifting and quick movements and performing physically demanding tasks."
good,I enjoyed working here the extra money came in handy. I met many people for the most part the staff did get along. And it was at fun working environment. There was opportunity grow with the company but this was a part time job for me.
good,Very demanding job but great benefits. I learned that having a job that is demanding and fun makes for a great exp.
good,"The managers Ive gotten to work with and know are amazing and make a constant conscience effort to make Chilis an all-around great, safe workplace. They genuinely care about staff. I work with the BEST servers in the world!! They are very respectful, pleasant, hardworking individuals and give Chilis that ""family"" feel when I come to work!! The loyal customers we have make working at Chilis such a great experience and I always look forward to seeing them."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job were the numerous company-sponsored contests that introduced some friendly competition into the work environment.
good,"On weekdays its only a regular day at work, its not that much busy not like during the weekends when a group of family or friends are having their lunch or dinner. Management are good to the employees. They provide our own accommodation and transport. We work as a team. The hardest part of the job is when sometimes we are lack of employees, so we need to do extra job. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people."
good,"A typical day included preparing the bar for the day. Taking care of guests and serving their food and beverage needs. I also trained newly hired employees, and wrote schedules for all employees."
good,This was a wonderful opportunity to develop a young adult as a good employee. Encouraging your staff to be versatile and take on many different roles is vital to any staff. The training opportunities and workshops were a great tool at such a young age.
good,"Great experience. Management was helpful at all times when needed. Co-workers help each other, wether it was with question or a task that needed to be finished. Learning here was easy and quick."
good,"Chili's is the first and only job I've had. At first it was great: the restaurant was busy, all of the employees worked hard, and the company as a whole seemed to be doing fine. The hours were extremely flexible and while the pay wasn't extraordinary it was above minimum wage and suited me just fine at 18 years old. Chili's brought me completely out of my shell and I wouldn't be the person I am today without it. I've made some great friendships, gained almost 7 years worth of customer service experience, dabbled in some aspects of management, and learned many life lessons. Over the past few years however, I've noticed a decline in almost everything. Our pay is no longer very competitive, the company is no longer innovative but instead the last to jump on the band wagon, and while management has improved, the hourly employees no longer seem to care about their job or duties. The company has enacted many new rules in order to improve the guest experience and drive our sales back up and all the pressure has fallen onto the hourly employees without any added incentives or benefits other than keeping our mediocre positions. Our benefits have gone up in price and down in value to the point where you may as well not have any for all the good they do. While the management team specific to the restaurant location where I am employed is fantastic and extremely caring and understanding, they can only do so much within the company's restrictions to make our jobs better and make us feel like more than easily replaced peons. I will give the benefit of doubt to the company, however. I understand"
good,Great place to work if you're a person who likes to cook and learn new concepts of cooking.
good,Managment and staff are great. with it being restaurant oriantated not great benifits but fu to work for
good,"This job was quite a lot, I learned a ton about customer service and how a stressful day can be when people don't get their food. I enjoyed building up a team experience with my coworkers. The hardest part of the job was doing way more than what I was required to do and doing other people's jobs at times."
good,They were a great company I enjoyed working with all of the staff it was very clean all the time great atmosphere the customers were amazing Ione of the best jobs I ever had was at chili's bar and grill
good,I really liked playing a role at chili’s but the management was so judgmental and i didnt like that. I used to work hard their but in the end i was satisfying
good,For me the most enjoyable part of the job was the opportunity to work with a team and learn new things it was a very friendly environment I learned a lot about the work force by doing this job
good,"It is a fast pace job, but it is rewarding in the end. I loved my managers. Out of all my jobs that I have had, this one was one of the most fun and the highest paying job I’ve ever heard making an average of 25/hr"
good,"Leaving Chili's was definitely difficult to do, and that says a lot considering i really didnt love my job.  The people here are absolutely phenomenal, including management.  Everybody is in your corner"
good,"I started at Chili’s in 2017 as a server, with no serving experience. A year later i had become a bartender as well as utilizing my former kitchen experience as a cook. Now in 2019 I’m a FOH manager, my GM being the then-shift manager that hired me in 2017. I’ve gained more life experience in that restaurant than anywhere else combined. The people you meet in any restaurant can be life-changing, but Chili’s is truly as the slogan states: like no place else."
good,"I really enjoyed all of my co-workers and managers at Chili's.  In fact many of my friends are from different Chili's in the STL area.  They really put emphasis on getting to know fellow co-workers by holding a softball tournament every year that included all of the stores in the area.  The store in Chesterfield, being a slower store, would cause us to under staff sometimes.  Being under staffed as a bartender meant I would have up to 11 tables plus the bar top and drinks to make for the restaurant.  It is hard to give quality service under such conditions."
good,Chilis is definitely a fast paced environment with a lot of demand every shift however given the right team and managers it is also a very rewarding and fun experience
good,"It was pretty cool working here for the most part, managers were cool as long as you work. Very fast paced can be stressful at times but that's any job. As long as your trained well it shouldn't be to hard."
good,"I really enjoyed working at chili’s bar and grill in Lafayette, La. I learned very quickly once I was hired. I also moved up the career ladder very swiftly. The management and the atmosphere was very enjoyable for me"
good,Come in fold kid menus. Take the iPad and clear/fix the seating. Make sure if any tables were dirty that they were marked on the seating chart. Make sure the rotation is correct for the servers.
good,"I worked for Chili's for five and a half years as I also worked toward earning a bachelor's degree. Chili's management was very accommodating to me concerning my school schedule. The management was among the most down to earth I've ever encountered in my working life. They do an absolutely excellent job. The opportunity to make great money as a server or bartender is enormous, but one must be willing to put forth the effort to do so. The hourly wage is virtually nonexistent ($2.13/hour), and a server/bartender's entire income relies on the tips of guests. "
good,"Fast paced work environment "
good,"I worked as a ToGo person (prepares takeout food) for a couple of months. I LOVED the management, they were able extremely understanding! I knew coming into the job it would be very fast paced, and I thought it would help me get over my very bad anxiety, but I guess I’m just not the person that can get over it and that’s why I had to leave. On Saturday nights there won’t be a second you’re not working, but you’ll get so much money in tips but you have to split with your partner. On mondays they usually only have 1 Togo person so you keep all the tips, sometimes I would get $60 a night. There’s a lot of stuff you have to remember, and working the computer can take some getting used to. In the beginning, it’s inevitable it will be hard, but everyone that works with you will be happy to help. I loved working at chili’s so much, but my doctor eventually made me quit because I stopped going to school so that I would be awake enough to go to work."
good,for the time i worked there it was great it took a little bit of time to get used to how everything worked though compared to when i was at the Marriott but it worked out well in the end
good,"I really enjoyed working for chili's restaurant, good and friendly people and the management was very fair and worked with you with whatever you needed..."
good,When I was working in chili I wasn't no everything but everyday they teach how to the food and prepare all the food before the time will come... Then after a two month a ago I was the most top off the coworker in chili...i got two positions like prep&dish..I was working all the day long when we have no worker I will cover them.
good,"it's honestly a great place to work as long as you do your job and get along with your managers "
good,Chili's donated and fundraiser for St. Judes children hospital. Had company outings and picnics. Its was a great working atmosphere like family. It was a positive working environment.
good,"I've been with them 9 years cant move up but a new guy moved up in a year he was literally one of the laziest workers we had but doesnt work there now and I've been devoted to them, but I do make a good about of money just severing 30 hours a week."
good,"It was a good place to work at, I appreciate that the managers are understanding and makes it easy to work and their flexable with the schedule."
good,"Wokked a Chili""s at the airport, my restaurant was a training restaurant. As a manager, I was sent to open and observe other locations. Each manager was assigned different positions in the restaurant but we knew all of them to help out or take over when needed."
good,"Chili’s could be very hard at times. Clientele was extremely demanding, especially on weekends. I enjoyed working days during the week. They gave me a consistent schedule."
good,"The days of work varied . Some days It would be very fast paced and busy. Other days it would be slow and monotonous. I learned to adapt to all kinds of situations and management was very kind and understanding. The workplace is a very friendly and fun atmosphere. The hardest part of the job was to deal with unhappy customers when it isn't in your control. All in all, it was a very enjoyable job."
good,"o	Provides quality beverage and food products consistently for all customers by adhering to the recipe and presentation standards. Follows health, safety and sanitation guidelines for all products."
good,"Lots of double shifts, good crew when I was there"
good,"Fast pace,learned how to work multiple stations,management is helpful,kind,the hardest part of the job is getting the food out on time,the most enjoyable part is when you accomplish the day with no bad ticket times..."
good,"Brinker, the parent company of Chilis is a good company to work for they offer great insurance, vacations, and work life balance that is probably one of the better in the industry"
good,"Es buena empresa para aprender, los meseros ganan bien c:"
good,"Aqui aprendi a hacer caja, uno misma lo es, pude conocer otro tipo de personas, extranjeros, y compañeros y es un buen ambiente laboral."
good,"Following corporate guidelines there are no room for mistakes and little time to learn how to avoid error.  Learning deadlines are required for every trainee, every employee is taught front and back of the house duties.  Step by step corporate sales techniques, up selling, suggestive sales, etc. Being punctual and maintaining a positive attitude is the key to success in this work place. The hardest part was staying in line with all the fine details of corporate management rules. There is a lot to learn and remain mindful of.  What I enjoyed the most was the speedy assets the restaurant supplied for us to maintain a functional yet quick paced environment."
good,A typical day at Chilis in Huntsville could be slow as molasses or busy as a bee. It's a college town so it has its ups and down. I've learned to get ahead and stay focused on the job. I've also learned time management and techniques on being humble. Management team is awesome. Some of the best people I've met in my life came from being a Chili Head. The hardest part about my job is the people because you have so many people in your ear that it's hard to focus on the task at hand. The most enjoyable part about my job definitely is the smiling faces of the customers.
good,"A day at Chilli's was pretty typical. We used our team for almost everything that we did there. Without your team almost nothing was possible. Most of the time we as servers had to deal with very complicated customers, but our manager was always there for any misunderstandings. No matter how complex. I am used to dealing with complicated people and not retaliating to any situation. As a manager, this was my specialty."
good,Es un empleo donde tienes mucha oportunidad de crecimiento y con muchas ayudas para crecer como empleado y persona. Es un trabajo magnifico para alguien que este estudiando ya que ofrece horarios flexibles.
good,Chili is an excellent place to work. The staff and management are courteous and helpful to customers and other employees. If i could i would go back. Thanks for your time
good,"It is a good job if you have prior serving experience. It can be tough at times, especially during the week when there are not a lot of servers but the restaurant is busy."
good,I was sick with cancer chili's help take care of my family while I was out. They also gave my gift when my baby was born. Also they have 100% discount while at work 50% when your off.
good,"Every job has its own issues and, I certainly have my own fair share of gripes with Chili's. You wont work anywhere that is perfect. If you work hard others will respect you, bottom line. Go into any job with that mentality, here is no different. Standard line cook job. Management works really hard here for the most part and has always been more than fair with me. My GM came and jumped my car one time. It can be stressful here but,for the most part it is pretty easy. You can listen to music on the speakers or after close put in your headphones close up shop.  Very little micro management."
good,"Me enseñó a valorar más lo que tengo y el trabajo, cambio mi falta de compromiso y después de eso aprendi a ser más responsable."
good,Fast paced environment. Management is nice and so are the coworkers. Just make sure you do your job correctly and always go a step above your required duties
good,Chilis is great company that hires fun and fresh staff. If you love a fast pace upbeat environment this is the place to be. The hours are flexible and fits most schedules.
good,I worked at chilis for a while and really understood what it meant to provide good customer service. It was a fast paced invironment which I enjoyed. Overall a good place to work at.
good,"Its been a great experience so far for me working there, they gave me the opportunity to work there and i am really greatful for it, so yes its definitly a good place to work"
good,i like where I work and the people I work with.a hundred and fifty characters ? really? How is this helping me find a job? I thought I was doing A resume and you guys tricked me into a survey.
good,"I enjoyed my coworkers, but ultimately sometimes the tips were disappointing.  I’m still very good friends with many of the people who I met at this workplace."
good,"During the week it is slow but as it gets closer to the weekend it gets really busy, especially during lunch and dinner hours.  The management was good and the hardest part of working there is making sure you get the order right!  I enjoyed because we get discounts too and not only chilis but at other restaurants as well."
good,You work hard in a high paced environment but the staff is always well trained and the culture is great. Loved my job but I ran into issues with a poor manager who had it out for me and cause far more stress then need be.
good,"me encanto ser mesero aqui. Muy buen ambiente, excelente trato de todo el personal, facilidad de horarios y capacitación pagada y con comida."
good,En chilli'a se creaba un ambiente de familia donde todos estaban agustos con el lugar de trabajo
good,"A typical day at work would be just prepping veggies , meats and fish."
good,"The pay is good. The work gets difficult at times, but it's all worth t because Chili's is one of the top paying chain restaurant. It is hard work but worth it."
good,I genuinely love serving and interacting with people. If you aren social then this wouldn't be the job for you. Is stressful on weekends depending on management and the flow of kitchen. If you can handle stress you're good.
good,"Daily shifts included ordering, running shifts, and taking care of guests.I opened 3 stores and trained FOH and bartenders. The stores had sales from 105 k to 60 k on a consistent basis. It was a fun atmosphere and standards were set and met on a regular basis."
good,I loved the people I worked with and the guest that came through the door. I made great money in tips while I worked here and the management is always giving out praise where praise is deserved
good,I enjoyed working with people and giving a quality experience to all that i served.  I was happy to become a trainer and train new employees to keep the work place positive and running smoothly.  I loved my managers and was sorry to have to leave when I moved away.
good,I learned a lot of things in my advancement for career. I learn specifically pros and cons of restaurant management. The staff and culture is really fun. I enjoyed my time here.
good,"Chili's is s good place to work if you need a flexible schedule and need to make fast, good money. I would recommend if you are in school to make sure to give your manager a copy of availability."
good,The work day is pretty standard as far as the service industry goes.  This is a job where you walk in the door and sometimes have to just jump into the flow of things.  Other days you may walk in and leave 30 minutes later.  The best part about working as a server is the flexibility working when you need and not working when you need time off.  The hardest part of the job is knowing when your at your limit and taking some time off if needed.
good,"The restaurant business was my career for over 15yrs and I wanted to do something different. The business was good, however, being a general manager requires 24 hours of company time."
good,First ever cooking job where I fell in love with cooking . they allowed me to grow while grooming me for management and teaching me principles that I used still this day .
good,"I was working at one of the training restaurants with #1 ITR in the country so the management and team was filled with excellent hardworking individuals. I built customer service and multitasking skills that are now valuable when applying for other jobs. Serving can be a high-stress job, but it can also be very rewarding. I moved from hostess to Togo to Expeditor to Server in 6-8 months.. Learn the menu and ask questions if you want to move up!"
good,We always had a great time here. As long as you did your job and the guests were well taken care of then our management trusted we were doing our jobs correctly.
good,"i am proud that im a part of  chilis-heads, coz once your chili-head always a chili-head:) i learn a lot being part of them, by taking order  by respect you need to be kneel down as respect, how to communicate with co-worker making your on drinks running your food if full house, so this is it. as you welcome you if your new.."
good,Making sure orders are correct and come out on a timely fashion and providing great service to all guest working together as a team and making sure the store is presentable and clean that all time
good,"many guest in one day to interact with poor staff is one of typical day at my work. as India is one of the densely populated we have lot guests every day. we to try to manage guests for their comfort levels. staff at work place are friendly. management have good couch,empower, and productive and result-oriented."
good,Starts off slow and then the pace quickens like your usual restaurant. You can definitely tell when the restaurant would get busy and when it would die down.
good,"Chilis is a good place to work at.. Unfortunately, the pay rate is not high enough for a hostess to live off of. I feel like it would be a great job for someone with little to no bills. Everyone works as a team, and treats one another as family. I love the work environment."
good,Chili's grill and bar is one the highest quality training provider. The company pays attention in creating a fully equipped team that will deliver the best service.
good,"a day in work is full of work load, like at the start of your day till you finish its a non stop preparation for the operation, you also need to monitor everything you do, check all the stocks, temperature of every item you cook and prepare,. "
good,"It's a fun, fast paced environment. Best coworkers I ever had. Managers were great and really worked with you to help you improve your scores and tips."
good,always changing menu and friendly environment enticing people to come back and new customers to give it a try. always hiring new people and bringing in new ideas.
good,Great restaurant with excellent food and customer service .. You will leave with a smile on your face .. so come out and eat and have fun at chilis .. you will enjoy yourselves
good,"The job itself was good, if you need time off they gave it to you. The co-workers were very nice, management could have done better, but wasn't bad. it was a fast paced environment so you were never bored. the hardest part of the job was some customers like to make your life hard, but you still have to be really nice to them (even if they are calling you names). Some days were great, because you could walk out with 100$ in your pocket."
good,"Chilis es una empresa donde se puede trabajar de la mejor manera, existe mucho compañerismo y trabajo en equipo, y los encargados de tienda, estan comprometidos con su trabajo y con todo el personal para su crecimiento y desarrollo personal y profesional."
good,Nice place to work part time. Staff is great and management is pretty cool. As long as you request off two weeks in advance for weekends and such you can get them off and still have a life outside of work.
good,"Chilis was a fun and great place to work. The locals were always fun to talk to. Management always worked with your schedule. Food was always good. Servers made enough money to support themselves, managers made enough money to support a family. The shift hours for management are long, and you have to be willing to work weekends, holidays and nights. It's not the greatest schedule to raise a small family."
good,a typical day is after clocking in is getting your apron seeing what was left from the first shift and organizing all the dishes you have before you to see how to properly and timely wash them to ready to use again. i earned that you have to be alert and keep a quick pace that you wont get behind and frustrate yourself and others.
good,As a host customers come in and as they come in I greet them and seat them to their table. I learned that some customers can be picky on where they want to sit sometimes. The job isn't hard whatsoever. The most enjoyable part of the job is that you can watch all of the sports games on T.V. Our Chilli's Bar and Grill is not small but it feels up very quickly.
good,"I love working for Chilis.  This is the best restaurant i have ever worked for, and I wouldn't want to work for a different one.  They are not followers,  They lead the industry in innovation, have an amazing culture and truly give back to the community."
good,I'm a very hard worker I'm very dependable and love to help others! I'm very friendly with a positive attitude ready to learn new trades and willing to accept  any challenge  that comes my way!
good,"Great pay, reasonable management fair advantages. Very good company to work for. They are always hiring. The management (depending on their person) will give you many leadership opportunities."
good,Working for Chili's for the past 3-4 years has taught me how to deal with people regardless of their attitude or disposition. It is good for building customer service and communication skills.
good,As a server you get to meet a diversity of people from all backgrounds. It is a fast paced industry that does not rest until close. You get to treat people as your guests.
good,Chili's treats their employees great! My coworkers i had there make you feel like family and make life long friends. The managers treat everyone fairly and are willing to help you out when something comes up.
good,"At chilis, you learn a lot about teamwork, job culture, and how to give exceptional customer service. Chilis is a great company because it cares about its team members. Management and team members are family of sorts, we all work together to make it through the day. The hardest part of being a host at Chilis is keeping a positive attitude and friendly face even when you are having a bad day and customers are rude. The most enjoyable part of the job to me is the laid back environment."
good,"Fast paced always busy but you can still have a fun family atmosphere. Decent location, with access to summer vacationers from the lake and right of the highway for travelers."
good,"it's a restaurant so regardless it's gonna be hectic but the co workers are extremely funny and fun to work with, the system they use is easy to learn and management is more than willing to help you out if you don't understand something. Co-workers are extremely outgoing and you build a relationship with them. Goodluck getting weekends off though!"
good,"Chilis is a great company, but a hectic environment. No room for higher pay after promises for months of a raise. Great coworkers. The hardest part of my job is not being prepared for the shift when I come on. We are out of a lot of times daily that prevent me from being able to do my job efficiently."
good,Really enjoyed working here. Made great money but no benefits. Not a job I would want to turn into a career. I learned a lot about bartending here and dealing with customers
good,"I love working at Chili's because my coworkers are all positive and welcoming, it's fast-paced work, and I always can find something to do to help out the restaurant. I love the experience of working as a host, and I have the opportunity to eventually move up as a server."
good,Can be a bit stressful with impatient guests. Overall good company to work for. Hardest part is staying composed. Most enjoyable part is getting to build a relationship with your guests.
good,"The managers are usually really good about working with you on a schedule, they care about their employees and don't mistreat them like a lot of other jobs do. Hardest part of the job and most enjoyable part is dealing with people on a daily basis. Have to be able to multitask, have to work well under pressure."
good,"Chili's is a high energy fun place to work that is leading in introducing technology into the restaurant industry, consistent seasonal menu changes that brings a variety of options and value on their menu while still being faithful to their original core menu."
good,"A typical night at Chili's would be coming in and preparing all the vegetables and meat for the dishes on the menu, preparing food to be served. I learned how to properly use a knife. Management was great, I could only ask for more hours. The hardest part of the job was the heat in the kitchen but that all goes with your development as a chef. The most enjoyable part of the job was the pay checks!"
good,"This was a great first job, and the staff here was very lively and welcoming. The scheduling was very flexible and it was a great place to grow your skills in customer service."
good,In the diverse environment of the restaurant business I found it easy to learn new positions quickly and advance to better paying positions as desired. In the first year there I was able to learn and advance through three positions and then begin to train new employees. This large company has great opportunity for those who are willing to put forth hard work and willing to learn.
good,"I learned how to answer telephones and reserve guests tables."
good,"trabajar aquí en grandioso, el trabajo en equipo es bueno, hacer grandes amigos y compañeros, mi salida es por mejorar cada vez más"
good,Always a good work environment. Good management and servers. Not always the best amount of business or friendliest clientele. Flexible with schedules.
good,"I have enjoyed my time working for Chili's. However, I'm looking for a full time job that isn't currently available to me at Chili's. "
good,"The hardest part about the job is the situations you are put under. Some of the time, large amount of stress is pounded onto your shoulders with the high demand of people coming in that door. Up front is not bad but when you are in the kitchen, it can get really hectic."
good,"The Management Team helps us grow to become effective, efficient and competent with the high standards that we learned throughout trainings. Employees began motivated and happy with harmonious relationship and as a result a happy team member = a happy guest."
good,"es suave como cualquier día,a trabajar en equipo eso no sebe así nomas en cualquier sitio ,bueno la gerencia general es buena,pero los que lo asisten o asistentes aveces carecen de criterio,los colegas son bien humanos y comprenden a quien no sabe o es nuevo,es la falta de criterio en cuidar sus maquinas de trabajo como las freidoras parrillas etc ,repetir la forma de cuidado cansa aveces ,la buena atención de las personas que  laboran allí te aceptan como uno de ellos desde el primer dia"
good,"I liked every thing about of the job."
good,"I have truly enjoyed my time with Chili's. I feel that this company genuinely believes in the importance of making each and every guest feel important and special. Employees are trained and mentored to fulfill this mission, and for the most part, are provided with the necessary resources to reach associated goals. Chili's uses daily survey outcome data from guests in order to make necessary improvements. "
good,"Tener todo listo y preparado para recibir a muchos invitados que gustan de la Marca, manteniendo los estandares propios de esta. Manejar al corazon de la casa que es el equipo de cocina, brindarles las facilidades y herramientas necesarias para poder operar de manera optima. Un dia en el trabajo es enfocarte en dar calidad en servicio y comida propios de una Marca Lider en el Rubro de Casual Dining. Dirigir y enfocar al personal para estar alineados en direccion al exito operacional hace que Chilis sea una Marca consolidada y primera opcion dentro de un Pais donde la comida es una de las principales atracciones.De eso hemos sido responsables no solo los gerentes sino tambien todo el equipo de colaboradores que trabajan y confian en nosotros como Marca."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of me reassuring that guests were enjoying there visit and feeling welcomed. Very good environment also helpful making sure everyone including other employees felt secured and if needed be helped if needed. "
good,This was an amazing job where I got to have fun but working for tips can become very stressful because some days you are not guaranteed to make anything. The management was very understanding and good to get along with. We were like a family there.
good,"Fun and great place to work. Great management, flexible hours with great effort to help it's team members. High pressure work but staff is great with teamwork and helping one another."
good,I've always loved this company and if you have the right management team it can be an awesome experience.  They promote from within and keep it a little light hearted.
good,"I have worked at 2 different Chili's and at both places the management has been amazing. They work with you when you need help to work around your scheduling, which is always appreciated."
good,"Young, generally cool, managers. They are always short servers, which means if you get hired, you will be asked to work a lot. I was in school and the managers were very understanding of my academic time commitments."
good,Chilis is a great place to work.  It has such a positive and upbeat atmosphere.  It is a very flexible position and you are trained by the best servers at Chilis.  I love working there and enjoy heading to work each day.
good,I enjoyed working at Chili's. It was highly conducive to pursuing my education. I would highly recommend working for Chili's to anyone seeking fair pay and flexible scheduling.
good,Chili's is a part of the Brinker International family and they usually offer a great atmosphere for both your working and dining experience.
good,A typical day at Chili's requires you to be very outgoing and personable. I learned a lot about time management and balancing multiple activities at once. The management is very understanding and cooperative when there is something happening in your personal life or at work. The co-workers are a huge reason why the job is so enjoyable. They each bring different strengths and weaknesses to the restaurant but at the end of the day they are like family. The hardest part of the job would have to be no set time when you are done with work. The most enjoyable part of the job are the co-workers and the people you meet.
good,"Great work environment, wonderful staff, great management with great scheduling options with lots of potential to move into management."
good,"A day at Chili's is like no other, I've been in retail and have been all about customer service but being a server is a different ball game. Working retail and waiting on guests is a different experience because you really need to know how to read people. Typically in a 5 or 6 hour shift you can see anywhere from 20 to 100 guest interactions on your lonesome depending on business. Being at Chili's I've learned better multi-tasking skills than before and learned how to speak to people better than before as well. Recently there has been a change in management a couple times but no matter who it is you still must get the job done whether you like or disliked the changes. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with difficult guests that would like to be, rude, ignorant, or just disrespectful. Keeping cool in difficult situations has also been another strength that I picked up along the way. What I enjoy most is that I made someone leave happy with their service and their food."
good,I like staying busy and interacting with people all day. I would serve guest and do my daily cleaning. I became certified trainer and go to train all the new employes.
good,"A typical day at work for Chili's included a lot of physical work and movement. By working here, I learned the value of teamwork and efficiency. The most enjoyable part of working here was how well management motivated and rewarded employees."
good,"Typically you work 10 hour day 5 days a week and have a bit of quality of life. I learned a lot about prepping fresh product. I also developed great marketing skills. The management and co workers where good. The Hardest part was weekend dinners ,but that wasn't too bad. The most enjoyable part of job was being able to get out in community, and the company baseball games and contests."
good,"It's about average 10 hours workday."
good,"Great serving system that encouraged teamwork amongst servers by having servers work as partners in a larger zone. I learned how to give help but also be able to take help. One of the things that could have been better was the fact that there were no bussers and that responsibility fell entirely on the servers, and I felt sometimes that took away from my ability to spend time with my guests."
good,Great place to work.  Very flexible and fun environment.  Learned organization skills and became good at doing many tasks at once.
good,My co-workers were the best part of this job. They were amazing. I worked To-Go so the shifts were really short but I made a decent amount of money.
good,Everyone I worked with are amazing people. They take the time to get to know you and really make you feel like part of the Chili's family. Management was always willing to work with my schedule. Honestly the best first job a person could ask for.
good,"Managers set you up for success and your peers help you arrive there. However, there are a lot of staff and hours do not always come easy."
good,Fun place to work as all jobs can be hard but with a team it great
good,"Chili's Grill and Bar in Encino, CA, required great customer service skills, the ability to work as part of a team, and be fast on one's feet. There is very little downtime in the service industry, so a typical day included a lot of movement, i.e. greeting customers, serving food and drinks, making alcoholic beverages, and ensuring guest satisfaction. The most difficult part of the job was confrontation from customers unhappy with their meal. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to address the unhappy customers' dissatisfaction, and improve their experience."
good,"Provided customer service throughout your entire day, making sure customers where as satisfied as possible, being consistent with our drink orders, hands on customer service, food, and much more. I learned excellent customer service skills when being extremely busy and also when slow. Excellent management; always willing to work with you whether it be trips, school, etc. Very reliable company whether it be with your employees, management or overall food and drinks."
good,"A typical day at work at Chilis was always a new surprise. Chilis is a corporate restaurant so that taught me structure and organization. The hardest part of working there was the fact that it was in one of the biggest malls in America, so it was constantly busy. Sometimes, it was a bit overwhelming. I did enjoy working there because money was great and it constantly kept me running around."
good,A typical day at work is smooth and efficient.  I have learned how to be a great leader.  Management is fair and supportive.  My co-workers and friendly and helpful. The hardest part of my job is controlling the high volume of customers.  The part I enjoy most about my job is the flexibility.
good,"With great food and a pleasant atmosphere, Chili's has virtually everything you would want in a restaurant,  Quick and attentive wait staff and accurate, passionate kitchen staff. All combined to create a warm environment and pleasing dining experience that you will both love and remember."
good,"Its a real laid back, cool job. The only drawback, I guess, would be rude customers, and those that don't tip."
good,"A typical day at work is walking in, and doing your job right away until it is not busy anymore and you can leave. I learned about how important it is to micro-manage in this field, and that individuals will look-up to you and listen to you if you know what you are doing and show confidence. Good co-workers, very friendly and was like family. Hardest part of the job was quitting. Most enjoyable was relaxing when it wasn't busy and talking with others."
good,"I loved working at Chili's mostly because of the family dynamic I grew to know between my fellow employees and also the management. Because it was such a high-volume store we were able to work hard and always have something to do whether that was serving 8-10 tables at once, bar tending and serving, answering the phones, preparing large orders to-go, or meeting with management. I was a very trusted employee and often was asked to do many different things at once. Depended on by other servers, the guest, the kitchen, and the management made me want to work even harder at all aspects of the job."
good,Chili's is a place where you feel like family the environment is fun and exciting.
good,very comfortable environment. Loved my co-workers. Met a lot of new people.
good,Great benefits.  Potential to make a good living. Discounts on meals.
good,it is a great work place to be. I recommend to any one who is looking for a great place to start in the restaurant business
good,"The job was easy as long as my other co-workers did their task as well.  Many times I had to pick up the slack of other workers to make the BOH in a smoother running atmosphere.  My GM  was very nice and was willing to help.  The hardest part of the job was when some of my co-workers failed to be co-operative.  I enjoyed my time their most because the atmosphere was lively and entertaining.  I learned many tasks i.e. Fry Cook, Prep Cook.  I learned that hard work and team work make a restaurant successful."
good,Working for Chili's gave me the opportunity to discover new talents and skills. I had the opportunity to fine tune my management skills and customer service skills. In this position I had was given the opportunity to discover a joy for adult beverage mixology.
good,"When I would come in to work, I would check on where I was to work in the resonant. Then I would wait to be sat in rotation. When I would be sat, I would approach the table with a warm greeting smile and silverware. I would always ask how they were doing and then tell them my name. I would first get their drinks and put in appetizers while I give them a few minuets to look over the menu; sometimes I had to do menu tours if they had never been to Chili's before and tell them about some of my favorite items. Once they had decided, I would put that into the computer and around that time their appetizer would come out for my table to eat while their food would be per paired. I would always check up on my tables and keep their drinks filled. When every one was done, I would offer to go boxes and offer desert. Then finally give the table their check. My job was very enjoyable! My co workers were fun and outgoing, they would just make my day awesome. My managers were laid back but still kept everyone in line. When I needed time off or if I was sick, they would always help me out getting my work covered. Over all I had a great time working at Chili's."
good,I loved working at Chili's The management team was great and so were my coworkers. We were like family. It was a poor decision leaving there. I should have worked my way up the management chain
good,"I enjoyed working for Chilis. I loved the atmosphere, my co-workers and my managers. Chilis is a team. Respectful place"
good,"a typical work day is busy, i am busy coordinating schedules, making sure we have enough product, making sure food is out in a timley manor and making sure our guests have a good experience. we have great staffing management and coworkers get along well and are very productive, the most challenging part about the job is time management/ multitasking but that is also enjoyable, because i enjoy being challenged and taking pride when all the work is done correctly and on time."
good,Great company to work for - management encouraged advancement and provided opportunities. The Cincinnati locations slowly closed down due to economy. 
good,Chili's prides itself in taking their work seriously but not themselves. I have had a great time working there.
good,"i am learn the team work "
good,I can only think of a couple cons to working here. The first being the lack of training by other employees and the pay. Other than that I actually enjoyed working here considering it was my first actual restaurant job. Almost all of the management team is awesome. They really do work with you and are definitely there to help you out with any scheduling problems or any other issues. I made a lot of great friends and would recommend people applying here.
good,"The staff is wonderful, the management does what is best for the company, favorite part is the atmosphere."
good,"Daily team meetings to prepare everyone for the shift. helped me learn a lot about team work and customer service/experience. management was always there to assist you with any task you needed, all of my co-workers were very friendly and help create the culture to an amazing work environment that people could feel as soon as they walked into the doors. it was a very fast pace environment that helped me train to pace myself through them and not let them overwhelm me but execute busy, and achieve great customer service while doing so. everyone was a team player always on the same page and help create a fun, enjoyable work environment they they are know for."
good,Fast paced work place and there was always room for achievement and recognition.
good,i loved working at Chili's it was a very fast paced work place that provided a great atmosphere.
good,"Chilis is a great place to work, especially for college students."
good,If the management was better it could be an awesome place to work. The company as a whole was totally awesome. It gave back to the community and we always did stuff for st judes childrens hospital. We had company picknics and where we competed against other stores. It made it intersting. The store itself had plenty of room for improvement.
good,"I love Chili’s. Great Company, great Leaders and an amazing program for development  compensation is reasonable and competitive  Expect to work, and be a team player"
good,Working at Chilis I was able to balance my work life and personal life very well. I was able to have a flexible schedule while keeping my grades above average.
good,"Although working in a restaurant can get repetitive, they were grooming me for a management position so it added a level of difficulty that challenged me daily."
good,"Great place to work. Scheduling system and server ratings are not efficient. Effects your shifts and job stability. Great money, work environment, and company culture. Awesome management."
good,"Since the first interview till the last day I worked for Chili’s, they were on it in every department and it was VERY nice to work there. There wasn’t a single shift that I worked where I felt “dang that sucked” or felt that management wasn’t doing there job; they were on it every single week."
good,"Food, not so great. Management at my location was the best I've ever had, however, and kept me a happy employee there for over two years, which is not easy to do in the food service industry. They fostered a culture of fun hard work. Somehow it paid dividends. Good job Chili's."
good,"This was an easy job - but because of that, compensation is not the greatest and your co-workers are not  the most knowledgeable. It is geared toward the corporate citizen."
good,"Chili's was a pretty cool place to work at when I was working there. This is actually a good place to begin to build thick skin, learn about customer service, and understand how to be quick. This is a pretty fast paced job, so try to keep up with everything that you do. Most of the people I worked with were nice and friendly. Management always wanted to hear what you have to say and would even reward you for providing excellent service. Overall, the job is pretty cool if you can keep up while still providing good service."
good,Good workplace friendly environment nice staffing and management organized on time ran right outspoken fast pace overall great place to work and meet new people
good,"My Time at Chili's has helped me expand my social bubble and understand the fast pace world of the food industry. Always keeping me busy, and productive. However, most of hiring happens from outside rarely ever opportunities to get promoted."
good,"Great atmosphere. Some things could have been different with certain managers. Its easy to pick up hours. Everyone fights to become bartender, but that’s every restaurant! Easy for servers to become managers/shift leads."
good,"It's quick paced. you get good money ( if you can do the job well) for little time. It's best if the economy is good so that you get better tips. Otherwise you are making $2.15 an hour"
good,"Chilis tiene un ambiente muy dinamico en que son mas jovenes y adultos donde se trabaja en grupo como una familia, super recomendado"
good,"Worked here for 3 years best place to start out, friendly staff, good work environment very clean relaxed and fast paced you are always going to be on your feet and you make great tips"
good,Chili's is always changing to became better. You must be willing to adapt to change and quickly. They have amazing tools to develop their staff to the the best they can be in the hospitality industry.
good,"I actually really loved  working for chili’s . It was a fun environment. It was barely a dull moment . I loved my managers , I also met new people everyday . It was a fun and exciting job ."
good,Great place if you have other things that take priority like school or family. they are willing to work with your schedule. the place is fast paced but worth it if you find the right location.
good,"En general es muy buena la marca el problema en mi caso fue la pésima relación laboral con mis compañeros,"
good,"Work was always fun! Always contests to keep team members involved in selling items such as margaritas or desserts! Chilis also participated in Family Nights, we would organize events and invite neighboring schools clubs etc to join us and celebrate the fun including characters dressed up photo opportunities and fun games for families and kids"
good,"Very flexible schedules. Fun fast paced, team culture. always opportunities to cross train and get extra shifts to make extra cash. Fair and great management."
good,"This by far was my most enjoyable job. Although fast paced most times, the co-workers makes it better. Everyone gets along great like a family. Very helpful and nice Management."
good,"worked here for several years and built a family through the company. They take care of their employees and are teamwork focused. Each location is different, but for the most part values are consistent throughout"
good,I love chilis and being a chili head. My managers are always behind my back and there for me when I need them. I would recommend working here to anyone.
good,"Very competitive, tips are your way of making money as a server. Everyone is really nice. Must have good attitude. Management is great. Loved working here and would probably go back if ever needed to."
good,"Ive learned a lot in this company, how to manage my time, i learned very fast frim my team member and to my manager because they are all knowledgeable to the menu’s."
good,"Chili's is a fun place to work at! Everyone there is so welcoming! The managers there are beyond nice and whenever you have a problem, you actually listen to you. I would recoomend working at Chili's!"
good,"A good job especially if you’re in school."
good,i would like to skip this section of questioning at this time i need to get some where and dont have time to completely fill out at this point in time will come back later
good,"I loved working at Chili's! I have been a server for 16 years, and I made the most money here! Great environment,  and all around amazing team! I would go back to work for Chili's with no hesitation! Probably my favorite job so far!"
good,"The corporate office has a great work/life balance. There is a lot of great diversity. Although it is a fast-paced environment, it's a fun and productive environment."
good,"Working as Shift Leader leader at Chili's is / was an exciting adventure. Because everyday is new opportunity to learn something new . It is a great feeling having people looking for me help, advice , and training."
good,"My career expierience at Chili's was amazing. i was able to get along with everyone,  i enjoyed constant changes to the business and the menu to alway insure satisfactory customer service while abiding by Ca. health code regulations!"
good,I enjoy working with this company. They always try and work with you and they always make the shifts run as smooth as they can. I really appreciate the hardworking coworkers.
good,"I loved working with Chili's. After acclimating to the required skills, I always made enough money and could pick up shifts to pay the bills. I loved working as a team to make the floor thrive and run efficiently, and I enjoyed every different position in the restaurant that I was a part of. The culture varies depending on location, but is typically very family-esque as is frequent in food service. The hardest part was dealing with dissatisfied customers - but a good manager makes even those moments easier to deal with well."
good,"It unlike any other restaurant where they keep on you about numbers and quality service. Overall, it is a fun place to work once you get the handle on your team and the job requirements. If you act like an adult you get treated like an adult. At my specific location, the regulars made the job fun."
good,Culturally driven company that invested a lot of time in their management and team members. Chili's has top notch training for all managers and team members.
good,"If you are a hard worker and don't call in or slack off you have the opportunity to close lunch and dinner shifts, bartend, shift manage and train others.  This is a good place to work if you're willing to work hard and give good customer service.  If you don't like helping others or doing your assigned job then this is not the job for you.  Work days can be slow and boring or can be fast paced and stressful, how you handle the situations depends on the tips you bring home."
good,"I really loved Chili's. My coworkers were all great. At time the job was VERY stressful. often there wasn't enough people working at a time, and the restaurant would get very busy and it'd be very hard to keep up"
good,Great place to meet people. I met so many great managers and guests.  Everyday was a new experience.  Great getting through college job. I made good money while finishing my degree.
good,The Summer of 2015 I needed a job for part of the Summer before school started. This was my first job and I was new to the job industry. The managers helped me fit in right away and taught valuable skills. Chili's is a good restaurant chain to work for.
good,I don't have any complaints with chilis what so ever. management was great. working there was like working as a family more then a team. it was a great work environment!
good,"I have been working with this company for one year now. It has had its ups and downs, but at the end of the day I truly enjoy the people I work for. There are plenty of chances to advance with Chili's. Not only are there chances to advance but also great benefits. I love this company."
good,"Normalmente en un día de trabajo los gerentes (Cocina y Servicio) hablaban con los empleado sobre qué objetivos tenían que cumplir durante todo el día y cómo iban a lograrlos; cocina: comidas hechas con la menor cantidad de demoras, para ello surtido de todas las áreas y preparación con anticipación de algunos platillos con mucha demanda, servicio: una buena venta de promociones del día sugiriendo platillos y/o bebidas durante el pedido de comida, lo anterior apoyándose entre compañeros y áreas. Después de hablar sobre los objetivos del día, cada gerente asignaba a alguien diferente por día para liderar al resto y decía unas cuantas palabras o frases para animar a sus empleados."
good,This is by far the most functional and cooperative restaurant I've worked at. They work with their employees on schedules and training and foster communication. If I wasn't looking to leave the industry entirely I would be very comfortable settling in with Chili's for the long haul.
good,"It was fine. Chili's was a job, a means to an end, I considered myself to be very good at my job and loved all the people that I worked with, for the most part. There was nothing hard about the job and a typical day just meant nobody yelled at you."
good,Great place to work.  Great food and management was awesome.  Chili's was great to work for.  Big company but they learned the right way to treat employees!
good,"Being a server at Chilies was a great way to boost your customer service skills. Everyday was different in it's own way. If you are able to multitask and provide knowledgeable information to the customers in timely and professional manner, then being a server would be a great fit."
good,"I absolutely loved working with my team members! We understood that we were all there to make money, as well as help each other make money. Many of whom are good friends of mine and we had fun working together, but most importantly; got the job  done well enough to bring in regulars."
good,"I worked at two locations. I thoroughly enjoyed the first Chili's I worked at. The team was like family to me. When I transferred because I moved, I didn't like the staff because they had low morale to work hard, and the customers were even more demanding, so it wasn't a good working environment."
good,"Local management is wonderful to work for, and you create your own pay according to the level of service you provide.  What's not to love!  Boredom is unlikely, since every day brings an opportunity to meet new people."
good,"Basically when I walk inside and clock in, I go to the host stand and update the Roster, then greet any customers who start walking inside. When we start a wait list because of how busy its getting, I get everybody's names written down, wait to hear what booth or table is open, call the persons name and have he/she and their family sat. It can be very stressful at times when the wait list gets really long and customers get mad that they have to wait, but i manage it well. As hard as it is some nights, I also enjoy when it gets very busy, simply because it makes time fly by, and because I like a challenge. The managers make it a good time, always willing to help sit customers or clean around with me. I can easily say that one important thing I learned is to treat people with respect. It goes a long way."
good,"El trabajo es muy divertido aprendí a preparar platos al día elaborando desde 150 platos a mas, los compañeros eran muy buenos, lo mas difícil era el la hora punto en la cual llegaban mas clientes y teníamos que  que elaborar los platos mas rápido, lo que mas me gusto es que me sentía cómodo trabajando ahí."
good,Chilis is an upbeat job that is a fun environment to work in. very difficult to manage work and a healthy family life style with this position.  Hours vary daily along with shifts.
good,"True family-like experience.  Through long hours,  and in the trenches absolute friendships were formed.  Great place to grow.  Started in Sumter,  SC then Myrtle Beach, SC,  then Summerville.  Had a home in every store"
good,"Enjoyed working here but certain job duties that were added to the description without additional pay made the job harder. Worked w/ my schedule but during rush hours other cooks became easily stressed. The higher ups could definitely afford to pay their cooks more, making the same or $1 less than ppl who had been there 3-5 years."
good,"Long days and stretches without a day off, grew as an operator in a short time. Excellent culture for team members and for the guests."
good,"I worked at 2 different chilis, and there is no consistent part of any of it. I loved my job and only had to leave for school, but if you can get a good supervisor this will be the best job ever."
good,"Never a dull moment while working there, especially the evening shift.  Great fun people to be surrounded with and management was always very supportive."
good,"# 1 Chili's in Virginia."
good,"-A typical day at work consisted of serving guests and making sure the restaurant was ready for business at all times"
good,"Muy buena empresa, renuncia debido a no poder ayudarme con horarios de la universidad a distancia por cuestiones políticas de la empresa."
good,"the most enjoyable part of job was when the co-workers work in teams, and the management help me to learn more about the administration area inside the restaurant."
good,"Fast-paced restaurant environment with team service-minded, frequent promotions, and high volume!  Good food fast!"
good,Worked great with my schedule while attending school. Amazing staff and good managment. I would recommend anyone to work here. Would work here again myself
good,Fun place to work and make money. There is a lot of shift flexibility. Great team to be apart of. Lots of contests and opportunities to challenge yourself.
good,"Worked at Chilis for around five years and stayed for so long because I was treated with respect by management, created life long friendships with coworkers and guests and not to mention they money isn't too bad!"
good,"not a bad place to work, management has come a long way with being more understanding and reliable. it is a great place to meet new people and get your feet in the door with management"
good,"Enjoyed working with the crew at chili's. Very friendly people helped the restaurant run very smoothly. Management could have been a bit more resourceful, but overall a great experience."
good,Chili's was a great place to work as a highschooler. The pay was good they were willing to work with my schedule and if I didn't go to college I would probably still be working there.
good,"serving customers and delivering food services"
good,"es una excelente empresa, te dan facilidad para trabajar estudiar la mismo tiempo, tienen sueldos competitivos, facilidad de ascenso, buen ambiente de trabajo entre gerencia y miembros de equipo"
good,"En un día común el movimiento era muy tranquilo hasta la noche que empezaba todo y podíamos pasar el tiempo limpiando o haciendo alguna otra actividad."
good,"The typical day in the start of most restaurants are very similar.  You do a check to see the way things were left from the previous night.  Check sales from previous night,  Count what product is left on hand.  Compare to par and make daily prep sheets before a.m. prep cooks arrive.  Make sure computers are up and running properly.  Running reports from previous days labor.  This is a huge expense that some people overlook, and can cost a lot of money.  Make sure all employees that are scheduled for the day, actually show up for their shifts.  If not, try to find replacement or see if you can go without position to save on labor without hurting guest service (ex. Hostess).  Always read any manager communication logbook.  It may have a party of 25 that called last night for lunch today, that you would like to be prepared for or it could tell you any extremely important information that you may need to know.  between lunch and dinner, I feel it is very important to sit for 5 minutes and have a chat with any mgr's in that day, regarding any pertinent information.  Communication is HUGE in my opinion!  After that short meeting, a.m. manager orders produce if needed daily, balances the safe for his/her shift, and never leaves the building without their p.m. manager  being ""set up for success""!!! Before the night shift starts it's always a good idea to have a pre-shift mtg with all of your night employees.  Let them know anything new or maybe run a contest to increase sales, etc! Night Mgr is responsible for checking out all cleaning duties.  P.M. Mgr is also responsible for the"
good,"This job is a very up pace.  Very busy, maintain my co-workers and make sure all food is sent out to the guess correctly. This restaurant is very busy.  I love the change and i step to it with excitement.  Happy to be serving costumers."
good,"4 New menu roll outs per year, tight labor guidelines, good bonus structure"
good,"I love Chili's! It's fun, challenging, forward thinking. Chiliheads are an amazing culture! The benefits are decent. Job flexibility is my favorite part of working here. I've worked in two states, transferring is a huge plus as well. If you're fast, fun, motivated and love innovation-Chili's is probably the job for you!"
good,"Must learn the entire menu, everyday starts out a little slow but as soon as lunch time hits be ready to work and lots or running. Management is always willing to help on the floor which makes it very nice, hardest part of my day is making sure every guest is leaving the establishment is happy and their bellies are full. The people I've worked with make it that much better, we are one big happy family."
good,"I always greeted my co-workers, manager, or guest with a warm smile. I learned that most restaurants function the same. Just different rules, different faces, different clientele, and different food. Although each manager had certain rules and functioned in different ways, that's normal. Adapting to how each one preferred to get the job done was not a bother at all. The hardest part of the job was feeling unappreciated and unacknowledged for hard work or going above and beyond expectation. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with different guests every hour because they were all so different. I also enjoyed my co-workers because we were just like a dysfunctional family."
good,fun people to work with prep meals and clean and sanitize equipment as well as wash dishes
good,Great workplace. Friendly coworkers. Great pay. flexible hours and understanding manangement
good,"best and most fun team training"

good,Overall it's a great place to work. I have to make sure the dishes are clean and presentable for the customers. My co-workers are pretty nice. The hardest part of my job is lifting the crates for the bar and the trash bags can get pretty heavy.
good,"Enjoyable place to work, a different thing every day and cash tips every day made it hard to know your exact pay every week and some day's could be better than other's."
good,"provide customers support by serving food and drinks, and maintain the area clean. "
good,There was not a day that went by that I could not wait to get to work! It had a great atmosphere the management team worked very well with the employers. If you went above and beyond your job you got recognized (sometimes). 
good,Chilis is a great place to work. I do alot of cleaning there. The managment and coworkers are realy nice people.
good,Horarios muy axesibles disponibilidad buen sueldo buen ambiente de trabajo
good,A typical work day is fast paced and full of fun. I learned how to multi-task and become a leader. The hardest part of this job is handling 6 tables at a time.
good,I like the staff that i worked with and the management was ok. The company was always pretty bust which was good. I like staying busy. But the restaurant buisness is kind hard and can be stressful.
good,"While working at chili's, I've learned alot...I love the customers chili's brings, i love the location, I've learned more then just customer service. I learned to love myself and embrace my personality."
good,Its a okay place to work the hours and pay are good and the menus are easy to learn so its not nothing to hard as long as you learn easy and work hard its a perfect job
good,I really enjoy working for Chilis restaurant! We all work together as a team and family to make our experience as employees and the customers experience an unforgettable one! Go Chiliheads!
good,My experience with Chili's was great really fast paced alot of employees there were under the influence of alcohol or drugs which got me to relapse and I ended up leaving never returning
good,"A usual work day can vary, depending on they day. Very fast paste,with multiple tables opening and closing checks. I learned how to maintain multiple duties,without falling behind. The most enjoyable part was meeting new guest,and sharing a genuine experience."
good,Friendly and fun place to work. Fast paced and co workers and managers are understanding and work around schedules needed. When working with them have been there total of 12 years have made good friends we are a Chili’shead family. Raise money for ST Jude’s and come together when someone needs help.
good,Chili’s is my current job and I love it. The people I work with are awesome. It is a fast paced job but it’s easy to adapt to and the other servers are a huge help with getting food out to your table if you’re busy or bussing tables. I think it’s a great place for anyone looking for a change of pace and a job that pays well with the tips and keeps you moving.
good,"I loved the people I worked with there, and everyone helped each other with teamwork. However, it was too slow paced for e to continue working there, and it was a temporary summer job for me."
good,Chili's in Huntsville Texas has a great management team. And when it comes to the work environment is the perfect place to work for a young-adult. The only reason why I would like to to stop working here is order to further myself as an adult.
good,I personally love chilli's because it seemed as though it was a small family a great team working towards a common goal. I would definitely pursue management seeing how I love fast paced.
good,I very much working at this Chili's location. The management team is very good at there jobs and try to take care of there employees as best as they could. Other than there is very high turn over rate for the back of the house the company as a whole is very reasonable.
good,"My managers were attentive to every worker's individual needs and led effectively through positive reinforcement. I felt appropriately and frequently recognized for my good work, and felt comfortable bringing any issue to my manager's attention. This was a fun environment to work in. Fast paced but geared towards positivity and a team that felt more like family."
good,"As a hostess at Chilli’s I noticed it was a busy place and it drew my attention in, I was excited to work in a place that would help me grow. And indeed it did."
good,"a typical day at work was to get on with the day routine. I have learn to manage my time because that's the only way you can survive at chilis. the manage was not very good to my own view."
good,"The life of working at Chili's is fairly comparable to most serving jobs. At Chili's, the server is responsible for preparing the drinks, scooping the chips/salsa, and running the food out to the tables themselves. All tips are kept except for a small percentage (I believe 1.5%) of the alcohol sales which are tipped out to the bartender, unless it is one of the newly built restaurants where you must tip out the expo's."
good,Chili's strives to provide proper training to new hirees to prepare them for the fast paced restaurant environment. Everyone works as a team and management tries to make the job bearable.
good,"Day to day operating a business, keeping employees satisfied and providing customers a pleasant eating experience.  Ordering and inventorying supplies.  There was a chance for advancement."
good,"Fun location but it was over an hour to commute coupled with long shifts kept my family time short, The Director of operations is a great guy who cares about his people and does what he can to ensure the success of those working around him. I would recommend this company."
good,Overall good place to work. There's always ups and downs of about any workplace. Can request off a good amount of time at once. fast paced during lunch and dinner rushes.
good,Good place to work plenty of opportunities and great staff and management. Fair pay compared to most companies and plenty of work to do for you to earn it
good,Not really a hard job. Love the people. Can get hectic at times and sometimes things get outta hand but that's the nature of working in a restaurant. Management is excellent. They work with you as far as scheduling but sometimes it you're stuck.
good,"All in all a great place to work! Friendly co workes, great Managers. They work with you and are willing to teach you anything that you're willing to learn."
good,"Love it here favorite place to work, would love to work here again if It paid better I got bills. meet long lasting friends here. great for college students"
good,Tener entusiasmo para atender y brindar un  buena experiencia con los compañeros y clientes.
good,"Chili's had to be the best place I've worked never had a problem with anything or anyone, I had a simple job and a great co workers. I worked full time and made good money."
good,It is a great company to work for they will work with your schedule but must be willing to talk to them about what is going on. They honestly just expect you to do your job and nothing more.
good,"I loved working for Chili's because the management was great and always there when you needed them. I never felt out of place while working there and they make you strive to do your best and are always pushing for you. I enjoyed my time immensely there, and wouldn't hesitate to go back!"
good,The number one positive aspect of Chili's is that employees are made to feel valued by management.  No one group or individual is shown favoritism or exhibited to be perceived as above anyone else.  The compensation is appropriate for the work and the area in which this Chili's operates.  Overall it is an awesome place to work.
good,"Love the people I work with."
good,Chili's is a great place to work with a great atmosphere and co-workers in a welcoming atmosphere. They have a fast pace work day with very little downtime.
good,"I love working there. The people and money are great for servers! You meet a lot of people, you develop multiple friendships, and you serve great food!"
good,"As a newcomer, I felt welcomed and part of the ""Chilis-family"" in no time. Most managers are helpful, and the coworkers are amazingly awesome. All restaurants can be chaotic at time, on occasion understaffing can be a issue, but we always stick together and make it work. Unfortunately, worrying about your ""numbers"" can be frustrating, mainly because your customers don't understand that the survey they are taking effects your schedule and ranking, and this system is not fair at times. Especially when you do everything right, provide fast service, and your guests enjoy regularly coming to see you.. but things that are out of your control effect your scores as well(Example: Wait times for food, a loud child, or a under/over cooked burger can all get your customers to lower their overall experience score). Other than that, I sincerely look forward to going to work! Overall, 9/10."
good,"My Chili's is very relaxed, but when it's time to work we rock it.  Good money if you're willing to do the work.  Flexible schedule, discount cared good at all Chili's and Mangianos."
good,Chilis is a great place to serve. Not only is it a popualar place but this particular location is awesome because even on slow days the view is worth it. If you work a double you get a free meal and a break between shifts.
good,A typical corporate structured restaurant in casual dining. I like how they are always trying to improve and stay with the times. A lot of my business side of restaurants was learned here over a 7 year experience.
good,most of the people that work their are awesome people when you get to know them. when it gets busy know your duties and if u don't know the answer to a question ask a co worker or the mgr.
good,"Has put me through college and always been there for me."
good,I would have worked there for years but after the first year I was there they started cutting a lot of hours at my location especially in the kitchen.
good,I enjoyed this job moved up from host to server in a few months. Management noticed my work ethic and treated me with much respect. Great job.
good,The restaurant always cared about their customers the most. They would always try their best to please their guests and make sure there meal and visit at Chili's was nothing but the best.
good,"Loved working at Chili's. Every Chili;s has a diverse culture of different cooking backgrounds, and with enough support to pursue a future with the company. Most days it didn't feel like being at work."
good,"Chili's is a very refined company that has it's guests needs readily available. Brinker as a company allows for advancement wherever your starting position. They also offer extensive benefits and school funding to whomever may need these amenities. Management was well trained and I felt safe knowing that they had my back. Coworkers were experienced and fun to work with. As with any restaurant, rushes and high volume periods were often, but we were never short of supplies or help when needed. All in all, a great environment for both employees and guests alike."
good,"providing great customer service to each and every guest that takes a step into Chilis, while leading my employees with coaching and support to be able to provide great customer service. I have learned the essence of being a not just a manager but a leader/mentor to lead by example for my employees. With the daily tasks of deploying,coaching,managing and being on one accord with my management team by obtaining and with holding essential numbers. The most challenging part of my job is making sure all numbers are above expectations. My most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new guest each and every day while providing great customer service and motivating my team to accomplish all goals."
good,"There were a variety of positions I held. As a quality control representative I made sure I had all stock necessary to run the day's job successfully. After which I assured every dish came out picture perfect and as ordered for guest enjoyment. As a salad cook I was responsible for stocking my station before and after my shift so that my production was efficient for high  and low production times. I learned all the salads and appetizers and how to prepare them rapidly and with excellence. As a prep cook I was responsible for stocking and un-stocking the freezer and refrigerator. In addition to preparing items for the day's food service, where I was able to learn a variety of recipes and techniques for cooking. One of the friendliest and best manager's I have ever had was at chili's and he was a great example to learn from. The hardest part of the job was keeping up when we got super busy."
good,"Quality of products, still doing a lot of on hands prep, typical day at work making sure we are ready to open for the day prep sheets, line checks.Interacting with guest and tea members. I enjoyed our staff."
good,I would prefer to keep this little Gem a secret. Thank you for asking though! Most amazing place on earth.
good,"A typical day at work is fast paced, many diners, take out orders, lots of movement, communication, and dealing with customers, not always your own."
good,"Los turnos son muy amenos, el trabajo se hace agradable por el ambiente que se genera gracias a la forma de ser de los trabajadores y su manera de trabajar, siempre apoyandonos todos mutuamente."
good,"I enjoyed working here. It paid well, my employees and supervisor were very friendly, and it had a very fast work environment. The most difficult part of the job was adjusting to the fast-paced environment, but it was also my favorite part because it gave me a challenge - and I like a good challenge."
good,"Through working at Brinker as a bartender I have constructed an amazing group of friends/colleagues as well as regulars that have impacted my life mostly for the better. I have been able to enhance my ability to effectively manage time as well as my verbal communication skills, you're often selling yourself as well as the products offered. The management does their best to accommodate requests and keep things running smoothly at all times while keeping moral as high as possible with the given restraints of upper management and budget. Overall a very good place to work, I do enjoy my job, and would highly recommend this institution to those in search of a medium that allows for creativity and upward movement."
good,"Best part about this job was the quarterly staff meetings. They always did their part in recognizing the employees that stood out to them over the past few months and there were always awesome door prizes. My co-workers loved working here which made it a more fun environment to come to every day. I learned a lot about teamwork, how to time food and how to handle some uncomfortable guest situations."
good,From the time I was there things went well and I liked my job cooking food and preparing food and the people were all great along with management until we got this one guy. The hardest part of the job was making sure you were getting everything out on time and cooking things right.
good,"a great place to work,great customers and some great employees"
good,it was a great expirence working there love the people i worked with they was easy to get along with they welcome me with open arms show me things i needed to know. management was great
good,"At Chili's, there's always something to do and everyone works together to get what needs to be done, done."
good,"Some days are long hours and others are not. It is a fast paced environment that keeps you on your toes and great customer service is always key. The jobs is much easy when you have a good support staff that is willing to help each other succeed. The hardest part of my job is picking up the slack of the employees that are not working hard enough. However, there is a great chance for advancement within the company as long as you are willing to apply yourself to your job."
good,"I enjoyed working for Chilis. It was a friendly and positive environment. The managers took their time with explaining how to run things, and took a personal interest in the employees personal lives."
good,I really enjoyed working at Chili's. They had some great employees and were good at keeping everything equal. If I was still near the location I would return to work there.
good,I really enjoy working for chili’s. It’s a fast paced difficult job. It takes hard work and dedication to make sure those ticket times are low. It’s been one of the best jobs I’ve ever had.
good,"Empresa que se preocupa por sus empleados, y que te dan muchas prestaciones."
good,"Good company to find a career and advance. A lot of structure, tools to succeed in training. Coaching tools and business tools to develop team members readily available"
good,Chili's is very high volume and great for an experienced bartender to make some decent money. I've worked for this company for 6 years and its been a pleasant experience.
good,"Chilis was a great place to work the guests became my family as well as the staff all the locations  that I managed. "
good,es un buen lugar para trabajar ya que siempre se esta capacitano al personal
good,"A great company to work for with a wonderful work environment.  A laid back type of work culture, people friendly and animal friendly! Very engaged business team that works collaboratively with the IT team to drive delivery of projects."

good,"fast paced a lot of socializing have to have good memory, a lot of long hours a lot of different personalities... great food short breaks no paid vacations"
good,"chili's welcomed me with open arms and was a huge milestone in my working career."
good,I loved working here managers where cool employees where just as cool everyone work together and the pay was great i got paid every 2 weeks and was a pretty big check.
good,"I have worked here for awhile and for the most part it is a fun, interactive place to work. The people you work with on a day to day basis can be fun and guests can be very fun to talk to and work with. The job can be very rewarding if you're willing to put in the work to make it so. That being said, it takes a patient person to work in a restaurant, as you deal with difficult customers and drama in the kitchen from coworkes, almost daily. The schedules are very flexible to work around your life, and the possibility to move to other positions is available."
good,Chili's is a fast paced work environment with a variety of guests. Management was always there to help when needed and encouraged and motivated employees to do the best they could do. I learned how to work in a team and manage time and tasks. The hardest part of the job for me was memorizing the alcohol menu but the most enjoyable part was creating friendships with fellow employees as well as regular guests.
good,"es preparar alimentos, buen ambiente de trabajo, accesibilidad,"
good,"Although some disagreed, I can honestly say I enjoyed working at Chili's. They gave me the opportunity to grow from hostessing, to serving, to bartending, to expo, to key. My favorite things to do were definitely expediting and bartending. I loved expediting because I feel so much satisfaction when everything would run as smoothly as possible with food coming out properly. I believe that as the hostess sets the flow of the restaurant, the expeditor sets the flow of the BOH to the FOH. If your expeditor is having a bad day, the entire restaurant may fall with them. My favorite times were the weekends, I would bring a gift of some sort, gift card, maybe nice bottle of something and would give it to the cook that I felt did the nest job that night. It was great, shifts ran smoothly and everyone was happy. A little money out of my pocket that made for a better day for not only the employees but all of our guests too. "
good,"I love working for Brinker. It is definitely a good company, and if you land in a store with a great general manager, then you will enjoy your time there."
good,"manage the daily operations of a restaurant."
good,I would greet and seat customers when hostessing. Take customers orders and deliver them when ready. Helping other waiters and waitressess. Clearing of tables.
good,"A typical day at work involves constant guest contact, on your feet for up to 7 hours, cleaning, and occasional food handling.  I have learned how to better engage with guests and provide and accommodate for their wants and needs.  My coworkers are very fun and a pleasure to work with.  The hardest part of my job would have to be coordinating wait times on a list with when and where a guest will be seated while also bussing and cleaning tables, and keeping a steady flow of seating guests to keep orders in the kitchen constant but steady, without slamming the kitchen. The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with guests."
good,The managers were genuinely cared about their employees and always treated me with respect. A positive culture is very important to me. They offered me the chance to grow within tge company and always made me feel appreciated.
good,everybody comes in on time with great attitude and ready to work start getting prep done amd making sure all the tables are presentable and ready to be set! i learned how to paste myself in between tables for an example i would take an order and after i’m done i’ll grab drinks for a table that just got sat and let them know i’ll be with them soon. managers was always helpful in every ran food for you in you behind always made sure tables left with an smile. the work culture was very modest everyone always had great attitude toward costumers and always set great examples for guest employees and co workers. the hardest part of working is picking up somebody slack  when trying to do your job as well but tryna keep it in a professional manner. the most enjoyable part of the job was the taste fest when the whole team come together and try out all the different foods that’s new on the menu .
good,"Chilis was my first job and it was amazing. I loved the work environment, the staff, the managers and over all the whole experience. They are tough at first with an intense training but it is worth it. Especially if you are going to be in this field for a long time."
good,"Great food . Great company to work for, they give reasonable duties with decent pay. And as for me. I did just typical cleaning duties and never asked to do anything out of the ordinary"
good,I enjoyed working at chilis i worked there a total of about five years on and off.  I enjoyed the bartending more than i did the key position.  i enjoyed the people more than anything tho but the other Manager were awesome
good,Buensitio para trabajar eselente comunicación muibuenpago me gusto trabajar para ellos   regresaré más adelante
good,My typical day at work would be to come in and get everything organized. Some of my responsibilities included greeting customers kindly and seating them in the correct seat according to the the seat chart. My managers were helpful and were always excited and happy.
good,"great benefits, great quality of life, and great employees. Loved the company and would still be there if there were any closer to where I live now. I miss being there."
good,Having a fun on duty hours with coworkers and mangagement team.I am taking my job seriously but not myself in restaurant.I am serving my experience while m working there.
good,I loved working for these guys. they rock. they treat workers as family as well as all of their guests. it was a great experience when you stay out of the work drama.
good,at chilis i hostess and handled money i gave great cutomer service and speedy at that i took orders and tired my hardest to satisfy customers...had to also clean and so side work..
good,It was a nice day at work when i worked at chili's. it was kind of slow service but the workers were nice. I would work there again because i was comfortable there.
good,"I did not say here long because I got pregnant and I was very sick, but overall I like this job and the environment was very friendly and inviting.  Management was very professional and worked with your schedule.  This was my first serving job, so it showed me a lot about customer service."
good,"A typical day at Chilis would be serving 3-7 parties depending on the day and how busy we are. I serve drinks and food, Take customer orders and make sure customer has an experience."
good,"Unfortunateky closed down, but great culture and superb people and management and fantastic Margaritas"
good,"learned a lot about food service, how to take care of your customers in timely manner. "
good,"I worked part time at Chilis as a waitress. Everyone was truly polite and I enjoyed working with my managers and coworkers. What a great enviornment to work in ! The managers were competent, they offered promotions to the servers who were extra dedicated and they pay minimum server wage.The customers were also helpful by giving me feedback based on my work perfomences. They recommanded me to my mangager so I could receive a raise. The hours were flexible for free time at home."
good,"I usually start the shift rolling silverware."
good,I love being the smiling face you first see when you walk into the resturaunt
good,Terrible managment and communication. Flexible schedule was not A OPTION. didnt care abut there emplyees or personal isue. terribly experience
good,I was at my chili’s location for four years and wasn’t given the opportunity to advance. The managers were manipulative and inconsiderate. The money as a server is great as long as the restaurant is ran correctly and professionally.
good,No comment iv been here 6 years and management is amazing it's like a family at this point I dont plan on leaving but I might be moving soon so have no choice
good,"I got a new manager and didn't like him"
good,"Not the best place to work, but it pays the bills. The customers are terrible and most days, my coworkers are intolerable. But I make enough money to stay so... yeah."
good,"Worked alot of double shifts and tried to be good at what I did. I never did get a chance for advancement. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people and getting to know ""regulars"". "
good,i actually enjoyed working at chilis. i was able to try ad array of jobs while there. i started off as a hostess...which i don't believe is for me. then moved on to rolling silverware. yes that really is the job title. from there i went on to being a QA which means quality assurance. for that all you do is make sure that people food comes out correctly as in how they ordered it.
good,"i worked here for 9 months, they stuck with me threw my anxiety and i became a grate worker and they gave me employee of the month for June. i worked very hard here and the pay was worth it."
good,"I learned every customer is different and always refill, refill, refill. We did not work with management very much only if it was time to review and grade our performance. The co-workers were all very fun and friendly. The hardest part was when we would do such a great job and only get a 5% tip, it was very depressing due to the hourly pay for waitresses in Arizona. The most enjoyable part was working a double shift on the weekends and going home with over 200 hundred dollars."
good,They wanted open availability 24/7 and no oppurtunity to progress in the company nor have two jobs at once. 
good,i enjoyed every moment workin at chillis. the staff was great and so was everything else.
good,"Chilis is a great place to work to make quick money, but management doesnt seem to care for your well being. They excpect you to work while sick and don't have mental health in your best interest."
good,"I would enter the building at 8am read all relevant reports and emails, then I would print out prep schedules and my saftey check and product check. I would temp all the food and then help get the kitchen set up. I would check the employees as they came in then unlocked the doors. After that I ran all operations, handled all invocies, hiring, discipline, and unhappy guests, as well as running the business. "
good,It was a great work environment the part that was hard was doing everyone's job and getting in trouble when someone else's job wasn't done
good,if you love yo get extra money this is the place to be and when i worked there i loved mg coworker and my managers they were very understanding about everything and made sure we succeeed
good,A typical day at Chili's as a hostess is greeting guests and seating them. I would occasionally help services with drink orders if the restaurant was busy and they needed some help. I always was quite the little cleaner and a very hardworker
good,"Providing customers with a good experience, getting them sat at a table as quickly as possible. When it wasn't too busy up front I was usually helping run food out to tables and doing sidework."
good,It was great working there I loved my job but the employees were bullies. If you made a mistake they would say vulgar things over the walkie talkie. Had it not been for a few people I would’ve stayed.
good,Working at Chili’s is a classic corporate structured restaurant group. What you would expect from a outlines job is what you will get.  Structure training and work life
good,Working at Chili's was only temporary for me. I was in school and the restaurant business was great during that time. I enjoyed the people I worked with and the food is great. Still enjoy going to Chili's for dinner!!
good,"From what I learned about working for Chili's in Hawaii, most of it has to do with favoritism, and making yourself stick out from others. Managers will (even if they deny it) have favorites that they give more hours to because those employees work hard in order to deserve it. I was one of them. I first captured my managers attention with my interview and immediately after when I got hired, I was given many hours and shifts that I wanted because they could see that I worked hard and that's the kind of workers they needed to work shifts. If you're not willing to work a sweat, then don't expect to get more hours."
good,Chili's is a company always going though changes. This is not always negative because change can be good but the downfall is when the company is not hearing what team members are reporting what works and what is a fail!
good,I learned how to be more personable from working at Chilis. The workplace was fast pace. It was cool listening to the stories most customers had. The hardest part was dealing with the pace of the job. The most enjoyable part about working at Chilis was the regulars that would come in.
good,"Worked on line. I started working fry cook station, then i was moved to line. I worked saute and grill also. I worked night shift.I had plans on moving up in the company but i started going to school qnd couldnt handle two jobs and school."
good,I like my job. I love the people that I work with. I need a more challenging environment. I want a place that can help me achieve my goals.
good,A typical work day involved clocking in and getting started waiting on my section. I would find out who my partner was for the section and we would start on the tables. I would take orders and bring food. At the end of the day I would work together with my partner to make sure that our section was cleaned and ready for the servers the next day.
good,It was a very tough place to work. You stay very busy and have to follow guidelines when prepping and portioning food for the next day
good,"Management was always involved and helped at all times, co-workers also helped when possible. The hardest part of the job was explaining to the guests why I wasn't able to seat them right away."
good,"the old managers, fun amazing always made work worth the time and never a dull moment there. now the new manager sucks and is too rude, kind of has a little bit a racial issues with him he can be kind of racist."
good,"Just and occasional slow day. Always kidding with the other employee's, but keeping it very professional. Management was ok. Loved meeting people. This was the first place i worked, when i moved to the gulf coast. I learned the people are very nice. At that time i thought cleaning after your shift was the hardest, but i learned a clean establishment is a place where i myself would like to eat."
good,The management I dealt with was terrible they were very ignorant and uncaring about at home matters. The tips you make as a server are good during winter time but summer is terrible.
good,"Fast-paced, high turn over but little room or motivation from managers to move people up in the ranks. Good tips, slow days, busy nights. Management needs to work on communication and follow through. Good coworkers and flexible hours."
good,Great people but the company lacks in many areas. Advancement isn't possible. Raises and compensation are non existent. The management is great but their hands are tied.
good,I loved working with chili’s however it’s not a job for anyone that’s trying to raise a family or be a full time student. They don’t like to work around your schedule. However the money was good on hourly pay and tips. I gave them 4 years of hard work and when I left it was as if they were just “on to the next” employee at my store. But not all are like that.
good,"Great experience and learn a lot from a fast food restaurant, and from costumer service."
good,Everything is great except for the fact that no breaks are ever given even when working straight.  Poor for overall all health and stamina. Not much time for outside life.
good,"A typical day at work would be getting there 10 minutes early and seeing who was working, clocking in, getting a drink to take to my podium and check which sections were available. The management was amazing and very respectful of employees needs. "
good,"Open the bar and complete daily maintenance and procedures. I learned how to wait tables. Management was very helpful when needed.it was very culture. the hardest part of the job was jugging between the bar, tables take out orders, and hostessing. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know people and what they liked."
good,"If only i was making a little more than $2.35 an hour I would have never stopped working here. I also got pregnant and thought I wanted to be a stay at home mom, I was wrong!"
good,I enjoyed working there for almost a year but with the constant changing of management and schedules I found it hard to be stable in my earnings and my job security.
good,"It is a job like any other. Come in be on time and do your job. Breaks were scheduled and so were lunches, coworkers for the most part were easy going."
good,its a cool place to work the people and the managers are very energetic they are very flexible with hours and they always help you when needed
good,"Chili's really is a great place to work for. They let you pretty much make your own schedule, however, unless you work lounge or cocktail, the day shifts don't make you much money. A server's job is really the easiest job, with minimal extra work. The management are all great to work with and it is a very laid back atmosphere."
good,"cleaning, seating customers, help clearing tables, the hardest part of the job was management not listening to employees, not very helpful or sympathetic when it came to employees personal lives"
good,Management was great to work with when you have trips to plan. Co-workers would help you out when you needed shifts to be picked up.
good,This company has a great training and taught me alot on customer service
good,"I loved working in restraunts because you get to meet all kinds of new people, not just the ones you work with, but also the ones you get to take care of and serve their foods and drinks. I loved to get t know almost all my customers. It made it more fun and challenging at the same time."
good,The more work you put into this job the better the outcome. Customer service is the field I belong in and this job makes me feel happy everyday because I get to meet new people and create and experience they wont forget.
good,"A typical day at work is very upbeat, fun and exciting to meet new people everyday. The most enjoyable part of my job is being near my co workers. The hardest part about my job is it gets stressful and overwhelming at times"
good,Management needs to be more flexible and give chances to other to succeed and have a more set schedule of when people get off of work people have other things to do after work
good,Working for Chilis is like working for a big family.  They have reasonable and  flexible hours. They are very family oriented and determined try to make it a great place to work.
good,"If you love to serve you’ll love working at chili’s. The tips are great yet you have to work hard for them due to the fact Chili’s has no bussers, or food runners."
good,"It was stressful at times but I made a lot of friends, and I learned to love serving people. I thought 1 manager was bad but the others were all nice."
good,Fun but busy environment. Can get stressful if fellow team members don't pull their weight and if management doesn't step in to help.  Hardest part was rude guests.
good,"Chilis has good mannagement and is very fast paced, however some of their kitchen staff are questionable. Not all but some, would definitely recommend the workplace to a friend that could mannage quickpaced."
good,No tienen mucha facilidad de manipular la comida y bebida
good,Totalmente una escuela para crecer como profesional
good,Chilis was a fun environment sometimes it was sometimes stressful especially with management. Sometimes management showed favoritism towards others and hours are pretty good.
good,"For the most part, I loved working at Chili's. I started as a host and worked my way up to being a server. The only thing that I really had a problem with was the management. Chili's is a franchise, and so there are regulations for all Chili's that are meant to be followed. Out of 4 managers on our team, each one seemed to interpret those regulations differently. So doing something a certain way that would be totally fine with one manager, would definitely not be okay with another manager. This just caused for a lot of contradiction at work and it could be difficult to stay on everyone's good side. Aside from management, I loved working at Chili's. I loved my other team members, I loved the food, and our team member benefits were pretty decent as well (i.e. discounts, health care benefits). There are problems with management at most jobs. You can't get along with everybody. Overall, I would suggest Chili's to someone looking for a job."
good,"Chilis is a great place to eat as well as work, the management is pretty understanding. The hours are pretty flexible, the tips are great and the atmosphere is great"
good,This would be a good job for someone whose in school or just looking to make some extra cash. A good place to learn how to properly deal with different types of people.
good,"Hard work but great people, great pay, great discounts, love the shirts (uniforms) they give us. Good management. Great system in place. Loved working here."
good,"I am very good at getting along with coworkers. I am great at making friends and I love to meet new people. I follow whats needed of me. At chillis I help clean , rolled silverware, I greeted guests and I also seated them I made sure they where comfortable ."
good,"Start by making sure my section and other things in resteraunt look good. Make sure I have a bank. Put on a smile no matter how my day was outside of the resteraunt. Hardest part of serving would have to be big rushes with long waits, but also it's the best . You make lots of money at that time."
good,"•	Assisted customers and worked as cashier"
good,"Working here was okay the staff was friendly and I remain friends with some of my co-workers, however the management would not help you out as much in other places I have worked, I enjoyed the job itself but not working for this company"
good,Chili's is a great experience for anybody looking for a part time job.
good,"Great upbeat environment, extremely fast paced especially on the weekend. Great company culture, really helps you love the place you work, and feel appreciated."
good,"Soy una chica muy carismática, eficiente en todos los retos que me pone esta carrera, considero que el ser mesera es un gran reto y yo estoy totalmente preparada. Yo siento que nací para ser mesera, esa es mi vocación y pasión, estoy dispuesta a probar nuevos trabajos también"
good,"I learned at Chili’s that no matter your age or race, everyone treated you equally and always made you feel right at home! Also learned a few cooking techniques!"
good,The hours weren't what is hoped for and it took three weeks from my hire date to start which was a little upsetting. It was also very difficult at first because all managers weren't on the same page
good,"Trabajar en Chilis es un poco retante, siempre esta lleno mucho rush, pero en overall se pasa bien se gana bien etc. Tienes siempre que enfocarte en las necesidades de tua clientes."
good,"My typical day of work at Chili's included seating guests, cleaning tables, taking food orders, running food, working on food tickets, and putting food orders together."
good,I enjoyed working there very much however the pay scale was poor for being a hostess and too many side duties without tips the co-writers were all super nice people to work with
good,This is a great place to work. They care about employees and want you to succeed.  They are good about trying to work with your schedule and they are helpful if needed
good,"Made great money "
good,"Absolutely loved the restaurant and my coworkers I love serving I love my guests, but the management is lost in clueless most of the time dirty restaurant"
good,Fellow employees really would make the shifts go smoothly and quickly. Always communicating to help one another if one is struggling. We learned if one person is down then everyone else is.
good,Starting off there are allot to learn . Everyday you learn to do your job better and learn new ways to make things easier to get through the day . Have to serve your customers with the best experience to increase your tips.
good,"I loved my work family at the Brinker International RSC.  Brinker invests in their employees, by offering continuing education seminars, classes at the RSC, mentioning program, and lectures by prominent leaders in the industry."
good,I really enjoyed working there for 12 years. It helped me learn new skills aout cooking being in the kitchen. I would recommend working there at chilis.
good,I’ve met a lot of people and got along with everyone. The guest are kind and are treat well by my co-workers. I enjoyed working there and I think anyone else can the same
good,I worked with chilis for 2 years . Great company and great food . staff works great together and the management is awesome as well . Customers alwaysh leave happy
good,This is a good employer. The most enjoyable part of the job is greeting the customers and seeing new faces every time I work. Everyone on staff is very friendly.
good,"I really enjoyed working there , was going to school at the time so didn’t meet the schedule I was looking for. But overall it was a really good experience there."
good,Es muy buena empresa se preocupa mucho por el bienestar de los empleados y los gerentes q ami me tocaron son mis consistes de tu trabajo muy buena empresa no podré decir nada negativo porq ellos son muy claros en sus objetivos como empresa y sobre todo q vives en chilis 😊👌🏻
good,"The atmosphere is fairly good to work in, the people are nice and kind no matter what position you are in, which is good. A typical day for me wash dishes and clean kitchen area, garbage runs and pick up order request when needed."
good,"Buena comunicación con todos, apoyo en equipo todo los días y un ambiente laborar agradable, horarios flexibles."
good,Hay desarrollo para las personas y se preocupan por el personal que labora ahí.
good,I'm willing to work with you guys so that we can work together as a team what ur involvement is  it also is mine fair to say.i want to be part of the team .
good,"De los mejores trabajos de mesero, excelente ambiente y buenas propinas"
good,"I learned how to operate a dishwasher machine and how to keep everything organized while staying at a fast pace. Also, how to help others with there needs."
good,Wonderful experience.  Great people and environment to work around. The management was always ready and eager to take charge and take care of employees and others needs as soon as they could.
good,Was a host. I feel they had a great system in place for training. Whether you were new or not they put trust in me and let me take control of my position and my abilities
good,The Boss and the Workers are very friendly and they have good service. I've learned to work fast and organized the dishes properly. The hardest part about this job is keeping the restaurant clean thoroughly.
good,"Would greet and seat guests when they came into the restaurant, Used I Pad system to rotate, seat, make reservations, and keep tract of the amount of guests in the restaurant, Take drink orders and ID guests if they wanted an alcoholic beverage, Set up tables and areas for party's, Prepare and assemble guests dishes  and made sure they had everything they ordered, Made sure dishes were presentable, Served food and drinks to guests as needed."
good,Chipotle was my first job . It was a very good life experience of growth and bettering myself for the real world. The Day was usually spent prepping for the next following day . I worked there for a great year of no complaints or challenges that I could not handle .
good,"I love working at chili’s in Silsbee, the mangers are very understanding and extremely helpful. The work environment can get stressful but for the most part it’s fun. "
good,"I have been at Chili's for the past 10 years as a fulltime and partime employee. The management is one of a kind. They work with you on your schedule and are flexible. If you are new to the industry or a veteran or just looking to get out and make a few bucks, Chilis is the best way to go!"
good,I enjoyed Chili's because the managers and staff were great. No issues with management. The job is a decent pace and never to stressful. Everything about the restaurant was awesome
good,"Flexible hours, team atmosphere, friendly co-workers. Daily activities include making sure food goes out correctly, presentable, and in a timely fashion."
good,"I worked at chili’s for a little over a year, and it was a great experience. I learned so much there and it made me grow a lot as a person. everyone there is very supportive and they are very flexible with hours. It’s a great place."
good,"This is a great job to start off at. You learn important business skills such as communication, customer service and dealing with different kinds of people."
good,"When I was there, your co-workers became like your family, as well as the customers.  Had I not had to relocate I would still be there today.  Management is more than understandable at any situation an individual may encounter.  Proud to be a Chilihead."
good,Love my job there really dont have any negatives its a long day but you get to meet lots of people and just learn to run a good shift making sure you are managing labor while handling guests complaints as well as making your team members or employees feel special
good,Stayed at this job for many years. Great management staff. Always was treated fairly by employers and everyone always had a positive attitude. Fun and friendly atmosphere.
good,"Fast paced"
good,"Been working there for almost 6 years."
good,working here is like having a second home you learn to get to know everyone that comes in and they become more like family to you all the servers are awesome
good,I loved working at Chilis. The management team is exceptional and I learned so much in my personal and professional life. I appreciated the professional atmosphere as well.
good,"As most people know the Chili's 3 for $10 hit it big this year with the customers, which is great! But, with the 3 for $10 came a loss of tips for the servers. We went from making nearly $100 a night to some nights barely making $50. As great as management is, we all had to pick up extra shifts in order to make up for the loss of money in our pockets. A co-worker of mine did the math and from 2017-2018 we lost nearly $5,000 in tips because of it."
good,weekend nights are cut throat. be on top of your game and you will make a lot of money. If your not feeling it that day you wont make any money. you have to hustle.
good,Chili's was a very high pace work environment where teamwork and transparent communication were essential for daily success. Many different positions throughout the restaurant came together to make the guests experience satisfying.
good,"Chili's has friendly employers, hard working at what they do, people oriented. It is always fast paced unless it's a slow time of day, some days were better then others."
good,if you know what you are doing they will keep you around for a long time and take really good care of you. Great place to work and amazing food too. good benefits.
good,"todo es bueno en este sitio. su cultura organizacional, la forma en motivar a sus empleados, la enseñanza que se le da a sus colaboradores"
good,"Aprendi a dar mejor servicio al cliente, aprendi a desarrollar mis habilidades de paciencia y tolerancia."
good,Chili's is a good company. They hire and train effectively. There is ample room for advancement for hourly employees. I would consider working there again.
good,Being a hostess was easy. All you did was stand there until a customer walked in and then you had to seat them with menus according to your server order.
good,"Friendly staff and management team.  Nice shopping center where the restaurant is located.  Clean and good food.  Fun environment to be in, would recommend"
good,I had good and bad managers come and go.  It was a fun environment with competitive incentives.  I was there for several years until I finished college
good,"I really enjoyed working here, the management is very good and the managers create a personal relationship. Very fast pasted but flows well. great place to be."
good,This was a great job when I was in college. They worked around my school schedule and allowed me time off during exams. It was a great place to make the money I needed to pay the bills while in school.
good,Definitivamente el mejor ambiente de trabajo. La organización y coordinación era realmente increíble y eficiente. Casi no habia cabida para un error. Los gerentes terminaban siendo parte del equipo de trabajo. Prevalecia el compañerismo y el trabajo en equipo. Nos premiaban por nuestra labor.
good,"Chili's is a great company with amazing community involvement. They help at the food bank around Christmas time and host fun company events like dodgeball tournaments between neighboring locations. Food business requires you be a fast learner, worker and decision maker. You need on point communication skills and customer service to keep up customer experience and productivity with team. If you like serving or working in the food industry and thrive in very very fast paced environments and of course like the extra tips, then try Chili's out!"
good,"Chili's got me set up with a great opportunity. Host trainer wasn't difficult, but the management at the chili's I worked at were unable to get their ship together. Brinker Int had the restaurant running with minimal staff and just expected us to go faster and do more. in the end it became more work for less pay and I was unable to pay my bills and work there. The managers I worked with also allowed guest to be rude and disrespectful to employees. They did not protect us from belligerent guest and in some cases encouraged the continued abuse of their employees. My fellow co-workers did their best to help everyone else out and for the most part I knew I could rely on them more than my managers."
good,"Chili's was my first job that I got out of high school. Waitressing was not the best pay and the tips were not always great, but it worked for me at the time with schooling. They were flexible enough to where I could attend my classes and allowed me to work both morning and afternoon shift to make up for lost days. They did not offer any benefits or good pay which made it hard for me as I become more financially responsible for myself. I was able to bounce around to get more of a paycheck along with tips by working as a hostess, to-go area, and as a server. The people I worked with were great with team work, but we were expected to handle our own tables and be responsible for the customers best experience."
good,Working in chilis I made alot of friends as in coworkers and people who came to eat. It was in the middle of the mall so we were mostly busy especially during christmas time.
good,I would recommend someone work for Chili’s because there are very nice people they are the job is fairly simple it’s easy to catch on it is a fast-paced environment but also very relaxed.
good,I really enjoyed working at here it provided a great working environment the other employees were great team players and the management was welling to work with you without any issues
good,I loved working at chilli's everyone there from management down were great to work with and i would certainly return there if i were ever to mobe back to the new york area!
good,I had a very great time at Chilis and I would recommend that job to anybody. Everybody there is very friendly and the work environment is clean and presentable.
good,"Stop by for Lunch or Dinner! Check out the Restaurant Menu Today."
good,"I really liked working at chillis is ,it was alot to learn, good managers. My coworkers we're very helpful with training and getting stuff done by the book ,so that made life at chillis very less stressful."
good,Chili's is a great company with opportunities to move up and grow within the company. They take care of their employees. They also have a yearly softball event which is tons of fun and great for team-building.
good,"•	Display strong interpersonal communication skills that reflect genuine cultural sensitivities and appreciation."
good,"I loved this job it was great job to get through college. It helped me to understand the adult life to come after college. Management was great the understood as a student, school came first."
good,The overall job at chillis was great the other staff and the managers were very professional and understanding and the training was in-depth and sufficient for the job
good,"I would punch in and wait to be seated my first table"
good,"getting all task accomplished in a timely manner, ive learn to work at a fast pased speed. The greatest part is team work working together. Also chili's is a very compatible job."
good,"Great company to work for. Fast paced. Amazing staff."
good,"Tending to customers is a challenging job that requires a good attitude. Chilli's is a great place to work for and a fun place as well, I highly recommend to anyone that applies.The staff is great to work for and also easy to get along with."
good,this business is great with all ages and difference experience levels. There is competitive pay and easy paths to move up as far as promotions go. I would recommend friends and family to work and/or dine here at this establishment.
good,I love that job cause it was easy and I love the coworkers I was working and the managers helped when I was falling back and they helped anyone that needed help as well.
good,They follow the standards and making sure to give the guest expectation.Making guest feel the number one priority of our store. Because of the teamwork we made everything possible .
good,this a fun friendly fast paced environment.  can get very busy during peak hours and rushes. I have met a lot of fun people working in here. friends i have kept.
good,Learned to better my people skills. Liked working for them until I needed to quit to take care of my Grandparents full time. The Managers tried their best to take care of us when it was needed.
good,I waited tables and it helped me pay my bills. I stayed there long enough to be a bartender and a shift leader for busy shifts. It did what I needed it too.
good,"When I first started working there everyone was nice and helpful and really seemed eager to work everyday they could. However, as I reached 6 months into Chili's the whole demeanor shifted and was more of a miserable place to be at."
good,"working at chili's I made great friendships... made a lot of money... my daily tasks were keeping my area clean at all times... working with a partner... making sure my customers gets everything they need... whether its conversation or what ever they need to accommodate them... I manage  my own money... we were our own cashier... taking orders from guest... so listening and understanding was a huge part of my job... if u dnt listen u could mess things up... which would cost money from u and your job... and we dnt want that... communication is another big parts of the job... you have to be able to communicate back to the BOH to make sure they get what you need out to your customer... overall I enjoyed my job at chili's.. made money, friendships, and new experiences.."
good,the management needs a little work on communication. They also need to be able to train with extra people incase a rush comes in. also they need to have more staff that can do all jobs.
good,Everyone did everything that could to help one another. It was always fun and never a dull moment. Food was great and the management was always there to help with anything.
good,Energetic and fun place to be employed. Never did I dread going to work! Loved the menu and the environment. Much room for advancement if you were willing to put in the time and effort. Would definitely work for this company again.
good,"good company to start working for as you become a first time server, and or host. willing to teach you the rates to become a great leader and worker. also there when people need help in life."
good,"Loved working for this company, and the different friendships I made. Fast paced restaurant, with a fun atmosphere. The food and management are great to work for."
good,Chilis is a great environment to work in because the management focuses a lot on team service and team building skills to teach each employee the value of teamwork.
good,Brinker International is a great company to work for. They provided a wonderful training program and certainly made everyone feel welcome. I was able to learn a great deal with Chilis.
good,Lack of structure made the restaurant very inconsistent no one being held accountable for their mistakes an  the ones that are trying to make things run smoothly being punished
good,"it was a learning experince i always got to meet new people, and i had a chance to make someone happy. there was always team work and i really like working as a team"
good,fast pace environment well staffed with friendly employees learned to work well under high pressure situations. management really cares about all employees
good,"enjoyable atmosphere, management good, too many menu  changes, gotten too casual and too much like a fast food restaurant, training isn't very informative and not long enough, has lost its sit down and enjoy appeal due to the paying out at the table and the speedy lumches"
good,"I really miss them. "
good,I have enjoyed working for Chilis and have grown a lot. They provided an opportunity to meet many new people and experience a vast range of guests. I will always appreciate what they have done for me.
good,I enjoyed working for Chili's. Management was very professional and there were always clear guidelines regarding expectations in the workplace. I would recommend working here.
good,I enjoy working here but would like to work in a different environment. I like the staff and management is top of the line. I think anyone would be happy here.
good,managers are fun and really nice the pay is minimum wage its not worth it because its a lot of work and not well paid we didn't even get tips for hosts and we had to buss tables.
good,I moved up through the ranks from a dishwasher to a Key Team Leader (assistant manager) and really enjoyed working there. The management team was great and so were the customers
good,This is a great place to start a career in the food industry and has given me a lot of knowledge about how restaurants operate. I love the flexibility of the scheduling
good,"As a college student, when I lived at home this was a great way for me to make decent money on nights and weekends when I didn't have class. There wasn't really any days that I would say were typical. I had days where I was super busy and running all over the restaurant trying to assist the other employees and myself as well as customers and there were days where I didn't have a lot of guests so I would try to keep myself busy with extra side-work. The management was very nice, friendly and accommodating. They always listened to me and I very much appreciated that in an employer. I learned a lot about patience with the customers and providing whatever necessary to make sure their experience was a happy one. I also learned about proper communication skills. I became very good at satisfying the needs of others here. The hardest part about the job was the necessity to spread myself out and multitask. This however slowly became second nature and, this skill was heavily developed."
good,"Busy is an understatement when it comes to this business. Even working as a hostess you never stop moving; seating people, running the seating chart, cleaning: tables, chairs, windows, floors and menus. A well run and very busy company."
good,"Es muy divertido trabajar como en familia"
good,"As a hostess , the job isn't very beneficial but if you work your way up you'll find that you joined a great work team. I would recommend being a hostess at 18 then working your way up since you can't be a waitress until age 19."
good,Chilis offers a range of employment opportunities and position with the additional benefit of a flexible schedule. Many locations that you can transfer to.
good,"Working at chilis was a great lesson on responsibility, and it taught me a lot about how to take work seriously, and multitask to get my job done efficiently and on time. It was a good environment to work in and the management was always great and supportive."
good,Working at Chili's is fun and rewarding. The people and management are great. Everyone at work tries to work as a team and help out wherever they can.
good,Chilis in Kerville is a wonderful place to work and has an amazing staff.  I recommend working for this company and culture is top notch
good,This job provided me with a flexible schedule and enough pay to get me through college. I gained a lot of customer service experience and administrative skills.
good,"Good environment. Great staff. They Don't give you enough hours, they promise more than they can handle. Some of the managers are kind of rude."
good,"I worked for Chilis for 3 years. I started as a dishwasher, then bussing, then Food Expo and moved on to doing Togo and became a server, then a trainer."
good,"Managers have always treated my with respect and care."
good,Enjoying greeting customers as they walk and and putting a smile on their face to have a nice bug warm chili's welcoming.
good,"I don't care much for the management and the food isn't really all that great. This company wasn't really flexible with daily life occurrences such as sick days, appointments, other jobs and so on."
good,"Diligent and fast paced atmosphere. Management and staff was exceptional to work with; working together to obtain the same goal; getting the order out in a timely manner, and definitely up to satisfaction"
good,"great company to work for ,very team oriented.management is great they work well with your schedule.quick easy money.steady customers which means steady hours."
good,I enjoy working here because of the strong team environment we have in the store. Everyone on our team is very friendly and always willing to put their own work on hold in order to help out whoever needs it. It makes the job so much easier knowing that everyone from cooks to managers are always willing to lend a hand and work together with you. I love the strong bond and team atmosphere this has created between myself and my co-workers.
good,its a hit or miss on how busy the work day just kinda depends. i learned that time management is key too staying ahead it is very easy too fall behind. everyone is friendly but are mostly in it for themselves.
good,Great place to work I would have stayed with the company but I needed to move to a state where they had no room for me. I worked for the company for 10 years and it really felt like a family there are plenty of advancement opportunities. Chilis invest a lot of time and money to the development of there leaders and team members.
good,This place is awesome. you can take away so many skills by working here. the employees and managers are just great. highly recommend working atleast part time. good money.
good,"I have been with Chili's for the past 10 years and I have grown to love it. I am well respected by my co-workers, management, and guests."

good,It's a great place to work .sometimes it fast pace and somtimes we have down time.Everyone respects each other and has fun when possible.The best part abot it is raising money for ST.Judes
good,I learned how to multi task on other duties besides just one assignment. Very busy family restaurant. Management was great to work for.
good,"Working for Chilis really can be a wonderful thing as long as you work hard, take care of your guests, and respects your teammates, they really do take care of you. They are flexible in trying to help you in every way possible, and try to ""coach"" you into becoming a better worker if you don't feel like you could. It's a place to work unlike other companies that want to help you better yourself and at the same time, grow and advance while furthering your career into what you want to accomplish."
good,"Great place to work if you're team oriented. Some of the best people work there. It was a great place to start, always an oppurtunity to learn something new."
good,This was a fun and interactive work environment.  I think the direction of the company was great and going in the right direction.
good,"Good place to start to work after graduate from HS."
good,"There were no options for full time as a host, maximum hours were 4 hours only unless a shift was picked up."
good,"fast paced work environment taught me a lot about time management. One of the managers was hard to work for but it all went well with every other manager."
good,"Lo mas tipico del trabajo era que el gerente se hacercara a ti y te diera una platica que parecia no tener fin mientras estabas trabajando bajo precion."
good,All staff work together to ensure guest satisfaction. Food is always fresh and the management makes the experience enjoyable by creating incentive for the servers to sell certain items.

good,I enjoyed pretty much all I did there. I felt like as if I was part of a family. It was hard but productive work. I did mostly line cooking but I assisted regularly with prep and dishwashing when need.
good,"As a host, I learned to keep my area clean all the time. I received guests and took them to their seats. As a waitress, my responsibility was to take their orders and give them their food while providing the best time they could have. "
good,Chili's was a great company to work for as well. They had cool charity events and the management was very professional. I hadreally sweet co-workers too.
good,"Chili's is by far my favorite job I have ever had. They are very well organized and professional, but still know how to have fun."

good,its a great place to work. I love to work with the different types of people that work there .All the customers are great also.
good,I have learned great customer and personal skills while working at chills. The fast paced environment is great for learning organizational skills as well.

good,"exciting fast-pace enviroment, meeting new people. Experiencing new oppurtunities within the position given. A opportunity to move along to the next level."
good,My co-workers and management team has been one of the best teams thus far. I met new people everyday and had regulars that would always ask  to be in my section. The hardest part of that job was dealing with disgruntled customers.
good,"I was able to work in a demanding environment here. I had to greet customers and help them get what they needed. As a cook, I handled multiple tickets at once. As a server, I handled multiple tables at once."
good,Wonderful place for me to work when completing undergrad.  Stress free for the most part other than angry customers and easy job.  Loved my coworkers.  The hardest part was dealing with differences in opinions.  And some customers treat you like you're beneath them.
good,love the people that i worked with and the management. everyone was a close family while i worked there and everyone helped each other out when needed to be
good,"Customer Service "
good,Chili's was a place that was amazing to learn to deal with a high volume of work and manage your abilities to work through tough situations.  People that you work with are great and management is generally on your side.  They look out for their team members as a company and host a lot of events for the whole store and for those who are out performing their peers.
good,"I transferred from the Chili's in Rock Hill to the one in Augusta. They were each owned by a different incorporation. The policies were similar, making it easy to start over again."
good,I had to seat people and communicate about our menus and have good customer service. I helped the servers refill drinks and run food as well as clean up after the customers.
good,Working at the Chili's was a wonderful opportunity to work in because it was in my job field.  I enjoy doing customer service and making people smile.
good,This was a great first job. Managers allowed employees to take on more responsiblity as a way to introduce different areas of the company and also to help with store growth. Learned here that I have a leader attitude. I enjoyed training and helping new servers learn the restaurant business and customer service.
good,The management here is wonderful! I loved being here for four years. It was my first job. I wanted to see what else was in store for me in life.
good,"Shifts include fun and interactive people whom have common goals of great customer service and hospitality. It is easy to learn new ways of communicating better among each other, especially in a fast-paced environment. Management really knew how to step in and manage which is something that is much needed to maintain the standards. This allows other co-workers and myself to succeed through the shifts creating a great name for the company."
good,"Chili's is a fun establishment to work at. The people working and coming in are friendly, the job is fast paced and everyone does there part."
good,"I never had a problem with this job, I really enjoyed it. The hardest part of this job would be the customers which are more difficult to deal with when it comes to food. However this never once made me not enjoy it."
good,Working with Chili's Bar and Grill has helped improve customer service skills and working with guests who may obtain a problem. Chili's is fast paced and working alongside great managers and co-workers makes you feel like you're not at work.
good,"Chili's Bar and Grille has many great employees as well as lovely ""regular"" customers. The atmosphere and the people there make the job an enjoyable one. I love being able to put my own spin on my guest's experience as their bartender/server and really personalize my service to each guest. Simple things like remembering a ""regular""'s drink order, or recommending my favorite entree to an indecisive customer make the guest experience great!"
good,I worked at this restaurant for over 3 yrsw from opening in Chruistmas time at Opry Mills Mall . I know how to handle high volumes of clients with a  hr wait. I knew everything about that Restaurant from opening duties side duties and who was do what. I was the Head server her fo0r 2 yrs.
good,3M was a great place to work. A typical day involved operating and maintaining coating and slitting machines. We were also involved in preparing our product for shipment and maintaining and assuring the quality of those products. I learned many things working here. The most important was probably seeing how something that seems very little in a process can have large impacts on the end product if not done correctly. My co-workers were all people I had known most of my life. Our community was very small and everyone there was familiar with each-other. Management was very good there also. They were always available to assist you with any issue you were having. The most challenging part of this job was the constant level of attention that had to be paid to what you were doing.
good,"Working at this particular Chili's in Pine Bluff, AR definitely had its ups and downs, but under the leadership in place during my time there, i couldnt have asked for any better,  The crew really does become a family after those long doubles and coming together to help out a fellow server without hesitation.  This was my first job as a server in a restaurant, and i learned very quickly that it is a complete team effort.  I'd still go back and do anything for my fellow servers that may still be there.  The family and team atmosphere really brought out my leadership qualities that i had forgotten i had.  For that, I am eternally grateful."
good,"Amazing work place, great coworkers and if you love cooking this is the place! great food and nice customers. very fast pased keeps you active and going."
good,"Everyday, come in Prepare food items, Open restaurant, cook food items to order, clean up, check out."
good,"I loved bar tending during the day here, I made really close relationships with my regulars.  They would always close their taps when I was getting ready to leave.  We had a lot of fun and I made sure everyone was smiling or laughing."
good,Brinker (Chili's) is the best company I have ever worked for. They are family oriented and love to have fun while they work. They are excited to help you succeed and grow in the company.
good,I loved working for Chilis. It was a very fast paced serving job and always had something to do. The hardest part of the job is learning the new menus when they come out. The best part of the job is working with people
good,"Company was nice, worked lasted long. Typical work day was easy restaurant work. Co workers were very nice,no hard parts and everything was easy"
good,"typical day was great until it got busy, then it was hectic the hardest part of my job was dealing with management cussing the kitchen out for every little thing"
good,"This job made me who I am today. There the management pushed me to excel in all my life decisions. I couldn't ask for a better management team to work for. Great people, guests were friendly and my co-workers were amazing."
good,"Help manage the kitchen to better the performances "
good,Busy busy busy nights. Coworkers are all one big family who can have too much fun at work. Management could be better but overall great place to work. They do have secret shoppers which can totally ruin your day but if your doing your job right its no problem.
good,"It's a very fast paced environment and at times it could be a bit overwhelming. However, I enjoyed the people I worked with. Overall, I enjoyed working this job."
good,"Chili's is streamlined for you to come in, be able to do your job correctly, make money and go home.  The atmosphere is like a professional family and everyone looks out for the best interest of one another."
good,Business had just got to slow and I wasn't making ends meet. Management and the training team were great! Could have used better wait staff with better attitudes because of what the customers were saying but overall it was a great place to work and have my first dine-in restaurant work experience.
good,A typical day at work was like an everyday job it is a very fun environment to work everyone gets along with each other and the managers were very awesome as well. My co-workers were very friendly and there was never drama in the place. The hardest part of the job was dealing with angry customers whenever there was a wait. The most enjoyable part of the job was everything.
good,got a chance to deal with guests one on one to ensure proper service
good,"Assisted others in carrying out their part of preparing/serving meals"
good,"Love Chili's,  Fajitas are the bomb !"
good,ive experienced a workplace that even under pressure it was fun to work here
good,"At Chili's, I believe I fully began to understand the meaning of a fast paced work environment. Multitasking by taking orders, running food, taking phone take out orders, making drinks behind the bar; all in one serving shift. I also learned the value of teamwork."
good,Un lugar donde aprendi a solucionar mis problemas de manera rapida y trabajar de acuerdo a las necesidades del cliente
good,Great place to work.  Very flexible with scheduling. Wish it had a little more creativity.
good,Typical large chain restaurant. Not sure what else to put than it was a typical service industry job.
good,"Management is very flexible and understanding of any needed scheduling changes."
good,Working for Lancôme cosmetics was a wonderful experience. You are given ample opportunities to grow within the company.
good,"it is very productive working in chili's beacause every day before and after the shift, we are doing shift meeting and all the managers were making sure that we, thier co workers were ready and happy before facing any guests.the hardest part of the job is that we are having a long hour of work considering the time when we will be going home late and then opening the store again early but that is part of the job.what important is i am enjoying my job everyday and i am happy serving them with pleasure."
good,here i learned everything about all the positions in a restaurant

good,I was excited to serve customers with a smile everyday and felt a positive feedback from my customers
good,"Here I learned how to work with all different types of people, handling money, and having to respond quickly to problems. I loved working here and would highly recommend it to anyone."
good,"Everyday at work I greet and seat customers. I also keep my work environment clean by bathroom checks, sweeping, and cleaning windows. I have learned the importance of customer service and teamwork. Th hardest part of my job is making sure the kitchen doesn't get backed up due to over seating. The most enjoyable part of my job is putting a smile on the customer face."
good,"The managers are really helpful, everyone strongly believes in teamwork, and you're always learning new things."
good,"I loved working at Chili's. Everyone was like family. It was always so fun and the management was great. Being involved with all of our guest made the days enjoyable. The only thing about this job was the hours I was getting. Other than that, everything was great."
good,i learned a lot in my work.and all my staff are hardworking person.
good,"Fun Environment. Not your traditional corporate office, very casual dress code."
good,Come in gather everything i needed to begin my shift. Make sure my section was left up to par. Clock in and then get to work. Accompanying the guest as needed and making sure their every need was met promptly.
good,Loved seeing new faces and providing customer service to our customers
good,"A typical day at work consists of customer service and cash handling. I tend to many guests needs to make sure they are satisfied with the company and my service. My coworkers are okay. They are not driven as much as I am. Although I make 2.13 per hour, I still do my best at what I do. The hardest part would be catering to people's needs and not getting anything (15%tips) in return. That is the most bothering part of my job. I would like to add that the most enjoyable part about my job is meeting new people everyday and making them smile. That is what makes my day."
good,"Manage all Messaging, Communications, and Beverage research (both quantitative and qualitative) for the Chili’s Brand."
good,"Chili's is my favorite job that I have ever had. Opening shifts I have to set up everything to get ready for the day so the restaurant could run smoothly. At night when I am closing server I have to make sure everything is put away,the dining room is cleaned, and make sure everything is stocked for the next day. My one girlfriend is who helped me get the job. I started out part time because at the time my daughter was only 5 months old. Most of everyone who works there gets along and hangs out outside of work which makes it enjoyable to work there. The managers are always there to help us out in any possible way. One day I had wrecked my car on my way to work and my one manager drove by and seen it was me and turned around to make sure I was okay and even waited with me and then took me to work. I have learned that you can actually have a job and enjoy being there."
good,I managed all guests orders and made sure service was alway to their expectations. I usually exceeded expectations.
good,"Greet and seat guests as they arrive, keep front of restaurant clean, occasionally bus tables."
good,"Serving is a great, fast money, easy money job. And Chili's is a great place to work for it.  I learned a lot about teamwork and how much more smoothly a shift can run if everyone really works together, and when that happens you get more money in your pocket...everyone comes out winning! Of course the hardest part of the job is when the restaurant gets busy but you just have to push through the rush, and the most enjoyable part is you TRULY have control of your own wages."
good,"A typical day at work would be taking care of customers needs upon request. Working in the service industry you learn to aquire great customer service skills. Management and co-workers are great at Chilis. The hardest part about being a server is that you have to be very fast paced, if not then you will not make money. The most enjoyable part is meeting new people and seeing that your ability to serve them to their standrds not only makes them happy, but it also makes you feel great inside."
good,Was able to interact with all walks of life and provide quality service due the great communication with management.
good,We worked as a great team. We would do pranks on each other when it was slow. It got read of the stress
good,"Waiting tables, cleaning, Bar-backing, food prep, customer service"
good,"I always enjoyed going into work, due to the great management and fellow employees."
good,A typical day at  work was sometimes very slow unless working at night. Managment was very friendly and easy to get along with. The environment with staff and managment was like a family. There was nothing hard about the job at all and the most enjoyable part was making money while enteracting with people.
good,Was always a pleasure to go to work. The atmosphere was motivating and always a go work flow that made high volume a breeze excellent team work from management down. This is a company I would enjoy working for again.
good,This family business managed a small profit at its peak.  Unfortunately although we created a great culture of cooperation it simply did no yield enough revenue to continue operations.
good,Have not worked there or 5+ years - was a good job working with great people.
good,I had a great time working for Chilis. They were always professional and positive.
good,"This job was a fun part time job I held while a student in college. Great work environment, light mood at all times; had to be able to make many tough decisions on the go - definitely helped my time management. Would do again for fun."
good,"I loved working in such a fast-paced and friendly environment, and I always looked forward to going to work.  I think the biggest thing I learned while working at Chili's is that you can always turn a mistake or bad experience around.  It is all about providing the best customer service and making sure that guest leaves happy."
good,"You must be able to multi-task in the food industry, which I am able to do"
good,"I started my employment at Chili's while finishing college and I have to say it was a great job with flexible hours and easy money. I started off as a server and was soon promoted to a bartender. You really have to be team-oriented, friendly, and enjoy interacting with people in general. The atmosphere was great and I loved my managers. I liked forming relationships with guests and other employees. I even thought that I might want to spend my career with the company and try and become a manager. Ultimately, it was a great environment and I loved the job, although stressful at times."
good,"More than ten years of experience cookin in this place, operantin different cook equipment"
good,"Each day consists of greeting, and welcoming the guests to the establishment with a warm, welcoming smile. Taking orders, delivering drinks and food to tables all while building up a relationship with the guests. This was my first job to learn customer service and I believe Chili's did a fine job at teaching me. The management was pretty steady, I was employed for the company for 6 years and we all seemed to get along, same with the co-workers, even though they however weren't as steady. The hardest part of the job is dealing with unhappy customers, but on the other hand, the most enjoyable part was making those unhappy customers happy. Making them have an amazing experience and want to come back to see me. "
good,Working here was great! Working on the weekends was especially fun and the food is amazing. 
good,"My typical day at work was standing at the front desk making sure clients got sat in a timely manner, and answering the phone to take orders. I also was responsible for keeping the facility clean at all times. I loved working with my co-workers. They made the day so much better. The most enjoyable part of my day was getting to be around customers all day, I love working with people and making them happy."
good,i loved this place because it was very fast paced and always new people my coworkers where great but my school and work times conflicted 
good,I learned how to be a better server i really enjoyed working there 
good,It was a fun filled/high pace atmosphere to work in. A typical day consisted of : making prep sheets for the kitchen/prep food/cooked food/ checked food temperature on line so bacteria did not form/ checked in deliveries as well as stored delivered goods/clean bathrooms/wait tables/bartend/bus tables/wash dishes/cashed out registers/bank deposits/cleaned/organized walk in coolers/label/date food. I learned how to work as a team member/learned checks/balances of a business. The management cared about their employees/always willing to lend a hand. The co-workers were hard workers/we were like an extended family. The most difficult part of the job were the hours as I worked all three shifts when shceduled. The most enjoyable part of the job were the staff as we were like family and the regular customers- they became part of our family as well.
good,"Busy, busy, busy..  Good management, majority good co-workers, hardest part?    None of it's hard, maybe stressful at times.  I enjoy everything I do there.  Each title or job has its own quirks."
good,"Great Benefits, great people, only problems I had were resolved since I had stopped working there."
good,"There is a time to be a professional and a time for fun and games. The restaurant business teaches how to separate the two. As the lead host, I lead by example. During busy meal times, I was in-charge of the restaurant; verifying a streamline process from entering the door to finishing the meal."
good,"Fun, high intensity environment. Making customer experience the best I could help with."
good,"I absolutely loved this job. I started there when I was 20, and learned a lot about the restaurant industry including management."
good,It was easy and there was always money to be made. the harder you work the more it paid off.
good,I enjoyed working here and have made a lot of friends. The work is fast-paced and keeps me on my toes.
good,Working at Chili's was an interesting experience overall. It was interesting because I encountered many different kinds of people entering and exiting the restaurant.
good,I loved working with the people that I have worked with. I always enjoyed going into work. A big upside is that I had the chance to meet new people and see them smile and having a strong feeling they will come back again. One downside is that I wanted to work more and the manager said no one will receive overtime.
good,"I was on the opening floor, so I feel that I learned alot about what it takes to open a restaurant."
good,I enjoyed working at chilis. I got to cook food for people who wanted a nice family dinner. Recieving compliments and advice on how to cook the next meal for the next family
good,"always got to meet new people, it was a fast paced environment so I learned how to think fast"
good,"I was 18 years old when I became a ""Chilihead"" and it was the best decision I made. The management team was super fun and informative and made us all feel like family. I had no restaurant experience when I started as a hostess and it wasn't before long that I learned the in's and outs of the business and became head server/bartender. Chili's is a Brinker Corporation, providing the best training, handbook, and benefits one needs to feel secure."
good,"Open store, fill products on line, start greeting and seating guest etc."
good,Management was great as they would work with you if you needed time off. Co-workers were awesome and always very friendly. There was no hard parts to this job. The most enjoyable part was that I got to move up through the ranks as I started off as a busser and eventually worked my way up to being a server.
good,"The job itself was fun yet some of the co-workers were a bit ""uneducated"" in work ethics. Which is often expected. It was a lot of work but needed work for the company to run well. Management was okay,not my favorite. Hardest and most annoying was rolling silverware but it got done."
good,"I truely enjoyed being part of the Chili's team. Since I have moved I have missed not only my fellow employees and the management team, but the patrons as well. Each and every day was something new. We worked very hard to provide the best experience to all of our guests, though most days, it didn't feel like work. I looked forward to my time there, and remember it fondly."
good,fast paces must be on ur feet all day go without breaks and be a happy person the people there r nice thou and it a great work envirorment

good,"Greeted customers as they entered the restaurant and thanked all customers as they exited. Responsible for daily set up of five stations. Communicated with customers regarding orders, comments, and complaints"
good,"greeted, busser, seated guests and explaining our special."
good,"A typical day at work consists of providing great customer service by using communication skills such as interaction and always having a positive attitude, receive payments, use basic math skills, and ensure that the guest is pleased with their meal and experience. The management and co-workers are very easy to talk to and ask for help at any moment. They are very proactive and will do anything to help a team member out. The hardest part of the job is the inconsistent hours and money. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people and ensuring that each person is happy when they exit the establishment."
good,"Enjoyment of customers, positive work environment, great location to meet a diverse group of people"
good,"Working for Chili's was the best. My co-workers were very upbeat, and energenic. A typical day was waiting on people, serving food, making drinks, also assisting other servers with their tables and food. I learned a lot about customer service, how to handle certain situations, how to becoma a quick thinker, and also how to be an independent thinker, to make my own decisons. My co-workers were awesome! The hardest part was the being on your feet all day, and the most enjoyable part was talking to people all day long, I met such amazing people working as a waitress."
good,"Walking in would always make me feel at home, coworkers were great and got to know a lot of good people and build such a great relationship with everyone."
good,I work side by side with other team members as well as management to ensure a great customer service experience.

good,"worked with all people of the restraunt, between waitress, and kitchen crew, cleaned tables, mopped, swept, and threw trash"
good,"• Taking and receiving orders, processing payments and responding appropriately to whatever the customer needs."
good,"A typical day at work required making sure you were dressed properly and making sure that each and every guest felt very comfortable. My managers were great with everything, they went over and beyond for the employees and the guest. The co-workers were the main reason that I didn't want to leave. We all worked great together. The hardest part about the job was the customers, sometimes they can just be a little over whelming. Other then that, I enjoyed everything about the job."
good,"I did enjoy meeting new people from different states,cities, and countries everyday. I learned to move faster counting my money and taking orders. Management wasn't as good as it could've been, but they were doing the best they could. The hardest part of the job was being seven months pregnant, besides that it was wonderful. The most enjoyable part was greeting customers and providing great customer service."
good,Enjoy meeting new people everyday. Management is helpful and caring.
good,This place has its pros and cons. The biggest con would be management. The greatest pro would be the clients that you get everyday.
good,Free lunch
good,Great company to work for and learn excellent foundations.
good,"I am completely satisfied with Chili's. I am just ready to move into more of a ""career"" type of employment."

good,"It got chaotic, extremely busy, and overwhelming, yet everyone worked as a team and was very supportive of each others needs. I was given enough hours to sustain an alright living, and I was treated very fair. We all shared lots of laughs and good times."
good,"Very slow, you do not have to work very hard. Really easy job. Loved working there but had to moved, easy money. Good management. Needs better benefits."
good,"1 :When  play all the team for satisfactions the guests not feedback at shift "
good,Working at chilis is an experience they truly push you to your limits per shift as well as your making good money. They treat you as family at least my location does.
good,The company is great and if you can build regulars then it is very profitable. Amazing bartenders and servers at times and management had its ups and downs but we got through it!
good,"Working at chili’s isn’t much of a tough job but it is like any other job, competitive, stressful, and you have to attend the guests that come in. Sometimes the guests don’t have the best attitude and as a hostess I am in the position of putting any comments to the side and try to give the guests the best experience and service."
good,"Chillis is a very busy, but productive restaurant. The service is nice and the food is great. Most days are busy, but every one works well as a team and the managers are great at leading."
good,"Podría decir que un turno típico en Chili's como mesera (que es mi puesto principial) es practicamente servicio al cliente desde el principio hasta el final. El interactuar con un sin número de personas y servirles ha sido lo que me ha llenado de infinitas experiencias y aprendizaje. Es retante y ha requerido que desarrolle multiples destrezas, pero sin duda alguna me ha creado una muy buena base para emprender en otras areas laborales.  Además, la compañía tiene estandares altos para exigir a sus empleados y esto me ha obligado a siempre dar lo mejor de mí y por lo tanto crecer."
good,"Was easy environment to work in, and management was easy to work with. Good hours, no tips due to being a host but you get something else by working with good people."
good,It was nice working there the employees are very helpful with everything and it helps a lot it’s somewhat of a family and that was one of my favorite jobs
good,A typical day can be busy. I moved up from hostess to server to mid manager to corporate trainer.  I learned how to train new employees. Management could have been a little better as far as communication skills with employees. The hardest part of the job was when there was no communication and you were expected to push out certain numbers when it was made impossible. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people and the guest that I got to meet everyday. The company itself felt like family.
good,"I loved being a ChiliHead. Fun place to work, we did family parties for the staff on holidays. I loved it. Management seemed to really care and money was good."
good,This opportunity has long hours and is difficult to balance my life. The work environment is great you work with great people and help you to grow in your productivity. And relating to other co-workers.
good,"I love the job just looking for a better career ,  great management, great customers great co workers everything’s good . Pay rate just not liable and not good benefits."
good,"It was nice and a good place but not really for me, as I only had gotten 2 hours each day if that, and I went home when they didn't need me and if it was slow they would send me home."
good,"Chili's is a fun, fast-paced, wonderful place to work as a server.  It taught me life long customer service skills that have helped in my pursuit of a career."
good,It is a normal corporate ran store. Just like all the others. It’s a fast paced restaurant and they want a huge turn over. Great food if cooked right.
good,"Gave me hours I needed and friendly staff!"
good,Es una empresa con bastantes fallos económicos pero muy buena para trabajar se trabaja de 8 horas más horas extras
good,Great community and experience. The managers were involved and gave hours based on productivity. Highly recommend to someone looking for something flexible.
good,"I very much enjoy working for this company. Co workers get along great and the management team is amazing. While there is not much room to grow, it is a very flexible job and great for a single mother, like myself."
good,Going in I knew I would be working here for a limited time due to moving back home to help with family. I ended up staying for 2 years and it was great. They appreciate their employees and really work with them on schedules.
good,"I would work in shouk shark (sharq)"
good,"Hours could be long as well as ambiguous. A day at work was set for you to come in at a certain time, but there was never a direct time you would leave. I learned how it is to work in customer service and food which is not as easy as it seems. I would greet guests, following a seating rotation and sign them to a space, and when waitressing I would hand out silverware, take orders and run food out."
good,"My overall experience with chilis was ok. Politics and favoritism played a huge role in the restraunt and that is why I quit my job. The management is very strict which I believe is a good thing, and there is a potential for internal growth."
good,"hosting, taking names, giving waiting times, seating customers, taking drink orders and food orders, serving drinks, and food to customers, keeping drinks filled, entering orders into the computer system, giving customers the check, receiving payment, caring around credit slips and large amount of money the whole shift, turning in money and paying out for the buss boy and the bartender and reporting tips at the end of the night upon checking out"
good,It was a good job waiting tables. The only downside was the overall diminishing of the quality of the product I served. Chili's used to be a cut above and now it is average.
good,"If you are Racist, sexist and a homophobic person you and this GM will get alone fine.  If your normal keep looking for other job offers.  Chilis as a whole is a great company but this location has a leadership issue"
good,I really enjoyed working for this company. The benefits were pretty decent. What made my time there the most enjoyable were my co-workers and management.
good,"I loved cooking there and I took a lot of knowledge with me , but the managers and shift leaders were always so mixed up. They would always be switching up schedules."
good,Cooking at high volumes at a really fast. Great people to work with. I learned to cook very well and to be able to multitask. Management is great and very understanding. The hardest part of the job is being able to keep up with the food orders. The most enjoyable part is being around a team of people who work just as hard as I do and are still able to maintain a great attitude.
good,Stay on top of your sales and customer service skills. Your managers have your back so be sure to work up to those standards.
good,"I have had many ups and downs with this company. Overall, I would rate the company decently. However, at times the most hard working people are looked over and taken for granted."
good,"hardest part of the job was learning the computers because menu on computer doesn't show actual words, just nicknames for the food. my co-worker that i usually worked with in the to-go area is my best friend so it was a fun day."
good,"management awesome, great work environment. Co workers were great. learned a lot from working here. if for any reason I had to go back I gladly would."
good,Increased service quality by efficiently expediting food items to guests. Supported corporate openings of new stores.
good,fun work place with relatively supportive management. always running getting food and drinks out to make sure our valued customers have the best experience they can have.
good,"Chili's is a restaurant that continually stays on a path of new and exciting technological advancements for the industry. They were the first to offer the Kiosk systems for every table, you can order drinks, appetizers, or dessert without your server being present, you can print your check ,pay your bill, and leave a review on how the server represented Chili's. Games for children, current game coverage, and daily news from many different sources are also available on the Kiosk. The restaurant needs some work, however, overall it is one of my favorite jobs I ever had."
good,Serving is a fun and easy way to make a lot of money. It is an enjoyable environment with ample opportunity to interact with people. Provides great experience with customer service.
good,As a restaurant manager hours are not 55 a week it is more like 70 a week. Each restaurant has things that have to be done before you leave that shift and if it is busy you are not getting done what you have to so you are there longer.
good,I had the best time working for this company. I learned how to work well in a team environment and the managers were always amazing.
good,"Very day to day business, very professional, always had to be aware of your numbers for business point of view. If something occured that was not part of planned day need to correct immediatley."
good,"Great job for any college kid or as a second job. Hours are flexible, Co-workers are usually cool, if it wasn't for the guests this job wold be awesome"
good,The people I worked with were great.. although always 1 bad apple in the bunch. The managers kept consistent never showed favoritism and helped out employees on the line when necessary. Just don't show up for work late or call in if you know you are going to be.
good,Good place to work management was good but there were some awful ones like any where and if you ike to get up early go in and get out in closeing time this is the palce you wanna work 
good,"The people I work with are like family. Work is fun most of the time. We work hard, but the money is worth it."
good,i would not advise working on the weekend there is no down time at all barely time to stock up in between waves it is a mad house Thursday through Sunday other than that it was fun to be around in the down time and closing
good,"Greeting new costumers. Delegating tasks, Food prep, Bartender, Cleaning"
good,Assisted with food and beverage orders
good,Loved the people I worked with. Helping the military get into shape and stay in shape was very rewarding.
good,"My current line of work requires me everyday to interact with all types of people and personalities which allows me to put in practice care and attention the a patient may require under my care. Also the costumer service industry teaches me everyday how to act and interact with a guess when a problem arise, problem solving is paramount in this industry in order to create a clientele base and repeat and happy costumers."
good,My time at Chili's has been underlined by hard work with a fast paced environment. I have excelled in customer service and product sales. I have also advanced in the company through hard work and leading by example. My co workers are aware of my dedication to working hard as well as being able to relate on a personal level. The most enjoyable part of the job is the personal and sociable interaction with co workers and customers
good,Pretty good job. They have split shifts so you can work doubles. They are very fair when it comes to scheduling. They have good benefits and tuition reimbursement.
good,My first at Chilis it was okay i was scared because it was my first day and i didn't want to get anyone order wrong i did get a few wrong but but as the night went on i got a hang of things.
good,"Chili's has been a great place to work and catch up with my cooking skills, but the commute has become a bit difficult due to changes with the work schedule."
good,It is a really good job to work for but only temporary unless you want fight for raises and promotion over years. I want more than to be just a fast food service person but it is a good stead laid back job
good,If you want to make good money you have to be willing to work hours evenings and weekends. Money can be good if you are good at serving. They are also all about promoting from within rather than hiring from outside.
good,"Being a host at Chili’s have taught me to face my fear with communicating with guests, I use to have a problem with communicating and now that I’m a server at Golden Corral communicating is a piece of cake for me."
good,this is a fast paced environment. non professional. very laid back. a good job to go to and come home and forget about. the only downside is the pay is not great and there is a lot of manual labor. carrying trays is heavy and taxing on your body.
good,I thoroughly enjoyed my time at chili's and would recommend anyone who's interested to work there. Management has always been nice and fair. Pay rate is quite fair and the work atmosphere is very pleasant.
good,Chili’s is a great company to work for. They are helpful in times of need. Sometimes getting the attention of management can be a struggle. Schedule errors are frequent.
good,Even though I was only an hostess the customers were well mannered and my job was fairly easy. The only issue would have to be the other coworkers not being understanding
good,They were discriminatory and aggressive in favoritism. They valued work ethic last and popularity most important when considering advancement. Co-workers were awesome and so is the corporation. It is unfortunate the treatment employees receive at this location.
good,I loved working for chili's. It was a nice and fun environment however I did not get as many hours a week as I would have liked. Other than that if I got the hours I wanted then I would have stayed.
good,"I enjoyed my time at the chili's of Athens. I cooked, I washed dishes, I made too many jokes and all in all the company is very welcoming to those that are willing to work hard"
good,"Overall, it was a nice place to work at. It was fast paced but not stressful. The coworkers had bad attitudes, but you'll understand by being in the work place."
good,"Management is excellent, friendly atmosphere, hard work but fair hours are given. Servers have to be customer service savvy and able to work with all types of people. Must have certifications in safe service and the ability to serve alcohol."
good,good place to work but the money was not enough and other companys offered more money that was the only reson i left. they need to pay more to be compet with other companies
good,loved the job but the general manager was horrible to work for and never put my transfer in when i had to relocate and i had to quit. but the company itself is good place to work for.
good,I have had many jobs in my time and this place is by far the best... The people the food...everything. Everyone is respectful and fun to work woyh. As long as you do your basic job there are no issues.
good,"It is nice work experience,  not a difficult job or work space. Once you get the hang of it, it becomes almost second nature. "
good,"We all worked together as a unit. There were never any problems or miscommunication. "
good,I enjoyed working with Chilis years ago. If you can accomplish your tasks and do what you are assigned this job is a great way to earn money. Everyone pulled their weight.
good,"Managers are always on point and eager to get productive work going."
good,Working at Chili's was a great experience and I learned a lot from it being my first job. I learned how to work in a team of people that I didn't necessarily know outside of work and learned to do all types of jobs.
good,"a typical day at work , would be coming in getting your self ready for the day , make sure you stock yourself up for a successful shift , I've learned to deal with all type of people , with in my 6 years working for the same chilis , i have surpassed a lot of managers mostly all of them were GREAT , the hardest part of my job is making sure everything gets out to your tables with in the expected time with no issues . the most enjoyable part of my job would be interacting with your guest ."
good,everyone was fun and energetic most people would come in and very fast paced during rush hours and holidays  pay was ok benefits was ok as well got half off while working and 25 discount while off clock
good,"Most enjoyable part of the job is being front of house and getting to greet people with a smile.  First impression is everything, and i love being the happy face they see.  The culture is fun and the people i work with are very nice.  It's a great place to work with a team and work together."
good,"Management was not professional at all. But the employees were amazing. I wouldn't  have lasted that long if it wasn't  for them. Overall Chilies is a great company to work for. I'm even thinking about going back, but to a different location."
good,I loved chilis as a company and fully supported what they believed in. I did not love my manager. She was very hard to work with and did not like me. I had to find another job.
good,"Amazing place to work, couldn’t schedule work between school at the time. Westbury was a high paced restaraunt and it wa me great money, and I really enjoyed the people I worked with"
good,"not helpful staff at all. teamwork wasn't applied there at all. the managers would ignore guests issues, it was a fast paced place, and i enjoy that, a lot"
good,"I loved my fellow co-workers. However, this Chili's was poorly managed and the quality of the food (especially the presentation), has decreased over the years."
good,I work at Chili's from the very start a position of server all the way up into lower management and I would recommend it for anybody who is looking to really find the leader in them and anybody who likes a fast-paced fun and constantly changing environment
good,"I loved working here.  The pay wasn't that great, but only because people aren't great at tipping, but the atmosphere was pleasant. I would definitely recommend working here."
good,I enjoyed working here because there was always work and I enjoy serving people. I also like working with food and I took pride in my customer service.
good,Great place to work lots of fun lots of people and lots of experience. Not enough help tho need more people to work hard and what they love to do. Good place
good,Working at Chili's was definitely a fun environment. When things got busy your fellow Chiliheads always would lend a hand. Managers were also very helpful in a busy rush.
good,it was phenomenal working here. everyone got along and everyone had fun during work. we used to be busy but unfortuantly it has been shut down in toronto ontario due to nature.
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed working for chilis. They do many fundraisers to help good causes throughout the year and treat their employees very well. Most importantly, they are very good about working with your availability."
good,"As a host you are the first that everyone sees. you have to make sure you are smiling and greet everyone. Lunch are typically the busiest time. you have to make sure the restrooms are clean, your host stand is clean."
good,"Enjoyed working with other co-workers, learning different ways to consolidate allowing me to attend tables fast and smoothly. Management was flexible with my hours when I was in school. Working with company I realized they truly cared for their customers, trying to be convenient to both to staff and customers. Hardest part of the job was dealing with others negativity such as customers and staff but it taught me how to handle and resolve a situation. Enjoying the social time with my customers and busy pasted work environment, being able to lend a helping hand to others when needed."
good,"People here are all friendly, even the waitresses respect the cooks.  Okay pay, almost free meals, very kind management"
good,Working at Chili's for 10 years has its ups and downs. The pay isn't that great but the managers are cool. Everyday is a challenge working there because some days we are slow and some days we are busy.
good,Was ok. I got to see everything change because i was with HMS host for so long. It was better back then than it is now. A lot has changed since then..
good,A very busy start from the moment you come to work. High volume customer service. Very fast paced. Great co workers at times but also some not so great. Hardest part of the job was dealing with complicated customers. I enjoyed the money I was able to make.
good,"It was a great way to learn how to multi-task and work under pressure. It also helped me into a team player. It forces you to be organized, be patient and flexible, characteristics that will help in future jobs."
good,I enjoyed working for chili's! This location had the best manager I have ever worked for. Here they truly do care for their employees.
good,I loved serving here but the employees were very clique-ish and it was hard to fit in. I was in a serious car accident and i lost my job due to needing extra time off because of my injuries. The management could be hard to communicate with.
good,A normal day at work would be prepping food for the entire work shift. Serving our guest with great customer service and making sure they would always come back for their next visit. I have learned to work at a very fast paced business and multi-task. Management was very good at helping us keep up with our guests and always made sure shifts were calm and never too unorganized. Co-workers were very nice I was a head server at Chili's so everyone who was hired I trained for the workplace. The hardest part of this job was having to leave because it doesn't pay me enough for my lifestyle. I love to work there with humble people and the festivities was very fun. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting our guests it was like having a third family at work.
good,El ambiente laboral y la cultura organizacional que se vivía permitía que uno no pensara en que estaba laborando. Tienen una manera de organizar todo de tal manera que no puede haber fallas en la operación pero de esto no te das cuenta como trabajador. Se te permite trabajar con alegria y la integración del equipo es muy solida.
good,Chilis is a wonderful place to work it helped me with my customer service skills being able to interact with the guests as they share their experiences.  Management in chili's need to be more responsible.
good,"A typical day at chili's is like your first day at school. At the end of the day you learned new food and meet new people everyday. The management team is great, they treat the co-workers like family and the hardest part of the job is working under pressure when it gets crowed and the most enjoyable part of the job is that i love it."
good,The work here was very fast paced and fun. I liked that about this job. I was always busy and had something to do. I had the opportunity to grow with the company which is also something I liked. The managers were very flexible with needs and professional.
good,"Working for Chili's is far from the typical job. Everyday was exciting for me because there was always a new adventure awaiting. I met colorful people everyday as it was a great source for networking. I learned that sometimes people need a safe haven, a home away from home, and engaging with them is all that they need sometimes. People will visit a casino just to see their favorite employee! The culture inside of a casino is like no other. The employees are from all different walks of life and make the workplace that much more interesting! I have yet to meet a coworker that I could not relate to, learn from, or enjoy a conversation with."
good,"Fast pace restaurant. I always walked in happy to go to work because I knew my coworkers were always happy to work. There were so many workers there, so everyday I always worked with someone different. Teamwork was emphasized here, so we always helped each other out. The managers were always willing to help us out during rushes that we had,"
good,"Chili's is a really good place to work. Its fun, the managers are great, and the pay is ""ok"" sometimes. Its fast paced so time goes by pretty quick."
good,I loved working there.  My coworkers were awesome but the management staff could of used a little more training in the interaction with employees.  It was definitely not an equal opportunity environment at the location I was at.  There was a lot of Favoritetism going on there.  But as for the Company I loved it.  All the perks and benefits and company activities were the best.
good,"a typical work day involved serving large amounts of customers a day, with hectic hours, and fun co workers. I learned how to perfect my skills as a server and how to be professional and friendly at the same time. my co workers were friendly and helpful. the hardest part of the job was managing rude or unruly customers. while the most enjoyable part was getting to talk to new people everyday."
good,"Fast paced work enviroment"
good,Good place to work. Flexible schedule. I enjoy meeting new people and learning new techniques. I have learned valuable social skills.
good,Chili's has been my staple job from high school all the way through college. I have done almost every job position available at chili's. Right now I am a food server and only pick up shifts as needed. This job has provided excellent pay and a fun work environment. The restaurant business is where my customer service skills were born and refined. I interact with many different types of people and creating connections with them is how I provide great service. I help provide a relaxed environment for guests and take great care of them.
good,"I love working there .Everyone is so friendly.I just love the atmosphere , the benifits.The workers are great.Working as a family."
good,"It is a nice job if you are student. This job alone didn't pay all the bills but it was nice I was comfortable in the area that I was in and made a decent pay. I liked that I was able to come in and do my work and go home, but the money was not that great and there wasn't many hours. Other than that it was ok."
good,Absolutely loved their company even with their flaws because I knew there was always room to grow and to make the flaws into perfection for that company. I started off from hosting and worked my way up to become a trainer in every area. I loved being able to grow with this company and they always worked with my schedule for my children no matter the circumstances.
good,"great place to work, great management, easy schedules and fast paced environment"
good,"Un día normal de trabajo era llegar recibir tu area que una semana antes ya sabias cual te tocaba y empezar a atender a la gente. Aprendí sobre comida algunas cosillas, sobre higiene en la comida y en nuestra persona a la hora de atender a los comensales, sobre los tiempos que debe tardar en servirse una mesa. Los compañeros de trabajo muy accesibles si uno de repente necesitaba cambiar un horario, todos dispuestos a enseñar lo que ya sabían en cuestión del trabajo y más que nada todos eramos un equipo. Lo más díficil del trabajo que el menú era en inglés español, en la pc para mandar la orden de comida a la cocina venía diferente modo y la capacitación fue diferente a éstas dos antes mencionadas."
good,Proudly serving very difficult person in the world fun workplace working as a one team can work underpressure
good,"High paced and fun place to work. One should have lots of energy when running a bar, waiting tables and making guest feel at home. If you can do that. Anyone can make good money. I loved the great discount on Chili's food, mmmmmm. The insurance is not so good. Even if you are full time. Better coverage is avalable for upper management. Chili's Bar & Grill is a great place to work and a better place to eat, drink and hang out."
good,"A typical day at work consists of starting inventory, managing money, helping and communicating customer service in person and on phone."
good,A great place tro work for and make money while in school
good,"Best experience there I would re do it if I could , taking time from work was not a regret and I leaned so much from the job setting ,Chillis love there employees"
good,"Lo malo eran los cierres, ya que puede salir muy tarde y no pagan las horas extras."
good,"movido en la tarde."
good,Lots of teamwork & people to help you out. Management is always there to guide you & help you with anything you need. The whole team really comes together to guide each other in which direction we need to meet our goals
good,"Hours are not secured for any employee  this is a set back for the employees. Overall it is a good company, just managment needs to be more efficient and organized"
good,Chili’s is a good place to get your first job or just something you would like to do to bring in some money so you can have some type of income and getting to know other people.
good,"I have worked for Chili's for 7+ years now. I usually tell people that Chili's has taken care of me over the years, so I've taken care of them. I've been blessed with caring and flexible management over the years. I don't know if this can be said for all stores, but I know my management genuinely cares for their staff and that is a great quality for superiors."
good,I really enjoy working here and I look forward to furthering my career there. The managers are very understanding and try to make you as comfortable as possible.
good,"Fue un trabajo interesante, me enseñó a tratar con personas y a tener empatía. Muchos días eran trabajo bajo presión debido a la demanda, pero me enseñó a organizarme para obtener buenos resultados."
good,You become family with everyone that works there. A great place to learn customer service. I love working there and I love how everyone helps each other out.
good,"Good place to begin as a server. Not too complicated. Menu is really detailed. You can run the whole gammet of casual dining places, but it is fun to be a Chili head."
good,energetic environment. Very fast paced. Love customer services and giving people a reason to smile. The hardest part was being the hours and not knowing how much money I was going to make.
good,The Chili's I worked for was part of a franchise company that tried to extract every cent of profit they could out of the business.  Cut corners with staffing the kitchen to save money and overstaffed the front of house by paying hosts and bussers far less than minimum wage and having servers make up for it with a high tip out.  Money wasn't great
good,"Awesome place to work "
good,"I've learned a lot during my stay the company, because i consider my every day duty as a challenge, like how to handle critical situation and different types of guests."
good,"Great company to work for, very high paced. Upper management really cares about the wellbeing of the guest’s that come through the doors. Money is great."
good,I enjoyed my job m. One of the hardest parts was dealing with rude customers. I enjoyed that everyone worked as a team. The hours were very flexible and I enjoyed working with all of the people there
good,I loved working for Chilis. Upper management seemed to promote candidates to general manager positions that were not qualified to do the job. I ended up doing most of my bosses work most of the time.
good,"Typical Day: long, busy, face paced.  Taking orders, boxing them up.  Checking guests out, answering phone calls. "
good,Very Clean Fast Learning Environment Well Traied Management Incredible Food Service Outstanding Servers Also To Go Curbe Side Is Extremely On Point 5 Star Restaurant
good,"There were times when big parties would come in and things would get really hectic especially when you had a wait list and was quoting a party of (2) 30-45 minutes, but overall the environment was friendly and fun as long as you keep a smile on your face everything will be good."
good,Truthfully I’ve loved working for Chilis. I have been fortunate enough to build a friendship on top of working partners while at Chilis. With my husband being in the military and Home visitors sometimes seem to be on moments notice the managers always found ways to cover my shifts to allow me to see him. Chilis has also been able to travel with me as the army moved us around. I’m beyond thankful
good,The former managers and current managers at the man Teaka chilies were amazing to work for. They were always very courteous and very excepting of whatever issues you were having if you needed to switch his schedule or work half and then come back and work half later in the day they were completely flexible with it they were all extremely extremely personable and always wanted you to do the best and they always at their best for you
good,Each waiter and manager are very friendly and understanding if you encounter those bad attitude guests that for whatever reason think they are any more superior than you because they are out eating food instead of Mcdonald's. Each waiter is there to earn money and it is very difficult to do in these times where some people don't want to tip for a meal. I was a busser/host and I never got a tip but if the waiter had a good day they would occasionally throw you a bone.
good,Everyday is different you do not know if you will be super busy or slow but you work in a close team environment so everyone is willing to help out if you need it.
good,Very fast paced and fun place to work it a great place to be employed excellent tips customers are so friendly and great to be around. I enjoy working there
good,"Very fun place to work with an awesome culture. When I worked for them, they treated us managers and the staff very well. The hours were long but they compensated with team building events and trips for salaried employees. The only issue I had was you could never settle in because they would transfer managers without notice"
good,It was a nice place environment and the staff was nice. The good and enjoyable part of the work was when my managers can see the hard work and effort I put in the job
good,"I started at Chilis when I was in high school. It was a great first job to have because it taught me customer service, how to stay calm in fast paced environments, and time management."
good,"Working here is pretty good. There is room for growing in the company.  All of the coworkers get along pretty well for the most part, there is the occasional drama that comes with every work place. The managers here are very good about working around schedules."
good,I worked happily at Chili's for 3 months before they closed their doors. I enjoyed every shift and the management was always kind and reliable. I would love to work for them again!
good,"Over all chili's is a great to place work, make friends, and enjoying being yourself. you never no what the may bring. on average a day working at chili's greeting the guest as they walk in and taking care of them while there in the building."
good,"Great people and awesome work enviornment, would definitely recommend. Whenever I had a personal emergency, management would cover for me and were always very understanding."
good,"Checking in with a manager before going on the floor, getting assigned to a station, checking my tables preparing for shift, wait tables, doing running side work, being a team player, running out all hot food asap(even if its not mine) closing side work ,ect."
good,Good start for a job nice area of location happy place also very centralized buidling not far from houses .........................................   .
good,great food and management. fast pased enviroment with potental to make a lot of money. to many servers employeed leaved short hours but shifts you do work you can make really good tips.
good,Steady workdays hard working employees. the managers are awsome honest caring people everyone works together to ensure that the customers enjoy there experience
good,"It was a extremely fast paced work enviroment with many responsibilities, saying that I really loved it and hated having to give that job up. I am hoping to get a rehire in the location I am at now."
good,I was there for over 8 years. felt like a family. at other locations some management favored other employees more than others. I love bartending and making guests feel good.
good,"My typical day at work consisted of taking food orders, cash handling, bussing, customer service, cleaning duties. The hardest part of the job was when it got very busy that it then became easy to make small mistakes. Most enjoyable part of the job was the amazing tips."
good,aim high for salary.They treated me with respect and were awesome with my family priorities. Had to leave because of advancement. I didn't feel I would have been able to move up.
good,"As long as you have an Outgoing attitude, assertive, passionate, awesome personality then Chilis is the place for you. Customers are great to talk with & get to know. Management is unbelievably awesome, above all I love the crew at Chilis."
good,Loved the people I worked with. I have been there for 10 years so it was my second family. Very relaxed and flexible schedule. Easy to work around a school schedule.
good,Chilis was a great experience. It helped improve my customer skills & my ability to work under pressure. There is also no other job where I had seen team work so evidently in every shift.
good,"Excelente trabajo, aprendes mucho de la cultura del orden y de su metodología de trabajo"
good,Working at chilis kept me on my feet. It had me moving every minute and not just sitting around. You have to tend to multiple guest at once and keep them satisfied.  I learned a lot of problem solving and multi tasking which just furthered enhanced my skills in the customer service industry.
good,"I am currently a hostess here and it's a lot of fun for the most part. The staff is usually really great to work with, and though the managers aren't always the best its still a really great place to work at."
good,"Would work here again! Fun, easy, quick. It was easy money. Made more than anticipated. Good food and drinks. Free food during training. Cash to take home daily"
good,Fun employees but the management needed work. Needed to keep stocked on our food and supplies. Try and motivate the workers and make it a good work environment that you want to come too.
good,"A typical day at work on a normal day is full of serving all my guest, about 20 different tables on a good night. Using good customer service and REAL team work, because we have a partner ( or two people per section.. It has really helped me learn to work with others and ask for help when its needed. Although, I would also say this is the hardest part of my job, having a partner.. I feel like I could be making more sometimes or even though, yes it is helpful sometimes and has good tactics, it also allows some people to fall back and be lazy. I feel like everyone should be watched and judged based upon THEMSELVES and THEIR work."
good,"Very busy , always on my feet at a typical day of work , great atmosphere and ability to transfer because there are so many Chilis across the states. And you receive a 50 % discount on your food for being an employee."
good,"I worked at Chili's for almost 5 years and it was one of the best places I've ever been employed at! It was a great, positive environment where I knew I could count on people to help me if I ever needed it!"
good,I've worked at Chili's for nine years. It had became the means for supporting myself and my children.  The company is great for compensation and you get what you put in. There really isn't an easy way to Work your way up when you are starting a family.
good,Its what you make it. When you go in with a positive attitude and work hard you and make our guest confterbule and happy you will have a great day.
good,They treat you like family . They make sure your taken care of no matter what you go through .. if you ever have a problem the managers are really understanding and will help anyway they can.
good,I've worked there awhile. it's like a huge family. I had some of the best managers you could ask for. The staff is excellent. Pay isn't great but not many places pay well.
good,"As a bartender and a waiter, a person gets the opportunity to really gets to know the customer. Working under stress becomes a part of you. I can say this was one of the best experiences as a young man."
good,"I liked being a part of a strong team and culture.  A business, especially a large business, is doomed to fail without strong cultural values and listen to team member contributions.  Chilis  did both."
good,"i love working here, fun environment. good coworkers. always busy. helpful team members. easy to work with managers, that will work with your schdule"
good,"A typical day at work was opening the bar and setting everyone else up for the whole day. We set the tone and got everything done. I learned a lot about interacting with customers while balancing efficient work with good service. My store manager and kitchen manager were always dependable and willing to listen to our feedback. We had a lot of turnover with the bar managers but I learned a lot from each of them. My coworkers were strong servers and bartenders all willing to help out and work as a team. The hardest part of the job was holding down the entire left side of the restaurant (running the bar, lounge and to go) but my coworkers and managers always helped and got me through it which was most enjoyable to me."
good,Very good they have great service and ole time people friendly staff. A day at work though its very unclean to be in the garbage area. The hardest part of the job is taking a break and the most enjoyable part is the service.
good,"Like any food service job, it's great for quick money, but it's not something you want to make a career out of. I love my co-workers, staff, management, and guests. Great atmosphere."
good,"I loved working at this establishment, I love people and upbeat fast paced work place. I think I am very outgoing and a problem solver."
good,"I worked at Chilis for almost seven years and it was the best experience i could ever ask for. It was the best because every day was different and you got to work with all walks of life. The management varied depending on who was scheduled to work. There were some managers who were very relaxed and helpful, than there where other managers who stayed in the off the whole time and never helped."
good,"Opened/Closed restaurant, Served customers in a 7-table section, took and delivered orders and refilled drinks, Assisted customers with menu, received and processed payments, Maintained a clean section ready for new customers at all times, Ensured all food items were filled and restocked"
good,"I enjoyed working here. I liked the fast paced atmosphere, being a part of a team, and the people. I learned to better manage my time and multitask during peak business hours. The first thing I would do when I got to work was look over my station and make sure it was stocked, than the dinner rush would come, and than I would brgin to close my station, restock, and prep."
good,"it a great place to learn the inside of the restaurant industry, also the environment is fun, safe and very enjoyable. flexible work hours and extremely fair wages."
good,"Providing excellent customer service through fast and attentive service while creating a personal connection with the guest. It is good money most of the time, it depends on who comes in."
good,Waitressing at Chilis has helped me develop many problem solving skills and the ability to multitask in everyday life. The management has many goals to meet and corporate is very involved with maintaining these goals. Chilis makes everyone feel like there on the same team.
good,"I did serveral jobs at chilis. I started as a dishwasher and worked my way up. I wanted to become eventually a manager but never got the chance to do so."
good,The schedule at Chilis is very flexible.  Benefits are available for full time employees.
good,I waited on guests all day and night at our restaurant. This is where i first learned how amazing i am when it comes to customer service and dealing with other people. The people i worked with were great and the management as well. There was nothing difficult about this job and i really enjoyed speaking with guests and making their meal and time at our restaurant enjoyable.
good,"customer service, fast paced, short shifts, work weekends"
good,"its a very bussy place when we start to  open,    i learn to foccus and  be more professional even under presure & bussy time,"
good,"Chilis was a great learning experience, I learned how to deal with problematic customers, and also how to handle a fast paced workplace and think on your feet."
good,"In this business restaurant I was able to handle 7 tables in a appropriate manner with the guest satisfaction. I was well know as the top server. If other server's had question they will come to me for  answers, I was glad to be able to answer their question."
good,"Working in fast pace enviorment while keeping your composure"
good,"When I worked there, there was no drama and everyone got along. We came in a took care of business and had fun doing it!"
good,"A fun place to work, great management. Primarily evening hours, and not a guaranteed income, however, I enjoyed my employment."
good,A day at work was always filled with laughter and new experiences. I learned how to tend to different needs of many different people all at once. Management was relatively ok. My coworkers were amazing people from all over who enjoyed work and that made working with them far more enjoyable. Hardest part was adjusting to waiting on so many people but with just a little time it became an easy task. The most enjoyable part of work was when tables of 15+ people would come eat in my section and witnessing all the different celebrations people partake in.
good,"great free food for the employees and lets not forget the customers, lol. well, the customers don't get free food, but the employee do. great management that anyone can be or get comfortable with."
good,Chilis is probably the one place that i regret leaving... the food was wonderful and the people were great. Wonderful drinks and a energetic environment.
good,"Working in Chilis here in Kuwait give me more learnings and more improvement eventhough I am already above average in my past experience in kitchen. I learn so many standards for the operation of restaurant specially in food safety. Here in Kuwait the store that I had are the peak stores. The managers like me and always request for me because of the quality of work that I'm giving them. I always got a positive comment on the customers and ask who make their foods because for them its perfect specially it its a grilled meals. Here in Kuwait I always make my self busy in work checking the shelf life of every items, maintaining the cleanliness of the kitchen and doing something that is relevant to my work instead of talking to my colleagues. I just a silent person but still I have a lot of friends here in Kuwait. For me, the hardest part in my job is the time here in Kuwait that only few staff remained because of the company mishandling the people. Its very hard because instead of three person per station it become one man per station and there are a lot of guest that need to serve. But the most enjoyable part in my work here in Kuwait I still have time to bond with my friends and co workers. we go to mall or park or go fishing during our day off or available time."
good,"A typical day at work would be greeting tables and get their food out made to order fast and efficient. Working at Chili's Bar and Grill I learned that team work is a big factor in making everything move smooth and easy. Management was always there when needed and very dependable. I could always rely on my co-workers to help out when ever I was to busy. The hardest part of the job was trying to conduct the pace of the kitchen when a rush of customers would all come in at once. The most enjoyable part of the job was know that all of you're tables left happy, satisfied and full."
good,"Prep the line and cooked foods as the orders came in, I learned many different recipes, we had great managers that were awesome,my co-workers were great, it wasnt a hard part to the job, I love to cook soo everything fun."
good,"Enjoyed everyday of working here, no regrets whatsoever, but I hate I had to leave to go to summer school. The only downfall was when I finished summer school I tried to get my old job back but they weren't rehiring old people back."
good,All of the staff at Chili's was nice and supportive. If you needed someone to vent to then you could always turn to a coworker though their scheduling wasn't as great.
good,"My time at chili’s was pretty memorable and I learned a lot. I made connections with some great people and made a few friends along the way. It is very demanding and can be stressful to a breaking point at times, but overall the pay is great and the benefits are outstanding."
good,The people were great helpful n like a family! The restraunt closed and is a very sad thing! Worked very well together and loves the people.  Never will forget the experience!
good,"Thanks to Chili’s, I have learned a lot about customer service. I developed skills like having more patience with guests, to work under pressure and the most but not least important, team work."
good,I stumbled backwards into this job and was really impressed! I was hired as a dishwasher and started out at 11.00 dollar an hour just to wash dishes I eventually moved to prep cook and line cook. Once I moved there I felt I deserved a raise of some sort but didn’t get any considering the extra work load I had on my back but working back of house sure is great to say the least.
good,I was really happy working their. The staff was nice and there was a lot of nice people. The way you’re able to change your schedule works really well for my busy schedule.
good,"Long hours standing"
good,Chili’s is a great job for someone who doesn’t mind dealing with food and the rush that comes with it.if you can deal with the average restaurant rush you’d be good.
good,"Chili’s is a great company to work for, they work with you help you out if needed. They have great staff and a great environment to work in. I would recommend working there if your in the food industry"
good,Been working there almost 10years. I love it. I have gained so much from it starting out hostess/server till moving up to management. They offer opportunity.
good,Management would take care of any problems that I would come to them with and would help me the first couple days to figure out what I was doing. Very respectful and kind as long as you do your job correctly
good,My first job as a line cook was pretty fun. The workers in the back get to work and help each other out. Communication was good as well as the vibe coming from the rest of the staff. Very comfortable and relaxing place to work.
good,chili's is defiantly a great place to work everyday i come in i get ready to take on whatever the day throws at me. sometimes its busy and other times its steady. i learned that you cannot make everyone happy because youre just doing your job like your told and i learned more patience dealing with guest and coworkers.
good,"it was fun, made some really good friends, learned a lot, and did a lot at a fast paced work area. good food, cooks made food look good and so pretty."
good,"In a typical day at work i would arrive clock in and see the manager for any notes or side work. The following I would acompish all the tasks then accommodate to all th guests, if asked to do any side work I would do it as quickly as possible. It would not get to busy on weekdays but on game days or weekends it was packed. At chili's I learned how to operate machinery safely and work in a team. I also learned how to work under pressure"
good,"The management is awesome, the staff is nice & everyone overall treats one another with kindness and respect. My manager has really been flexible with my hours and schedule which I truly appreciate. I’d recommend the Chili’s I work at, to anyone starting new in the job industry. They have been awesome to me."
good,"Chili’s on the strip is a fast paced environment, lots of locals and tourists. Get to see and meet people from all over the world. Very great experience. Plenty of room to grow."
good,Management is very helpful. Everyone is friendly.  While there is no free food there is a great discount on select entrees.   Also quick to cut you from the floor when business is slow.( which is typical for food service industry.)  The food itself is very good and they have a lot of weekly and even daily returning customers.
good,Although we worked in a very productive It was a lot of drama but we didn't allow it to affect our money at all yet it was very hard working with some people yet I loved my coworkers.
good,"I don’t mind going to work because I love the people I work with & the environment i’m in. I’ve learned so much from the people I work with about hospitality & giving good service. Of course when things get super busy or rough at work, which they do, it’s makes my job a lot better for me because of that care a support we have for each other."
good,"All the employees were amazing and helpful. Compensation matched the work being done in my case. Management was superior, they made it feel homey with adequate structure."
good,i was in an hourly position and payed what they considered well but still isn't enough to pay a single bill and they dont care becuase cutting hourly people early gets them bonuses
good,"I learned to pick up speed and pick up for a team member who slacks. I loved getting regulars, and building relationships with them. Always was able to keep track of money that I had to hold on my entire shift (up to $1,000)."
good,"Working at Chili's I have gained many skills that help me on my own personal day to day duties. It is a fun environment where you get to meet new people everyday. The employees make the workplace fun and easy to work at. Even though it is a fast paced job, you never seem to get enough."
good,Chilis is a great company for a restaurant professional looking for advancements in the restaurant industry. The culture is pushed from the top down and applied in everything they do.
good,"Hosting first time was hard but as I got use to it I got better because it’s real easy job all I had to do is seat people, bust tables and make reservations. It’s nothing real personal I just worked there for experiences"
good,I enjoyed my time at Chili's. I made a lot of friends. I made good money. I had a great repor with my regulars. I was a trainer and my work was valued.
good,"Probably one of the most fun places I've had the opportunity working for."
good,Loved working there but due to budget cuts hours were cut from 35 hours per week down to 15 driving 15 miles each way for 3 hours a day sometimes 2 not worth the gas or time
good,"Fun workplace"
good,My coworkers are amazing. But management can be hard to deal with sometimes. The place can be unorganized and difficult to work with from time to time.
good,"Worked as a server, good place to work. Managers, coworkers, and food were great. Customers were overall good but any time a customer complained about anything we were required to send a manager to the table and they would always comp some or all of there food. Felt like it drew out the worst in customers, managers could be better equipped to resolve customer complaints."
good,"I enjoyed working at Chili's after High School but moved to Round Rock, TX I waited on tables and served food.  I enjoyed working with other people and I am very outgoing."
good,I love my job but am currently looking to relocate so looking for something with benefits so I can ensure for my future. I love working with the public and as a bartender leaving my guests in a better mood. A smile can go a long way.:)
good,"Mostly i was hosting which was pretty fun but I definitely preferred working to-go"
good,It was a great place to work I would recommend it to anyone who likes to be there. The pay is great and as togo you can keep your tips. I made really good money in togo.
good,"I enjoyed being apart of that team. They became close friends, aunts & uncles for my little girl. I’ve experienced different restaurants in NC before moving here and Chili’s Bar & grill is by far one of the best."
good,I enjoy going to work everyday. My co workers n managers are great most of the time. Chili's is a fast paced restaurant that really cares about their guest. You feel like family there and they do great charity work for St. Jude.
good,Good place to learn. Management is very good in turns of training and your overall development. Good place for freshar and learners. Good American brend.
good,A fast paced environment that allows you to meet new people. you have to think quick on your feet and the people are friendly. very flexible hour and growth.
good,Chillis was fun to work at and was a good starting job but I left because they didn’t give very many hours (about 12 per week) and I didn’t like how a lot of employees and managers acted there.
good,"Manager is very nice, compassionate and undersranding. Gives you the best 4 days training and evaluate. "
good,"A typical day at Chili's is very busy, and very stressful. I worked the front door and sat people, and on weekends and holidays there was always a wait. I learned that when people come together as a team, and do teamwork the shift always goes smoothly. The management team that I had was great. The helped us when we needed it. The hardest part of the was the customers that didn't tip. The most enjoyable part of this job was the team that worked with."
good,"I loved what I did and a typical day at work if we were busy I was great. There was great staff, management, and we of course cannot forget the customers."
good,First of all it is a balanced work place. With good teamwork but not many opportunities to advance. The best environment to have a non stressful job with good morale. But low pay rate.
good,Esta muy bien siempre y cuando se le de su tiempo como trabajo que es hay mucho crecimento y siempre estan al pendiente de que uno este agusto en la empresa
good,"I enjoy working at chilis. They provide a comfortable environment for their employees, and they are very understanding when there are situations that prevent someone from getting to work."
good,really great experience. its like a family there. you all work together for a common goal and a great time doing it. the managers all mostly care about you.
good,"The job environment varies greatly depending on the area, your co workers, and the customers that you have. The chilies I work at is very friendly and a very enjoyable place to work at."
good,I really enjoyed working at chili's just didn't get enough hours but wasn't  able to work nights and weekends so if you are able to work nights and weekends you can get all the hours you want. The management was always fair to me
good,"Its a line cook position. There are four stations and you prepare the food for that station. "
good,Everyone at Chilis was strong in their abilities and eager to help their fellow teammates at all times. A great family type atmosphere with good management team.
good,Chillis was a good place to work at very friendly environment good staff and management really learned a lot when it comes to multi tasking and working in customer service
good,Great customer base and team effort. Employees must be willing to work hard and perform many different tasks along with their job title. Lots of interaction with other people.
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo, oportunidad de crecimiento, trabajo en equipo y agradable, una experiencia muy linda trabajar ahí."
good,"Good place to work if you are just looking for some extra money."
good,"Very family friendly environment, It's a team effort job and highly demanding with many rewards, discounts on food, very flexible hours for full or part time. Brand is c"
good,"Management was great, really understood when you had personal problems. But like any family there was tough love. I really enjoyed working at Chili's Conroe."
good,Great experience for future customer service jobs. Friendly place for families and co workers to gather together and share a bond that would last farther than the work experience
good,"Brinker is a great company to work for, however my GM was horrid! After I left they switched management and I have only heard good things. They offer discounts on food however you can't eat during your shift which is annoying, but typical. They were great about time off and always made sure to give you breaks,"
good,"Good company to work for but like with any workplace, the managing has a lot to do with employee satisfaction. There is no paid time off, or if there is, the managers haven't informed us of it. That's really the only downfall. There is insurance available for part time employees, which is nice. If you haven't given Chili's a chance as a work place, I would. This job was only supposed to be temporary and I'm 2.5 years in."
good,"It's a great place to work. great coworkers and great atmosphere. There are slow times just like any other job, but over all it's a great place to work."
good,This was a good company to work for. They are good about working around your schedule and it was good money for the little amount of time I had to work during th week. good people.
good,"Chili's has an incredible training program in place for hourly and salaried team members, the director of operations is very supportive and overall has your back when needed."
good,"Chilis is always a safe place to take your family out when your hungry. Wait staff is always willing to help, great customer service, great food along with great drinks and an average cost per meal equals a good time"
good,"Very fast paced and overwhelming at first, but once you get the hang of it, it is a great place with great people.  Management changes quite frequently though."
good,Excellent leadership at the corporate level.  They provide lots of training and give you the tools to do your job.  I would still be employed if it were not for company policy of resignation and intent to leave.  I asked for my job back after putting in a notice and policy preventing me from coming back or continuing employment despite my excellent record and successful day to day operations.
good,Chilis is one the best restaurant and company ever. cool people and a lot of good guest everyday. One of the best company ever that i've worked even though my work is for 6 days a week
good,I enjoyed working here I just started a bit young. I wasn't able to be promoted to a server so I decided it be best to leave. I could not make enough money jut working weekends.
good,Very stressful environment  but very nice people  there and they all are team players. Chili's taught me how to deal with stress in the work place. I enjoyed the work but there was no opportunity for advancement.
good,"A typical day at Chilis is super fast-paced and we tend to have a lot of customers on the weekend, plus you tend to get short breaks (if any) all of which can also be a down side if you have never worked in the food industry before. Management is very nice, and goofy so they are actually giant pluses. They also tend to understand if you need a day off as long as you give a fair warning. This plus the fact that you get to meet new people and make friends are the benefits of working there."
good,"This was my first severing job so I learned so much, how to deal with guest how to multitask in a busy environment. I learn about the American- Mexican style culture and about the foods. this is where I learned about drinks and became a bartender. where my skills got and improved throughout the years. I always thank chili""s"
good,"I have Chili's as a second job and I love it. It's great to be able to go in to work and come out with cash, it makes getting by in between paychecks much easier. I love the people that I work with, all great characters, the guests are great to interact with, most of them, anyway. Chili's is a fast moving restaurant and it's helped me learn to prioritize and multitask tremendously."
good,"Lugar bueno como para empezar a trabajar, un buen clima laboral y todos nos ayudamos desde el inicio"
good,This is a good job to help start you out and to help teach you how to work with people. I learned a ton from working here and I will give it a great review it to anyone who would ask.
good,Working at Chili's was a wonderful team work experience. Having the experience i had they immediately put on as a lead in the kitchen and i loved it. The management team were always helpful in time of need and understanding when it came to family life outside of work.
good,chili's has extensive training but this will be good for anyone who do not have any experience in working as a server.  fun to work with but most of the time your working hours is extended without overtime pay.
good,Working together as a team throughout the entire restaurant to make sure our customers enjoy their visit. From getting sat at a table to finishing with dessert. Chili's Maplewood is an enjoyable to place to work because of the great management and staff. We try to make the best out of any situations and help one another.
good,"Very fun place to work"
good,Company provides clear and unambiguous directions/ expectations. Great development for professional and personal growth. Benefits are available within 30 days of employment.
good,Love working here and love the people. Always looking forward to meeting new customers!  Management is great and is there to help you grow as a worker. Food is cooked cleanly and in timely fashion.
good,"Working at chili's was a really good experience for me. i was able to work with many different people, practice fast paced business, and i made some really good friends. the location was in the middle of a busy part of town so we saw many different people of different cultures. it got hard when people would become overwhelmed or impatient with waiting to be seated but the team always worked together so no one was too overwhelmed."
good,I enjoyed working here. The main reason I left was because I had found a better job elsewhere. The management was awesome and the other employees were great.
good,"I enjoyed working there and made some friends through the job itself. I was able to learn more about how to be a team member, and how to be responsible."
good,"A typical day varies drastically based on business, weekends and weekdays are drastically different."
good,I worked for Chili's while i was a student in college. Management was AMAZING! Worked with your schedule. Good opportunity to move up if you wanted.. just be honest with management about your goals.
good,I have spent 9 years working for this company and its a great company I just need better job security and benefits then I am getting here hardest part of the job was making sure all the guests were taken care of and leaving happy and id have to say that was the most fun part too cause you never know what kind of people you were going to meet on a daily basis. I learned a lot about myself because I used to think I have very little patience but working in that industry I have realized I don't give myself enough credit.  In those 9 years i've seen a lot of managers come and go personally i've worked with probably at least 20 different managers in the 3 locations I have worked so its kind of hard to stay consistent when they are constantly changing management
good,"Fast-paced work environment, awesome coworkers, management was great most times. Would work for this company again in the future. Flexible work schedules and time off"
good,They have great food for great prices. always have promos going on. if you need anything management will do what they have to do. fun and friedly environment
good,"La empresa en general es muy buena, el sueldo respecto al trabajo es justo, el ambiente con los compañeros es bastante bueno y la relación con la mayoría de los jefes tiende a ser accesible. Respecto a los horarios pueden llegar a ser un poco complicados y muy variados, ya que se rolan turnos, y eso puede permitirte, o no llevar una vida equilibrada."
good,This sounds like a great place for me to work. I love a challenge and fast paced. I've work in several kitchen's through out canton and massillon ohio. Some were boring and pay was kinda low and others weren't challenging enough for me. I worked at a fast paced bar and grill known as Harmons pub. It was slammed every night and the kitchen would close around 12 weekdays and 1am on weekends. I am  use to keeping up on my dishes at all times and running trask through out kitchen and dining rooms along with bussing tables and greeting customers. Im very self and semi professionally experienced. I also am kinda a proffessionalist when fry cooking and saute cooking while plating the cooked foods in a manor of design. Im available any day or night. Any date plus weekends and holidays.  Sarta bus is my transportation as of now non-felone . please give me that one shot to improve your kitchen and to amaze you're expectations. Thank you.
good,I very much enjoy working here and making new friends. I like being in a team oriented environment and being able to rely on my coworkers if needed. We all help each other out as much as possible and that is how a team should work.I always learn that each new table and people are going to be different so I adapt myself.
good,"Ambiente saludable, organizado y sobre todo llevan un buen trabajo en equipo."
good,"Duties included: Hands on experience in guest relations and customer service, lead trainer for OJT classes, prepping and preparing food orders for customers and flight crewmembers. Responsible for checking and up holding NSF standards are being held though the sanitation of utensils and food preparation workstations with food safety, orders and receiving products from approved venders, stocking the food pantry and customer areas. Handle cash and credit cards transactions. Managing a large crew of 30 or more with any misc. duties as needed.The crew members are the best part of the job. they make coming to work worth while, however like most jobs it has its ups and downs."
good,I loved working for this company. Really involved in the community and other world fun raisers . Management was great. The function of the place was less stressful.
good,I love my management team. Competitive spirit so fun place to work. The company really cares about the employees. Have many work outings
good,good work place and easy to balance life and work . coworker are nice.management if for the most part great you get a discount card for 50 % off your entire check
good,"Chili's is a great company to work for with potential advancements within the company.  There are also, however, certain situations in which your excellence may be unnoticed."
good,"it was great for growth in the fast paced environment and very , managment and staff members were friendly and it was great food"
good,"I enjoy the work that I do overall. Chili's can be fast paced, but also it has it's slow moments. I have learned how to lead by example and work quickly, but efficiently. I love my coworkers and the management team is always willing to help and instruct."
good,"I was a server and my job was to wait on tables and take care of our patrons."
good,A typical day consisted of jumping right in to customer service with a smile and great attitude. Co workers were like family and management cared greatly for each person they managed. The hardest part of the job was the late hours. The most enjoyable was being able to be outgoing and truly show your personality.
good,We stayed very busy throughout the day making our day short. Even when we were working double in some days. The staff was friendly. The clients were appreciative of all food services. Overall a very successful dat to day operation.
good,"Working in a restaurant you never know what kind of a day you are walking into.         On average it is very fast paced requiring skills such as multi-tasking and efficiency to make it through the day successfully.  In this restaurant word managers and co-workers become like family.  Learning to communicate and help one another in order to get the job done.  The hardest part about the job is learning how to manage different personalities to avoid conflicts.  Along the same lines, the variety of people you encounter daily is the best part about the job.  Over my 6 years at Chili's i have become very attached to multiple customers who have become my regular visitors and have actually developed friendships with people of all ages."
good,"A typical shift for Quality Assurance (QA) is 1.5 to 3 hours and for To-Go it varies between 2-6 hours per shift. QA wage starts out at $8 per hour and To-go is minimum wage plus tips. My co-workers are great and fun to work with. Management is usually pretty good but there are times where they can be a bit less than helpful. The hardest part of the job is either when you are scheduled as both QA and To-Go and both positions are busy at the same time or simply trying to keep a budget going because the hours fluctuate rather drastically. The most enjoyable part is when things go smoothly and everybody(including managers) works together as a cohesive team. This job would probably be most suitable for someone who has extra time on their hands and would like something fast paced. Hours are hard to come by at this location (I am listed as full-time, full availability and have been since May 2015 and have barely made part time hours.) This company does offer a nice variety of discounts on goods and services within the company and with other companies."
good,Greet customers. take drink orders. give the best service i could give. loved the managers that I worked with. the hardest part of my job is that it was a part-time job but I worked full time on top of a full time job. loved getting to know people. brought me out of my shell.

good,"very busy work place, i served drinks in a fast pace busy environment"
good,If I didn't have to depend on others such as lyft uber and family/friends I would give it all 5 stars but i like the environment it's not as stressful as the other chillis I worked for!
good,I love the fact I could just transfer to a different chili’s every time I moved. I have found most of my closest friends working @ 3 different chili’s. And I couldn’t ask for a better company to work for.

good,It's was fun. Never cooked before but I learned alot from about food prep and cooking in general. Hardest part of the job was relying on others to get food out at the same time. Management was fair.
good,"I always see people having issues with working at Chili's but ultimately it depends which location you work at. The one I work at is absolutely wonderful. All the staff from the hosts, bussers, servers and cooks even dishwashers are like one large family. We have amazing teamwork and great management. So don't judge Chili's off of one location, there are some amazing ones out there!"
good,"This location is a hot garbage fire at alot of times. Managers can't agree on one thing, but the people are so kind and supportive. The team was amazing and I loved working there, despite all the chaos."
good,"Fue una experiencia muy agradable el hecho de conocer como es la atención al cliente, la presión de entregar platillos rápido con calidad, valorar lo que tengo y la oportunidad que me dieron, convivir con todo tipo de personas en cuestión económica, nadie es más que alguien solo por tener o no,  aprendí mucho de cada uno de mis compañeros y gerentes pero lo más importantes aprendí de mi mismo y como tratar a las personas."

good,Chilis was all about team work when the shift changed the mangers would have a floor meeting just to give us a positive motavational talk which basically got everyone happy and ready to work.Then we would all go to our stations rather you were a cook or hostess and just make sure you were prepped with the thing you needed for the job you were assigned to for example i was a cook so we checked the dates on food made sure it was fresh and dated also up to date stocked plates and food refrigerators with fresh food that would be needed.As a host we made sure our menus were clean stocked and table section floors and tables were clean and ready for use.
good,"Usually at work it would start slow so you take time to do your silverware and get ready for the shift, maybe talk to a few coworkers and then start the night with your tables and working hard to meet the needs of all with a happy smiling face!"
good,A typical day at work started at 7 am and I would prep the food for the day for the cooks to have enough stuff that they would be able to not have to worry about doing prep work. At the end of the shift we would clean the kitchen area and leave

good,Very great place to go and great workers. It was not enough pay and did not realize how hard of a worker I was and no raises after a year. I loved all workers but lots of drama that didn't get taken care of. One of the female managers were the main reason for all the problems.
good,Overall this is just a fast food restaurant so don't expect to get a lot of happy guests to be pleased with their food and get a lot of complaints but on the weekends the money can be good.

good,I would have loved to stay longer. I never vibed with a better staff and everything was always handled in a very professional manner. Any issue or question you had with the company was addressed professionally. Management treated us all great and I don't think I know a place that held more a consistent staff. The weekly promotions and competitions we participated in was the best part about it. Gift cards or free meals for the week was great incentive. It was nice having recurring guests that would request you upon arrival.
good,I was put into the role of Delivery Sales Manager and thoroughly enjoyed reaching corporate goals to expand delivery of our product throughout the Philadelphia Center City area.
good,Our management team was great. If u worked with them they would work with. There were the bare minimum of issues. The company will look out for you if you are a asset.

good,"My typical day at work during the week is coming in turning on the dish washer, filling up sanitizer buckets, putting ziosks batteries in the ziosk, putting trash bags in the barrels, walking around the restaurant for trash."
good,"Brinker is a solid company. Information is disseminated well.. The company has a great ""cult"" culture. They believe in development and are concerned about there team..  If you are ok working in the hospitality industry its a good company to work for. Only negative is work life balance."
good,"Chili's is a fast paced, friendly work environment. Training process sets you up for success. Employees and managers are all friendly and customers are all very pleasant."
good,When I show up I immediately clock in and get to work since people are always flowing in and out. I usually work with one other host/hostess and help out with bussing and keeping everything clean. I've learned how to think on my feet and to always keep the customers happy. My coworkers and I help each other out when it is needed and work together peacefully.
good,People were so friendly and the workplace is usually very busy so we had to keep on grinding. It was a really fun experience because we were really guided from the start.
good,"Great, fun place to work. I started as a server, and moved to bartending fairly quickly. Also, the company cares and helps the employees. I had a family emergency 200+ miles away. My managers and district manager came together and donated travel funds."

good,"One of the best I have worked for. Always upbeat they want you to succeed and make sure you have the most thorough training. I managers, front and back of the house all work together."
good,I loved working here it was a great environment and people were awesome. managers were very understanding and worked with you. if I could I would work here again in a heartbeat and recommend it to everyone.
good,its a very fun and fast paced environment. very production and you determine your pay. can be very demanding and stressful at times. but overall a good job for a young adult
good,"As a student, it is a good job but it's not a career. It is a great job for a younger person but other than that, it's not worth it. It was fun though while i was in school."
good,"Chilis is a fun company to work for that constantly gives back to the community. helps their employees on a personal level. there is also plenty of room for advancement,"
good,It's a good place to work if you want to be a server. It's always busy from day to night so there's no doubt you'll make money. You can even pick up more shifts if you need to.
good,Worked with a lot of really great people. The management was awesome. The hours where short but you could easily pick up more. The pay was minimum for hostesses and those who worked in the back. The rest relied on tips mostly.
good,"3 meses de entrenamiento gerencial por una unidad certificada de entrenamiento, evaluaciones constantes para aumentos de sueldo, buena cultura laboral, me enseño mucho de administracion de un negocio. lo dificil son los horarios ya que son rotativos y trabajas todos los dias del año, la direccion es estricta pero buena, debe mejorar a los diferentes departamntos de apoyo con los que cuenta el gerente ya que toman mucho tiempo para solucionar problemas. El crecimiento se da si haces bien tu trabajo y tienes la capacidad para el siguiente puesto."
good,Fantastic place to work. The location I worked at closed so unfortunately relocating to a new restaurant didn't work for me. Would work here again. Pay is well worth the work.
good,chili's was a fantastic restaurant to work for as far as income and the staff. very busy location and staff became like second family. i just wanted something different with set schedule etc.
good,Fue un trabajo bueno donde obtuve la experiencia necesaria para despues cambiar de empleo

good,"I enjoyed working in this fast paced environment on a wonderful team of sterling individuals. I had the opportunity to, on a daily basis, come in contact with a variety of different types of people and I thoroughly loved it. It was a place I thrived in."
good,"I mainly worked as hostess and in Togo, the energy is high level with high volume of people coming in. great group of people and management really took care of you and he customers."
good,"I worked there as a waitress part time in college, the management was very felxable, and always approved days off if they could. The work wasnt too challenging."
good,"Typical day was taking care of the guest, serving food and drinks and assisting team members. Learned how to balance 10-15 tables at once, improved my skills at multi-tasking. Management was good and bad, it all depended on the restaurant location and the culture they installed onto the staff, The hardest part of the job was balancing four or five jobs at once,(i.e. Bartending, serving tables, togo, host, and expo ) while giving the guest excellent service. Most enjoyable was working with the guest and team members, meeting new people on a daily basis."
good,Restaurants seem to be the same no matter which one you decide to work at. The location that I work at happens to be employed by some of the best people and managers that I have ever met and it has been great knowing them. Its very cool to go to work and have some of your best friends working besides you. Chili's definitely makes coworkers seem like family and friends. Very uplifting environment considering how brutal serving tables can be.
good,I only worked at Chili's for a short time and loved the people I worked with! They were all very helpful and team players. Loved the fast paced environment
good,"On a typical day, you will work about 10 hours on your feet. But you will learn a lot about engaging guest, working as a Team, influencing your Team and being a strong leader. Leadership at Chili's is phenomenal, but with that, you have to perform and meet expectations of the brand, which can be stressful at times. The Culture is what YOU allow and create, so be an active part of making it great and using our their cultural tools and living the cultural beliefs. The hardest part is not being there with your family as much as you would like to in operations, which ultimately led to me resigning. But I enjoyed the brand, I enjoy my Team and I enjoyed egging with guest daily. I would come back, but definitely at the RSC level."
good,"If you like restaurant work this is a fun place to be.  One of my favorite places to work,  I would work there again if I had the chance.  Great learning environment and customers are always friendly."
good,"Awesome bosses, great employees. Everything flowed so well. No drama. Everyone liked to work together. I would highly recommend this job to anyone in the food industry."

good,a typical day at work consists of a busy shift working with many different partners to have a successful shift and to make sure side work is completed. I learned how to work well with many different people. management staff are ok but helpful. hardest part of the job would be multitasking

My management was very professional 8 out 10 times. The work place culture was fun and fast paced. The hardest part of my job was learning that not everyone can be pleased. The most enjoyable part of my job was being around my team.
good,A typical day at work includes immediately clocking on and greeting customers. There are rarely any issues within the workplace whether it be the customers or coworkers. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to go home and still communicate with coworkers because they're great people and friends.

good,While at Chilis I learned that when you're stressed about work you can count on someone to help you out a bit. The workplace is very centered around making the guests feel special and you can see it reflect in how much you make.

good,"At a typical day at a restaurant the hostess is the first employee to interact with arriving guests as they enter the restaurant. It is the job of the hostess to greet arriving guests, welcome them into the establishment and seat them."
good,"I like that they had mid-day shifts. Management was great, they all worked along to work towards one goal! The only thing that was new to me, with the serving job is serving alcohol, which wasn't so much of a hassle to get the liquor license."

good,"Just fine:)))"
good,Through the Chili's values and morals it creates a family like feeling in the restaurant. Chili's has a great way of combing all aspects of the restaurant to one entire entity.
good,I worked for Brinker for almost 15 years and was able to work my way up from being a hostess all the way into management. A very motivating company to be a part of.
good,"If you want to work an excessive number of hours and have the opportunity to make plenty of money; Chili's is the place to reach that goal. Management will offer you hours, the opportunity to advance and an excellent benefit package from day one."
good,"A typical shift working at Chili's work be opening the restaurant and opening the bar. I would be cleaning everything as well as preparing for the day. I would be cutting all the fruit, making sure that all the juices were still good and if they needed to be filled up.  I would walk around the restaurant to make that the tables were clean and that the floors were swept. The restaurant would open and guests would come in. While working at Chili's I made lots of friends and the management team was great as well. While being there I taught new staff how to serve and host as well as teach them how to use the system.  I miss working there but now I'm onto bigger and better things."
good,"It is a pleasant place to work. I learned how to care for customers and the struggle of balancing many tables at once. Fortunately, it was an easy place to start and perfect my serving skills."
good,"Un lugar donde aprendi muchisimo y me capacite para lograr todo lo que se hasta ahora.."
good,"Management was very hands on and helped with every aspect of the restaurant. We were the busiest restaurant in Carbondale,so every server was constantly running to make sure every table had their needs met. The hours were long and hard, but the pay was worth it."

good,"Great management team, somewhat high employee turnover rate, training program needs some work"
good,"Se Trabaja muy agusto en Chilis, se aprende a trabajar en equipo y siempre buscar y lograr metas, te conviertes en gran lider ya que la empresa cuenta con Valores encaminados a el buen trato entre personas, cada quien sabe lo que tiene que hacer, es una Gerencia muy completa ya que te conviertes en Administrador, Lider, Gerente, De Recursos Humanos, Supervisor, etc, la parte mas complicada del trabajo es que son demaciadas hras de trabajo al dia, en ocaciones hasta 12, y no son horarios fijos. Pero en general una excelente escuela de trabajo se aprende muchisimo."
good,"I absolutely loved working for Chili's Bar and Grill. My typical day at work included waiting on the customers with their food and drink requests or any other request they may have. I think I learned a lot while working here like multitasking, selling our products, proper customer service. I eventually became a trainer and was allowed to train multiple people at one, which was a wonderful experience to have. The management we had was absolutely amazing. They would help you physically with tasks that needed to be done and they were not afraid to get their hands dirty when helping us clean. They were great trainers as well. You could go to them with any problem and you would all solve the issue together. I loved my co-workers and actually keep in touch with a few of them today. This was a place of team work and we were never shy to help each other out, whether we were in the ""weeds"" or not. The hardest part about my job would have to be training those who had no desire to learn or even be there. That was the frustrating part. But for the most part I enjoyed getting to see everyone at work and seeing our customers come in. It was fast paced and just an overall  great experience for me. Working in a restaurant helped me to develop much needed skills that are required in the work place."
good,"My usual shift averaged 10-12 hrs. The Florence SC Chilis was a franchised restaurant.  I entered into this position with a strong management background but no stand alone restaurant experience.  I cherished the opportunity and the extensive training I received.  One of the main reasons I was offered this position was due my management and law enforcement background.  It was a troubled store with the staffing and customer base.  I enjoyed turning that around and increasing profitability by training employees, lowered comps, ensuring the recipes were adhered to, and keeping a loyal customer base.  After a short time numerous ""old"" guest returned.  I left with a feeling of accomplishment.  I left for personal reasons, including a 75 mile one way drive to work."
good,a typical day started with prepping your work area with a co-worker. i learned how to properly deal with patrons and deliver food and make drinks in a timely manner with a great attitude. management was always helpful and enjoyable. There was no hard part of the job. the best part of the job was the environment.
good,"my day consists of meeting and greeting students, staff, employees and even citizens of tallahassee to chilis on Florida state university campus. coming to work in an presentable and clean uniform that was provided by chilis and keeping a smile on my face and attitude of achievement and growth. i learned that teamwork makes the dreamwork and asking for help is sometimes the best way to go. working with ambitious people that enjoy and love their job as much as i do is warming, comforting, makes me eager to go to work everyday. the hardest part of the job is to work with people that does not like to smile and make the worst better. that comes to work and take thing personally instead of keeping it professional and maintaing great leadership. the most enjoyable part of the job is to bring a hot plate full of scrumsious food that feels the heart with a warm spirit and healthy to where you want to spread the word of chilis great food, team and representation of Florida state university."
good,"An excellent atmosphere and great group of servers, cooks, and managers."
good,"I enjoyed my employment .I have grown in many ways. I learned a lot, how to deal and handle a guest, specially the standard and team work. My co-workers, Management Team and I are helping each other to reach our goal. We are giving our best to give the guest satisfaction."
good,"i start my shift clocking in ,greeting mod,co-workers, set-up work station for duration of shift.the most enjoyable part of the day for me is the busiest part of the shift and the hardest for me is closing"
good,enjoyed working for Chillis great place to work  low stress much support from management and coworkers
good,"normally lots of guest dine in in or branch, different kind of personality, and learned how to handle different kind of attitude. happy to serve them with full customer service. with my co workers happy to work with them because we are all happy doing our job together, full of cooperation's and teamwork."
good,I enjoyed working for this company and all it stands for. Friendly management and severing staff.
good,muy buena empresa para trabajar y desarrollarte en el ambito gastronomico y facilidades para subir de puesto. la verdad que es una muy buena empresa no me arrepiento de haber trabajado ahi y ser parte de esa gran familia.
good,"I enjoyed working at Chili's, just ready for a new adventure."
good,"I have the opportunity to work alongside a variety of personalities that work hard to provide a pleasurable experience to the guests at Chili's.  I am in charge of tailoring the guest's experience to their specific needs while seamlessly providing quality customer service so as to secure return visits. Management takes the time to gather both team member and guest feedback regarding the individual's experience with Chili's and is always willing to contribute to various areas of the restaurant when necessary.  The hardest part of the job is providing a cohesive and highly individualized experience to all guests while maintaining high productivity and a low rate of error.  The most enjoyable part is very much tied into the hardest part, the fact that the job is never the same and requires a creative mind that is always willing to be flexible and open to change and feedback."
good,"A typical day at work begins by getting yourself ready for a shift.  Find out who your service partner is, talk with them to get a game plan on how you will work your section and starting serving customers. Managers will tell you before your shift any goals, contest, or important information needed to help you have a productive positive work shift.  The hardest part of my job is time management. Waiting tables, running food, busing your own tables and maintaining some form of repore with each customer is a challenge at times. Devoting equal time to each person and task can be impossible at times.  The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing you pleased your customers and they ask you to serve them again in the future.  Seeing my customers leave happy is a great feeling."
good,"Es un trabajo en él que cada día es diferente ya que siempre van invitados nuevos a los cuales recomendaba platillos, bebidas, postres para que vieran la amplia variedad que se maneja en la marca y la razón por la cual son únicos. Me gusto mucho mi trabajo ya que te da la oportunidad de conocer a muchas personas y tienes un trato directo con los invitados, cada día aprendes algo nuevo tanto de los compañeros como de las personas que lo visitan, es un ambiente muy relajado en el cual tienes gran libertad para que cada persona muestre su propio estilo al atender. No estoy segura de que fue lo mas difícil para mi, como todo considero que fue el principio el tener que aprender tantas cosas nuevas ya que es muy difícil vender algo si no lo conoces, de allí la importancia. Lo que mas me gusto fue el gran grupo tanto de amigos como de compañeros que tenía eramos un gran equipo que considero siempre nos supimos apoyar por lo cual aprendí a disfrutar mi trabajo, era interactivo y divertido, siempre había algo por hacer."
good,"Great place to work, I loved almost everything about it. and all of the people."
good,"this job was a roller coaster, i loved it then i hated it, then i loved it and hated it again."
good,"Brinker International overall is a great place to work.  They have a fabulous, laid back job culture and strongly encourage work/life balance.  They only negative was not having job security.  Lay offs were frequent and could happen at any time."
good,"I have worked for this job for 13 years. I have had ups and downs with the job, management but it has recently been thru changes that make it a positive place to work."
good,"I work in Chilis for about 6 days a week , I learned everything about food and beverage service and hospitality management, they train us well specially in dealing with the guests and upselling our products, i love my co workers a lot we work as a team and at the end of the day every task is accomplished perfectly, for me I think the hardest part of the job is travelling, because I work too far, I travel for about 40 kilometers everyday back and forth but it didnt bother me because I allot 2 1/2 hours for travelling, the most enjoyable part is we met and interact to a lot of people,different nationality, different views about life and share with them a few thoughts about life."
good,"This is a stressful job, with a fun friendly tone between the front and back of the house. I very much enjoyed my experience with the company"
good,"En esta empresa te enseñan a trabajar en equipo."
good,"I learned how to deal with different types of variety of people, different nationalities, different attitudes."
good,i met a lot of nice people while working for chili's. the pay wasn't very good and the schedules were off the wall but all in all it was a nice atmosphere
good,"Typical Day depends on my duties. When I host, I review the floor chart and if it's not made, I make it myself. I make my rotation and follow it throughout the shift; continuously seat guests and communicate with management. When I QA I make sure my line is stocked. Same when I am togo. "
good,"I loved working at Chili's for many reasons. It was a great way to make money while taking college courses. I was constantly engaged with people and in a social environment, which overall helped my communications skills strive! The money is great for a first job or while going to school, but it was not the kind of money I was looking for in regards to a future. After college, I wanted to use my degree to prosper and there weren't many positions for advancement in this company. However, it was a great place to work and suited my needs well while I was there. The team aspect of this company is an amazing way to understand the modern workplace. I learned a ton!"
good,"Chili's gives you a great beginning understanding to restaurant management.  They have it dialed in when it comes to training, systems and controls."
good,Very comfortable friendly environment. Loved working with people. Always unpredictable.
good,excelente solo un poco mas de paga y seguiría ahí ya que da mas estabilidad y tengo una hija y esposa.
good,I loved working at chili's. Being around and helping people is what I like to do.
good,"Es el trabajo en el que me eh sentido mas cómoda, ya que aprendí a ser mas centrada, en atender como quisiera ser atendida, a tener una actitud inmejorable, a trabajar por objetivos, la gerencia se porto bien hacia mi, aunque en ocasiones no se me respetaban mis horarios de descanso y de comida, mis colegas los mejores, un muy buen equipo de trabajo siempre apoyándonos en todo momento, siendo muy serviciales, la parte mas difícil es cuando algún miembro del equipo falta y cubrirlo en momentos puede ser fatigante pero siempre lo disfrute, lo que mas me gusto fue el que me pude dar cuenta que mi servicio es muy bueno, en muchas ocasiones los invitados me lo mencionaban así como a gerencia y lo comentaban en las encuestan que se realizaban."
good,Personally had a very enjoyable work relationship with this company for over 6 years. Felt like I could grow within this company easily but was not the career path I wanted to take in my life.
good,Friendly athmosphere.  I was happy to take on extra responsibility and help where I was needed.  Restaurant closed so I had to find another job closed home.  
good,"It is ok, just another restaurant job. but a good place to start off and make quick money."
good,"As a hostess I gave out menus, interacted with guests, and managed call aheads. The management is awesome, they work well around school and activities outside of work. The most enjoyable part of the job was just being in a friendly enviornment. Great job to start out at!"
good,The general manager I worked for is one of the best managers I have ever had. He really cared about his employees and has a passion for what he does.
good,There was always something to do while i was on the clock. Coworkers were very friendly and the Managers always worked around your schedule.
good,i loved meeting new faces as they walked throughthe door.my mangement was great. i love to work wit people daily.
good,"Woking as a hostess was a great first time job as a college student. Managment was very flexible with hours and willing to listen to any issues you may have had in the workplace. Overall, it was a great 3 years!"
good,"During the regular work day I answer the phones, take orders, count money, and run multiple tasks. Every day can have its challenges and to me that is what I enjoy doing. I love talking to people that I do not know and being able to brighten their days."
good,"Chili's was a great place to work, cooking and prepping the food, for great customer experience!"
good,"Had a great experience working for Chili, I like working with different type of people and my experience with my co workers was very good, we were a team."
good,A typical shift at a resturant is very fast paced and lots of running around.Being able to multi task is required.Usually management did a great job of controlling the chaos.I learned a lot about being open minded when dealing with customers and coworkers.The hardest part was managing your money because of the instability due to our wages.The fun part was knowing that I could put a smile on a customers face by simply providing them a service.
good,Working for this company for over six years gave me a huge understanding about balance between productivity and communcation. There is no hard part of this job. My co-workers and I are like family every time we work together. The mangement was amazing. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting all of the customers.
good,"Workers were friendly, managers were as well. The management was knowledgable and helpful. Clean and safe work environment."
good,the co workers were nice but the managment team there sucked. we went through so much mangers. and our general manger was the worst.
good,"Very comfortable place to work. I learned a ton about many responsibilities, teamwork and dedication to the work environment."
good,"fun, flexible hours, pay is good, friendly staff, management is great"
good,"Great Place to work , good management staff great employees"

good,I absolutely loved this job. bosses were flexible and ready to work around my schooling and medical appointments. they give everyone an equal oppertunity to work there.
good,I’ve been a server for 2 years very hands on with people. Also very energetic and willing to learn new things. I can work in any weather conditions and willing to work any hours available
good,I enjoyed the Chilis family. They are very family based and cares about the employees. Many options are available as far as family assistance and family leave.
good,Hate new management but love what i do.. I love the interaction with guest love too make people smile and enjoy there experience.. If you come in hungry and sad i want you to leave happy and full and come back again just for me:)
good,"when i came to the interview they were very happy and welcoming, they were easy to communicate with. i have nothing but good things to say, not to mention a great benefit with college."
good,Everything I have learned from the past was easy to blend in with what the Chili’s management taught me. I learned a lot more about customer services and to-go’s.
good,"Everyday I went into work, the staff had a great attitude and were easy to get along with. The management was great and would work with employees within reason of situation. I learned phenomenal teamwork skills with both staff and management. Chili's is an awesome company to work for!"

good,Chili’s is a great company to work for. They take care of their own and are always ready to make any changes for what the market demands. I always wanted to run my own business and when a great opportunity came up I took it. Only reason I left.
good,I  loved working for chillis. They were extremely awesome.  They never once did me wrong. I highly recommend them. Management was great and the whole staff was amazing. The room to grow was like no other
good,I loved chilli's this job being you a great experience as a service this job is great for college students u can make great money with company it will bring you great opportunities to succeed in life I swear u will not regret working with this company
good,Chilis is a great place to start in the food service industry. The culture is great. They train you extensively on customer service and providing guests a memorable visit. Would recommend
good,"I love Chili's so much! It is a fun and cool place to work and make great money; however, now being in the company for so long I wish to branch out and do something new, possibly a little more upscale."
good,"A typical day is a ten hour work day.  It could be an opening, mid or closing shift. Each manager has responsibilities pertinent to that particular shift.  "
good,"I work in a smaller store so the bar really only has room for one bartender or two at most if we have a major company special. As the bartender you're responsible for not only all of your guest but making the drinks for the whole restaurant. You are also your own barback so you do the prep, restock ice and juices, and wash your own glassware. Busy nights can feel like a marathon but the pay is usually great. Where the pay is not great is where you are only slightly busy so most people get cut and sent home. You are then responsible for everything previously listed on top of, being the host, the cocktail server and now the to go person as well. While doing all of the jobs you are still paid a whole 2.13 an hour."
good,Enjoyed taking care of my guests and making sure they had all there needs and left with a smile so they would return knowing they got great service by me
good,Great place to work.  Awesome staff.  This store is very busy but it makes it fun and we have a large number of regulars that we get to know.  The staff is very supportive and management works hard to help the store be successful
good,Es un buen sitio pero es algo pesado en veces igual me gustó trabajar aquí
good,"Everyone that works there, is willing to help others. The team is very close. We help each other stay calm. The hardest part of the job is dealing with upset customers. The easiest part about the job is working with such great coworkers."
good,I became best friends with a bunch of my co workers. That is what will make leaving the job so difficult. I learned how to communicate with people in a proper matter. I also learned to help with conflicts. The hardest part of the job would have to be the busy nights. The best part of the job would have to the compliments and achievements I have received.
good,Chili's is a great place to work. The management is good most of the time. It's a server/bartender job so it is stressful but not too overwhelming in the long run.
good,"working at chillis was a lot of fun, I was very upset to leave because of school but I would go back in a heartbeat. it was fast pace and everyone ho worked there was very welcoming"
good,great staff that motivates you .......i really woke up looking forward to going to work even though the going got tough sometimes but i still managed to leave with a smile on my face
good,"It's a fast paced environment, however it can have its slow days. It's always fun to come in to work and have fun with both managers and other coworkers."
good,A great company but still some things to work on. For the most part everyone tries to play their part and strive for the culture they are trying to execute in their restaurants.
good,"Some days were slow, some days were fast. You could swap shifts however it suited you so if you wanted to work slow easy shifts you could swap your fast shifts with someone else."
good,"Being a line cook was fun and rewarding. its a fast pace work and takes great communication skills amd the ability to stay focused in stressful situations, in my time they're some of my daily activities included,     "
good,Great work environment great atmosphere nice people would definitely recommend for all backgrounds and people who are looking for a place to work  tVs everywhere so you won’t miss none of the games during the NFL plus a large open bar  and they have the best appetizers
good,Great company to work for but all in all my co-workers made that job one of my favorite places to work at.  Great food and one of the best customer service
good,"- A typical day at work would be super enjoyable. You would show up, get your section, eat some food, and work!"
good,You truly get to build your communication skills and leadership or teamwork skills. Management does care about its employees. Could be very stressful sometimes.
good,"I genuinely enjoy working here. Truly a wonderful staff and as a trainer, I get to teach others how to do their job well. It is increasingly rewarding."
good,"I worked at chilis for a little over a year before I moved. I wish I could have stayed. The enviroment was very welcoming and everyone there were friends. It was a very fun and joking group of employees and managers. The managers were VERY good though, they listen to their employees concerns, they make sure everyone is getting equal tables, they help servers, togo, and hosts when needed. The managers went above and beyond just managing... they would be in the back cooking, serving, bussing, etc. The scheduling is very flexible and they're very understanding of mandatory situations. This job can be very fast paced so get ready to hustle on weekends or summertime! They are really helpful of new people, you won't feel lost and too worn out. I would recommend this job to anyone whose outgoing, ready to hustle, and make money. Its a great place to work while in school or not. You can make friends and money while having respectful, caring, managers."
good,"I absolutely love working for this company and never want to leave. It is my first job I’ve ever had and I never want to leave. My location specifically, everyone is really friendly and helpful and upbeat. I’ve talked to others who work in different locations and they say the same or similar things. It’s fast paced on weekend nights, slow and steady week day lunches. If you want a great tempory/part time job, I would 100% recommend Chili’s."
good,"​Provided superior customer service, including but not limited to, promptly and warmly greeting and acknowledging guests upon arrival; efficiently and with complete knowledge of food and beverage menus, accurately obtain guest(s) orders and serve quickly and effectively; merchandise food and beverage meus in an informative, friendly and enthusiastic manner; follow up with guest(s) throughout their visit to ensure customer satisfaction."
good,Chilis is a very busy resturant. The company takes pride in giving 100% of great customer service. The amount of work may feeling overwhelming but the reward which is given by the guest is amazing. I love meeting new guest and building a reltionship with them to make them want to come back.
good,Chili's is a really great restaurant company filled with awesome workers and it's people. Unfortunately the salary pay isn't equal enough to it's job duties.
good,I actually love my job at Chili's. The work environment and work family is very friendly and easy to work with. Everyone is willing to help one another out nk matter the circumstance.
good,If I could go back to working at a Chili's I would. The management in burlington was something to be desired and also lacks a chance for a career advancement.
good,Chili’s is great. The people that come in are generally nice people. Chill vibes. Half off food when you work. Stand for long periods of time and you’re on your feet all day
good,The managers and other team members are fun to work with. it's like agiant family up there. Unfortunately my hours didn't work well with my home life.
good,I learned how to work in a team environment all the time. We are always accountable of helping each other to ensure the guest are happy. Some days were longer than others depending on the business that day.
good,"i am working in chilis since 2014 untill now and i could say that chilis is great restaurant with a good management team ,we had a great teamwork with my colleague ,"
good,I like working at Chili’s it’s fun most of the time. Could use more servers but other then that it’s very laid back busy place to work at. Serving can be hard sometimes with having a lot of tables just have to know and learn how to Multitask and write down everyone order in a fast but steady manner.
good,"Fun place to work, great staff. They offer Flexible scheduling. Most days are busy. Chili’s is by far the cleanest and most organized restaurant I’ve worked in."
good,Loved working with Chili's. It's a culture like no other you are encouraged to be yourself. Great place for first time restaurant workers. Good opportunity for friends as well.

good,"I love working at Chili's. It is a fast-paced, fun environment, and excellent management type place. I would love to stay working at Chili's but I cannot due to the lack of hours I am given."
good,This was a Great place to work while going to school. You’re able to pick up hours or work less hours. The managers were flexible with scheduling. Positive atmosphere
good,"Worked for Chili's for a total of ten years. Great company, but is not evolving with the times. Unfortunately, Chili's is a dying company. I wish they would be able to make it."
good,"i learn so many things about customer service, I was taught to be a full waitress and full of experience, for 4 years you can learn more than I thought"
good,"I loved working for Chili's, and i would love to work for them again. The food was great and the work was plentiful always something to do when down time presented itself. The management was great"
good,i learn how to deal with different kinds of customers.i've learn basic food safety practices & displaying total teamwork.our management keeps us motivated always to be more productive @ work
good,"Flexible hours, worked with me while I finished my final year of college, which made working there more enjoyable.  Good place to work if you are looking for something pretty laid back."
good,Chilis was a fun company to work for. I met one of my best friends in this industry. There are regular promotions and raises and chances to exceed. I worked usually on the weekends (which is most of the times required) but when i asked for more hours I was given more hours.
good,I loved working at Chilis I loved my co-workers and I had the best managers. They were so helpful and knew what they were doing 24/7. It was a fun fast-paced job.
good,"when i left from working at chilis in new york i didnt want to leave because i loved that job, my co workers were amazing the management was awesome and it was sad to leave because chilis was like my second family"
good,"Get to meet new people, learn more about each food and drink, multi tasking between waiter, hosted, bartender, runner and as kitchen staff  and learn on guest review on each type of food and drink"
good,"Chilis can be a great place to work as long as the management is fun to work with. The pace is fast, the pay is decent, and the food is great. It's a great atmosphere to work in, most days. Would definitely recommend."
good,"Never dull with a fast paced environment. Great management and coworkers. Fun, competitive tasks. Fun ways to get to know coworkers. Flexible hours and work many positions."
good,management was great career advancement is something that they very much believe in they hire good people and keep them and train them well to succeed
good,"Handling day to day operations /writing schedules/ Training"
good,Clock in and make sure my area was ready to serve. Manager was awesome and was always hands on with employees. Carrying the trays with a lot of food and drinks on busy days were the hardest.
good,"There are stressful days working at Chili's. Team members try to make each other happy to enjoy the day. Working here has helped me learn organizational skills, time management, and hard working skills. Management has always been a pleasure to work with. The hardest part about the job is dealing with rude guests who think they are always right. The most enjoyable part about the job with working with fun team members to keep each other cheerful."
good,"Una empresa muy ordenada en todos los aspectos, las tareas estaban bien definidas para evitar dañar el buen ambiente laboral que todos los días había. "
good,"Everyday is different wether its a slow steady day or you are slammed and busy. It is a great place to work, you learn alot of skills to help you later on. You meet many different kind of people and you will even have regulars and make a few friends. There are days were you feel overwhelmed but the time goes by quickly when you are busy."
good,From the moment you walk in the door it is an immediate sense of family. So much to say that when you are not there you miss your coworkers and cant wait to see them again. It's as if everyday is a family reunion.
good,I love work in chilis it was fun. I like to serve people and the costumer services. My coworkers are like family and the people was so nice wen they come to restaurant.
good,"It's serving. However, they're focused on making this company a very well-oiled machine. They are very self-aware and keep everyone accountable of they're actions without losing sight on the fact that everyone should have fun and they could be making quite a bit of money doing so. Which was the best part; having money in your pocket every night."
good,"The place is more like family, than work. Everyone is very close and we all help one another, even outside of work. I absolutely love the atmosphere. If you want to serve, make money, and love going to work... Chili's is the place."
good,Serving at Chilis was fun and fast-paced. The Management and crew were very friendly and helpful. They were flexible and willing to work with your personal schedule within reason.

good,i liked working for them. management was great cooks all worked as a team was kept clean and paid great the servers were always doing a great job and worked great with us in the kitchen.
good,"The day consist of a normal operation which was ordering trucks food, inventory, training employee, making the schedule for the week keep the company economically viable."
good,"I worked here for 5 years. I truly enjoyed working as a team. I enjoyed the quick pace and the get it done attitude. Consumers coming into the testurant loved this place. I love the food personally. As a face of the resturant, you make friends and you really get to know people and their habits. Chilis is about building stories. What brings people together is food. Chilis offers such a wide variety that a large group can be accommodated and each individual can have a different selection from the menu."
good,The management is really flexible with your work schedule.  The other employees are welcoming and really awesome people.  They really value teamwork and genuinely care.
good,"Working in this company help me become a good employee, from their training to application is awesome. They help me grow as an employee and gave me a self confidence to be a better employee. I'm dealing with maximum of 200 guests a day, and I was able to handle them because of my good training, hard work and good communication skills."
good,Best managers I have ever had. They move you up if you work hard. They show that they really do appreciate your hard work and it's a relief. Everybody is one big family and looks after each other.
good,"This was a great place to work. The GM was very fair, worked well with staff and I would recommend as a great place to work. I was well trained, treated equally and with respect. A typical day was to set up, assist customers and break down. The culture was average for this establishment and a younger staff.  The hardest part was being so busy the side work took to long. My most enjoyable part was being a team player to give patrons a satisfying experience, overall."
good,"This company has a great background. Their CEO has setup so many wonderful things for you to be able to achieve. You can move up pretty quick if you are good at your job. The majority or the management and higher up are all great. If they are not great then don't get used to them, it will get taken care of. Do not be afraid to talk to your high ups. They will always be willing to help."
good,"Over the last 3 1/2 years, I have worked as a full-time student and a full-time employee. Over the years, not only have I seen growth in myself, but I have seen growth all over the workplace. I was a very shy individual when Chili's decided to give me a chance, and now I blossom with conversation towards anyone who will listen.  My coworkers and my managers have become family. I have never seen a company truly care for their employees like Chili's does. On top of all of that, I work for a company who likes to give back. Whether it be to those who were involved in tragedy, or the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Chili's puts in every effort to extend their hand and their love."
good,I loved my job but I was not being scheduled enough hours. Also they really let you be you they aren't strict at all about tattoos hair color nail color etc.
good,Evalúo a la empresa bastante alta ya que es una empresa que apesar de ser de un salario minimo ayudan a cada empleado a lograr obtener una motivación contínua.
good,My Typical day at work is like. I go in at 8 am to chili's with the opening manger so i can sitting my self up to start mind prep for the day. Then I go see what prep i have to start with and the manger start doing what he/she need to do as will. when i found what i have to do for prep and i will not get done in till all the prep i have to do for that day.
good,I really enjoyed working for Brinker incorporated. They are a really good company who cares about their employees. Shift meals are good and management was awesome
good,I like my job as a cook at chilis but they over work the cooks way more than they should. We don't get paid enough for all the things we have to do on a daily bases. I love cooking and that's what keeps me going here.
good,"I originally took this job as just something to get through college, but it became more than that. Everyone I worked with became a good friend, and I know some of the people I met there will continue to be friends for life."
good,"I worked at the Hamilton chilis, and it was a great experience. Never have I had a better group of management that genuinely cared about their employees and remained professional. The lunch deals make it a little harder to generate a large check average, but working in the evening was definitely worth it."
good,Was one of the best experiences I've had at a job. Made good money and had fun meeeting clientele. Surveys are stressful but force a better performance.

good,Great Place to work. First food industry job learned a lot and had a great team of managers to teach each other.
good,"A typical day at work begins with opening the restaurant, usually it is fairly simple and if possible I dont mind assisting servers with side work. During peak hours it sometimes gets hectic but never to the point where control has been lost. What ive learned is that you have to carefully strategize the amount and sizes of tables going to each section so that my co workers all have a chance to make enough money. Management is very helpful and will step in to assist anyone in need, many times a member of management will step up and assist the host if the door becomes too crowded, lessening the pressure on the host and speeding up the process making the guest more comfortable and making sure they are satisfied. Co-workers are always helpful and understanding. The hardest part is when we are slow and everyone is frustrated for tables so they can make money but everyone is calm and collected and issues are quickly sorted out. The most enjoyable part are the reviews from our guests and knowing that every single employee is an integral part to excellent customer service."
good,"A typical day of work would be serving the customers, learned to be efficient in serving customers in a restaurant, management was very good in handling the staffs, co-workers were very friendly, hardest past was keeping up with the food flow and the fast pace.

Management was always very good about accommodating employees needs and requests.  Co-workers not always got along but for the most part everybody was able to get along to get the job done and provide an enjoyable experience.  I really enjoyed getting to meet new people and interacting with people that I would never normally meet,  Working at a fast pace and being able to multitask fit me very well and I was able to excel wherever I was placed.

Only complaint is that it’s impossible to get a raise, unless it’s state or corporate mandated. But it’s a pretty good job, if you work full time, the benefits are good."

good,"There is never a dull day at Chili's. Each team member adds their own spice to the work environment, making it fun and easier to get through the days. I have had excellent experiences with every one of the team members and managers, and have really gotten to know a lot about them personally because  everyone is working so close with each other.

good,Chilis es una marca internacional bien posicionada en mexico. Cuenta con el respaldo de un gran corporativo como es CMR. Chilis tiene estándares de trabajo muy bien definidos y su cultura de trabajo fue permeada a todos los restaurantes del grupo CMR. Chilis te exige a tu máximo y saca lo mejor de ti para resolver problemas y dar la mejor experiencia a sus clientes y trabajadores. El corporativo tiene muchas areas de oportunidad y le falta mayor sensibilidad en apoyo a la operación.
good,"I love working at Chillis. The people are very nice and help every associate in the best way. Management is very laid back and friendly but also make sure everything is going well. The hardest part of the job are some of the customers but that is every job.

The most enjoyable part of the job is the environment and associates. There is no competing for anything, just a pleasant work environment."

good,"What really sold me on working here was my co workers. They were all great, helpful, nice, I can go on forever! The work as a server or host could be very stressful and busy, as guests could get angry, rude, or impatient. It was worth it though to work with the great people I worked with, and the nice guests I met along the way. Sadly the Chili's I worked at closed and the other ones are too far but I would work there again in a heart beat."
good,"From the first day at the job I automatically felt welcomed by all of the staff and management-- it was like one big family. Being a hostess there were periods of time where it was extremely slow, and we were allowed to hang out and have fun, but we all knew how to be serious and efficient when any lunch/dinner rushes happened. The management was fantastic and the servers were awesome. Highly recommend!"
good,"preparing food orders appetizers  main courses sides and deserts, stocking station, helping other stations, crew atmosphere, cleaning . a lot of frying"
good,The manages are amazing the are very easy to get along with super professional. Staff in the kitchen have been there for many years so they know pretty good what they are doing. its a fast paced kind of job but it goes by fast with all the cooking you do. Its definitely not for someone who likes to work slow or do very little for herself or others its a team effort.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of me opening the kitchen and the front of the house in the restaurant to begin our day as chili's servers. we greet guests and give them an experience they wont forget, and at the end of the day we close the restaurant and make sure that the building maintains a clean and healthy environment to policy standards."
good,Working at chili's has been great! The management staff really knows how to treat their employees. Scheduling is really flexible and it works well with my families schedule.
good,"This was a good job. The only bad things about it were the other employees were a little too nosey about your personal life, and the management would not give you time off even if you requested off months in advance and your life depended on it."
good,"A typical day at work is very faced paced and exciting, as soon as you clock in, you're thrown into the mix. I've learned how to be more social as well as more team-oriented. The management team is a very supportive group that is always there to help. The hardest part of the job just so happens to be the most enjoyable part of the job,  which is serving our guests. You never know what kind of person they are or what kind of mood they could be in. It's a difficult thing to deal with guests that may have an abrasive or aggressive personality, but that makes having them leave with a smile so much more satisfying."
good,"Have worked at Chili's for over 10 years. Great place with flexibility for schedules. Benefits are decent, but no vacation hours anymore. Took those away back in like 2012. Corporate managers are always changing things, sending out specials and coupons to keep people coming in. Unfortunately guests have become more cheap and disrespectful over time.  Overall the pay is good and flexibility makes it easy to have time for school, family, projects, or vacations."
good,I been working in kitchens for almost 10 years. Mainly line cook but have plenty of experience frying and grilling and sauteing as well looking for a new job preferably not grave yard
good,"I High recommend working at Chili's . It is a productive, safe, and fun environment. The coworkers and management is Lovely and you get to improve your social skills."

good,"En lo personal, aprendí mucho sobre las ventas, sobre la importancia del trabajo en equipo, a trabajar bajo presión, excelente empleo para superación en general."
good,"A typical day when complaint received from guest. "
good,"Chilis is a company that provides you the opportunity to be the best in every station. The managers are extremely flexible with the employees and always be sure of having all the tools necessary for the job. Every day they have two staff meeting (am/pm) for motivate all the employees. The most enjoyable part is been part of the team, be capable to teach others, to have the confidence of my bosses."
good,"All Co workers were very nice and outgoing it was a very great fit in , I enjoyed the fast paced environment , the procedures are very lenient and easy going"
good,I liked working at Chili's it was a nice place I got along with the other co-workers. The manager there where nice and cool one of the manager left I got along with her.

good,"Management  was very nice and caring , A typical day at work consists of helping guests as they come into the restaurant. As a hostess I greeted guests, sat them, and helped my coworkers when necessary. On your feet a lot ."
good,Working as a server is not an easy job. I have been serving for three years and have learned a lot although its not a business i want to stay part of due to the amount of stress on a typical shift. Hardest part of the job is being at ten places in one time. The most enjoyable part is the intelligent conversations daily with some co workers or customers.
good,"Great, clean environment. Kind employers and understanding managers. Chili's is a fast and friendly place to work. Unfortunately I had to leave due to my scheduling not lining up with my school schedule and I was not able to get it changed."
good,"They stay up to date with trends and technology, keep current with ""flavors of the week"" and are always participating in competitions to keep employees competitive yet ambitious during shifts. Waiting tables is a pain in any establishment, but Chilis really does their best to take care of the staff."
good,"Working in the food service industry is tough because the schedule is all over the place and can be taxing, but the people I worked with and the management did a great job at making everyday fun and worked with scheduling as best they could."
good,I made some of my best friends at Chillis! I made great money and had a relatively flexible schedule. The hardest part was working nights and weekends which caused me to miss out on many family events and activities.
good,"i improve my skills"
good,"Chilis is a really fun and positive job environment for workers and you always have something to do. It is really busy during the weekends, so you are always making good tips and time flies by fast."
good,Working in Chili's can be a bit difficult at times. But overall this a great job. Co-workers and staff both are amazing. I would have to say the hardest part of my day would be dealing with upset customers. The happiest part of my day would be dealing with customers and being able to put a smile on their face.
good,"Increíble ambiente, aparte de ser una empresa en crecimiento."
good,"Chilis es exactamente como en ningun otro lugar"
good,"The enjoyable part of the job is whenever there's a rush time in the store, we always work together as a team to have a smooth operation."
good,"My job is very easy and my requirements are the same every day. I know what every day is going to be like and going into work I know that I will have a fun day. I am a hostess so I answer the phone, take reservations and seat people who come in the door! The atmosphere at work is awesome. My co workers and the management is great. They are all friendly and they are very understanding and get along very well. I would say the hardest part of the job is the busy weekends. People get very upset with you if you tell them your wait time is long. The most enjoyable part is the people. I love the interaction I get with the friendly customers and my co workers are just awesome!"
good,Working as a team with another server in a section is great. Shifts were constantly busy. I feel like guests go through their beverages very quickly...not like any other place I've been. I enjoyed my co-workers and the environment of Chili's.
good,"It's a very upbeat place to work, love the annual softball tournament, they hold give back nights for local organizations. The yealy proceed donation to St Jude Charity. "
good,Here 3 months so far. I began as a host and have moved into the back of the house to get more hours. Servers must love it here because it seems there will be no openings in that area possible any time soon.
good,I loved working here. The management and coworkers were my favorite part of it. They made work fun. The hours were great and so was the money. I learned how to go from a small restaurant to a larger restaurant in a matter of days. The training I received was exceptional.

good,I've learned a lot in my current position. Highly enjoy the fast paced and ever changing environment.  Most enjoyable part of the day was working with our guests and colleagues. The hardest part would be the struggle between keeping an effective work and personal life balance due to the hours required.
good,I learned to follow instructions administration and respect for the laws and work as a team work and respect for working hours.
good,A great way to show customer service skills and to manage different situations with the public. Managing and balancing cash drawers and working together as a team.
good,"Had a lot of contest , would still be there if i could, loved the management and the co workers, great family fun but at the same time it was for a date night or quick business lunch"
good,Nice casual restaurant to make friends both with coworkers and customers. It's a good springboard to other concepts. It's too bad the concept is nearly failing.

I learned a lot of communication and cash handling skills. My managers were always very fun, friendly, sociable, and had a professional manner about them. My coworkers were all extremely kind and after awhile it felt more like working with family members and it was great. The hardest part of the job was when it was a holiday and we had no opportunity to earn money. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with."
good,"Co-workers and management always kept you busy with fun ways to keep you motivated. Felt like a close nit family, and was always busy helping new faces and new found friends."

good,"When working at the chilis i worked in every second mattered, there wasn't a moment were you could skip a beat. We as a team worked a 6-million dollar restaurant and all our ticket times were less the 7 Minutes! TEAMWORK was our game, no matter what the challenge we worked and struggled through it together. I am all about TEAM, it makes or breaks your attitude."
good,"I worked a lot of doubles. I learned a different computer system, how to make bar drinks, and different style of Mexican food. Management was amazing. My co-workers were fun passionate,and hard working. The hardest was learning the computer system and bar drinks. I loved dealing with our  customers and getting to know them on a one on one level."
good,"It was a lot to do its just not just tables but a lot of them and even more with we were so busy on weekend nights. I learned when I go to a restaurant now and I see bussers bussing I know how it feels. The co-workers were great. The hardest part of it was the weekends when  we where so busy! The best of it though was, you can eat for free on your shift."

Yes, there are also times where we have to deal with an upset guest. I've always tried to make sure that they don't leave unhappy. We don't always accomplish that, but we do our best to make it happen."
good,A typical day at work was about an 8-10 hr. shift. Depending on the schedule I did an array of jobs for this company. I was always eager to learn something new something new. I was a cocktail server/Quality Assistance/ Sever/Hostess and /To Go. The hardest part of the job was just the constant standing and never slowing down. I do not recommend this job if you are injured in anyway.
good,"Llegar temprano y che car todo lo que ase falta para comenzar un buen día de trabajo."
good,Productive fast paced team oriented easy fun job it almost felt like it was not work .

good,"Bartending at Chili's was an enjoyable job filled with lots of responsibility and hard work. As a bartender, time management, sales, product knowledge, customer service and safe alcohol skills were the things I focused on the most. I was responsible for dealing with people from all walks of life and making sure they had a wonderful Chili's experience every time they came into the restaurant. I was in charge of making all drinks for servers and for my bar guests, keeping the bar clean and free of any potential hazards, attending meetings, promoting new product, setting an example to my fellow employees, handling money, training new employees and practicing safe alcohol service. I had to work side by side with my managers on a day to day basis, and form a trusting relationship with them. The hardest part of my job was being aware of all of my customers' levels of intoxication when I had more than twenty people at the bar at the same time. The most enjoyable part of my job was getting to meet people from all walks of life and giving them an unforgettable Chili's experience."

You must be very good at multitasking, memorization, and keep your composure when the restaurant gets really busy.Co-workers are from all ages, everyone has a great attitude. The hardest part of the job is learning to prioritize when you are busy. The most enjoyable part is building relationships with clients and offering the best in service."

good,Chili's has a menu to please the Tax Mex appetite. Lots of contests to win extras.Chilis has partner oriented service. I have worked at several locations.

Quarterly thing change and hard to keep track with which focus was most important when it was all over the map."

good,"Conocimientos en alimento"
good,"Chilis bar and grill dishwashers and portion prep usually begin with setting up your area either to prep your food or to organize and set your dishes. The job is usually stressful yet positive. The experience you gain includes teamwork, communication, creativity and assertiveness. Chilis maintains a positive and empathetic environment for its guests and its employees. The hardest part of the job is keeping pace. The times enjoyed most were conversing and working with the co-workers."
good,"Loved this company!  Only left due to personal reasons...many opportunities for advancement, great culture, strong relationships through out company, tons of support, great training.  I would highly recommend Chilis to anyone seeking to enter management or further their management career.  Never a slow moment but with great systems and focus you can obtain goals, hit  bonus, and create a good quality of life.  Definitely a team atmosphere where respect and drive to be the best are apparent in daily ops.  Loved the focus on team members and the fact that you were encouraged to think outside the box!"
good,I always felt safe and felt like I was a part of a family at Chilis. It really is a good place to work and you can have good hours and make pretty good money. I loved working at Chilis.
good,"I have no problems with Chili's. I loved my manager and my crew members. This job put me into an apartment and I'm able to pay rent, lights, and WiFi. I have a very high cost of living just for me, so $600-$700 paychecks aren't enough. I would go salary based but they barely make enough to deal with all the mess they deal with. My advice, don't become a server. If you become a bartender, put less juice in the drinks. If you do ToGo, that's the best job there besides a line cook."
good,"I worked at Chilis all four years that i was in college and it helped me financially to afford all of my bills on my own ($1,500 a month). Mangers are nice and if you love to travel its easy to request off and have off as much as needed."
good,"Very fast paced envirnoment, fruiendly co-workers, managers are great and willimng to work wioth people's schedules. Hardest part is when the crowd comes in and are hungry. We try to get them seated in a timely fashion,but sometimes it does require a waiting list. "
good,"Trabajo arduo día a día"
good,"Chilis was my second job and i have been with them a while. I loved working with them, they are flexible with my schedule and understand all there employee."
good,I loved working for this company! They always took care of me. It is a restaurant with restaurant drama but you are gonna find that everywhere. It is a great place to work!
good,Good place to work if you are full of energy you will make good tips but you have to be up beat. If you looking to have fun wild you working this is the place to go.

good,"i loved working for Chili's, the management team and crew members were very welcoming and always willing to help. Management always provided feedback that offered ways to improve my job performance."
good,"Productive, fun & fast paced. Out of the jobs I have had , Chili's was my favorite. I planned to be there until I got done with college but I had to move, I was super sad."
good,Out of all the serving jobs I have had chili’s was the best. It had an awesome atmosphere with all of the employees and management team. They worked with your availability Incase  you have school or another job.
good,"As a server/bartender, the amount of money kind of depends on you. My most recent location was just in a terrible area, with very bad tippers, and what people leave you isn't something you can control. Depending on the area you're in, you CAN make very good money. The first location I worked was great, management was always on your side and willing to work with your availability. You get to meet a lot of new people and make friends for a lifetime, not just your coworkers, but regulars turned friends."
good,"I worked for chili’s between the months of October and January, it was a fast paced work environment, and occasionally it got stressful, but I made good friends and learned great social skills"
good,Service was provided to the guest with the exception of management sometimes being rude and I thought for sure that certain area could have been improved with minor adjustments
good,"If you work hard and do your job correctly, it is all very rewarding. My GM is family to me as well as most of my co workers. Once you get comfortable its a great place to work for."

good,"I learned a lot in my whole experiences.I will keep it as my key in my future life with you ,Azadea .Being a good customer service will satisfy the need of your guest/customer."
good,Everyone had their duties to perform. I learned how to effectively use a dishwasher and clean/ put away all dishes and utensils. The only difficult part of the job was being on my feet constantly with minimal breaks.
good,Chilis is a great job for some extra money. Great people work there and it is fun. You can make decent money on busy days. 50% off as a worker for any chilis facility. Thats the best part !!
good,"was a fun place to work,good co workers,good food,excelent benefits,meeting good people,long hours but good salary,over all good place to work,good activities"

good,"I liked working for Chilis.  I would have kept working here had corporate not frozen all pay raises.  Other than the problems with lack of raise opportunities, it was a great place to work."
good,Chili’s is a great corporation to work for! I highly recommend it. I was a host and sometimes it was very stressful but it was also fun getting to be in charge of where to sit people and getting to help the servers.
good,"I enjoyed my years as a chili head. Great management, benefits ranging from health to dental and even annual sports competitions. Staff and guests function well to deliver a great experience for all ranges."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of writing down your Goals for the day, a team meeting before you started and serving Guests. I learned how to host, serve, expedite and to-go. Management was Great, upbeat and positive. The hardest part of the job was working in the Bar/Lounge area because Guests sat themselves and sometimes it got a little overwhelming. However, fellow Chili Heads and Management would always help out. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people everyday."
good,"Chili's was my first real job and probably one of my favorites. The work wasn't hard. The entire staff had fun while staying professional and providing the best service possible. All of my managers were professional and supportive. The discounts on food were great, and there was always opportunity for advancement."
good,We worked as a team and but also had fun with our guests and other co-workers. Great management. Hot and fast food presentation and just an overall happy work environment.
good,"Loved the job, great management and great benefits. Learned a lot about people development and how to coach individual team members  and not just hands and feet. Helped build a culture of great team members."
good,very fast pace job but I love working here we all work as a team and get the job done. management is amazing and so is walking out with a good amount of money.
good,I love my job at Chili's. We are one big family. The management and other staff members are easy to get a long with and everyone is very friendly. The job itself is quick-paced and can be very stressful at times. Overall it is worth it.

good,"Workers were very friendly and welcoming. Very delightful and diverse music, discounts on food were good as well. The manager was very flexible with hours and willing to work with you school schedule."
good,Great first job. Learned how important urgency was in the work force. Had flexible hours which allowed me to do well in school while still working enough hours.
good,"9 working hours for employees daily. I learned so many things from the company from my position as a host then promoted as a food server to food server trainer. I learned the company's goal to increase profit and sales and to give the excellence food and service to the guest beyond their expectations.I learned the product lifecycle of the items and the company's brand standards.As a food server (trainer) I am a part of the management team,I used to make schedules for the team members, I used to conduct a classroom meeting with the staff, communication with the guests/regular guest,attending seminars/meetings with the operations and training coordinator."
good,"Excelente empresa, oportunidad de crecimiento  salario aceptable."
good,"The general manager always worked with me in regards to my medical problems, and that will always be the main factor that makes or breaks a job for me."
good,"llegabas "
good,"i learn how to work followin the stander,how to coaching the new team members, how to respect the suppliers,team work,love and enjoy your work and improve your self."
good,"El clima laboral de la empresa era muy bueno había comunicación constante , el staff gerencial incluyéndome tratábamos a todos por igual y cuando algo era incorrecto se hablaba y se solucionaba el problema. Chilis fue una empresa de la que aprendi mucho profesionalmente"

good,It was fun working their meet new people everyday learn something new everyday i loved being at work.Stay working managers love to see improvement in their employers
good,"Chili's is a great place to work, I learned a lot in this company,i learn learn how important the sanitation when handling foods. that's why it is important to us to wash our hand before entering the kitchen and when handling from one food to another. our management is giving all we need in the kitchen for us to be more productive and to serve the guest as fast as we could, but in right timing from appetizer to dessert. One thing  that I enjoy on this Job is when we are having so many guest but we still be able to give them the right timing and Quality food that they expect. and that is because our kitchen is having a Good communication on each other."
good,Working here was a lot of fun. I enjoyed getting to meet new people everyday and hearing about things going on in their lives while giving them the best service possible. The management team here is very friendly and family oriented when they scheduled work. They where extremely accommodating to anything that came up with my child either at school or personally. Management made the employees feel like they were part of a team and made you feel that your input was very important in the decisions they made on a daily basis. While working here i learned to be an expert at multi-tasking due to all the different situations that come up daily working in the restaurant business. Working here even helped me become better organized and more aware of peoples needs in my daily life. I would highly recommend working here to anyone.
good,"Learning the importance of customer service. Management is professional. Fun workplace and is willing to work with your schedule. Overall great place to work,"
good,"I worked at Chili's as a To-go cashier. This means I would take orders either over the phone, in person orders, or online orders. I would bag the food, check with the customer to make sure it was made the way they wanted it, and I would check them out. In my free time I would work the Q.A line. This means I would put orders together for the restaurant on try's, making sure the orders were correct. I would also deliver the food for the server if they were busy. I also would help the hostess in my free time. I tried to keep my self busy. My philosophy is that if your standing around and not working then you should not be getting paid."
good,was always busy and training was great and enjoyed every moment of it. its a personal choice and was worth the train and hard work i put in.
good,"The reason I loved working at chilis was because it was like family, everyone helped anyone in need.  It was always a fun day at work. The hardest part of the job for me was getting real busy with a lot of food tickets. "
good,"Overall an amazing job with extensive flexibility. Not much change in the typical workday which i preferred, easier to keep track of the fast pace environment."
good,A typical day at work is very steady paste but gets budy during a certain period of time that i can handle. I learned that it's not how good you Are at what you do its how fast you can keep up and maintain the pressure. The management is very professional and organized and my co-workers are very helpful and guides me too strive for more and that's exactly what I'm going to do. The hardest part about working there is just at the end of my shift all the dishes comes to me all at once and I'm there with out another dishwasher too help. The most thing i enjoy though i would say is the team work .
good,"Loved working with the amazing management and coworkers.never made me feel like i was less than family. always willing to help and teach if you didnt understand something, always helpful and underestanding"
good,Being a host was a very on the go job. I was always on my feet and always back and forth seating people and helping servers out. All in all I really enjoyed helping people.
good,"Great pay, flexible scheduling, and it was a great working environment. They has a great culture in place. The company mostly promotes from within."
good,"- lots of multitasking "
good,"Everything about chili's was awesome. I miss it all the time. The food, the energy and the leadership was outstanding. Never a slow shift and never a Friday or Saturday night that didn't end up somewhere fun after work. If you can handle high volume corporate stores this is a no brainer."
good,The job was fun and working there but some employees should not of been there the management had let things go to far with no discipline so i had to leave.
good,"A very fun place to work at, great management team. you have to be hard working to get the job done and being able to talk to people without being shy."
good,"Chili's is a place to learn new things and experience the real culture of your area. I began 9 years ago with no experience with anything restaurant related, and even a very shy and reticent demeanor. Well they fixed me right up! Now, I am an outgoing leader in my field that is not afraid to give direction and constructive criticism to individuals who need it. Wow, how things have changed...but, I digress. At Chili's, there are many opportunities for personal growth, as well as jobs that have quite a bit of security. The ecosystem here is reminiscent of a large extended family. Everyone is in tune wth each other, and even though there may be squabbles occasionally, we are all like sisters and brothers. I love it here!"
good,"Excelente ambiente desde que entrabas, desde el cafesito gratis con los compañeros, el comer y compartir juntos la hora de comer, la gente que te daban propinas generosas en sus rachas de buena suerte."
good,there are a lot of good things about working in chili's there a lot of good code worker the hours are not to bad and they try and help you as much a they can
good,Chili's is a great place to work. This was a face paced restaurant. This is a nice place to eat. Great food and amazing servers. Management can use some help.
good,"I started as a server. I became one of the best and most reliable. I was then trained as a Trainer, and a Bartender. I loved this job. I made quite a few regulars who I still keep in contact with."
good,"Didnt work there long, but was taught everything within a fast pace. I was glad to beable to get to work by myself so quickly."
good,"I liked the job the managers were nice,they helped if you needed help they understood if you needed something everyone really worked together everyone knew how to do there job."
good,"Chili's is an amazing place to work. Ability to move up in terms of money, great staff, and very flexible for scheduling."
good,"Managers were always there when needed, coworkers were friendly, dining benefits after a few months of working. The friendly environment made going to work enjoyable, even on busy nights. Sundays are a hit or miss, never know if it'll be busy."
good,"This was my very first job and I will always love this place! Great people, great management, great everything! I definitely have nothing bad to say about this job. I would definitely take this job back without a doubt in my mind!"
good,"Working for Chili's was an amazing expierence; I made good friends and had strong, trusted bonds with my managers and my co workers. I learned a lot about customer service and teamwork and the most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with all of the friendly customers that entered the store."
good,The most enjoyable part of my previous job was greeting customers and tendig to their needs. At this job I developed great customer service and interpersonel skills.
good,"I deal with the general public daily, I am a people person and enjoy my job very much. Our managers keep us on our toes by creating contests and new ways to increase productivity."
good,Typical day at work is coming in to a lot of orders soon as you get clocked on. I have  learned how to manage and get through hard times. Learning how to work with others and communicating as a team you can accomplish anything.
good,"Loved my coworkers and the cliental but the management was horrible, I ended up leaving because of it. I loved that it was fast paced, I was always busy. Chilis taught me a lot about team work."
good,"great people, co workers become like a family. The managers handle the restraint like we are a team which is really cool. Everybody helps each other out."
good,I could open and close the restaurant by working my way up to a key employee. I love to meet new people and brighten up their day. I gain did a lot of manager duties here as well as make the FOH schedule for about 30 employees. Trying to keep everyone happy was never easy.
good,"I really enjoy working at Chili's.  Although the routine is pretty much the same, outcomes are not, but they are mostly positive.  I learned how to adapt to many different outcomes with Chili's. You could have some guests who are very happy with their service and some who are not, but I learned how to keep a level head.  Management and Chili's is amazing!!!  The managers not only want you to do your job, but they are always there to talk to you, and will help you with basically any situation.  Work or non work related.  My co workers are extremely helpful.  They are easy to get along with, and we have developed friendships  We know we are all like one family, because we all work together.  I think the hardest part of my job is just to try to make every customer happy, especially at a busy time.  I really do not like putting people on a wait, but sometimes when the restaurant is filled to the max, you give them every alternative, and whenever they are very assistant of what they want, you have to sometimes have them wait.  They get nasty to you, and yell at you in front of other customers, but that is rare.  I have only had one incident when that happened, and only because she was hungry and tried to get under my skin, but I kept telling her alternatives of where else she could sit."
good,It was very beneficial and was a great experience. The establishment was very good in giving directions and orders. The workers were very nice and helpful.
good,great place to work and meet new people. awesome contest and had fun with guests. co workers are fun to work with. manager is a very respectable person. he always takes others feelings into consideration. We all help each other in every way possible.
good,"The managers were kind, understanding and knew how to create a positive and profitable work environment. I was trained expertly and created many life long friends and acquaintances from the store. When you did a good job at Chili's, you were rewarded and made to feel accomplished. During my career I achieved a nearly full dollar raise by the time I had to leave due to a necessary surgery. Store was clean,wonderful atmosphere. Free food was given during split shifts and 50 percent discounts were given to employees and family/friends. The hardest part of the job was probably the physical lifting ( as I am small female) but it was definitely managable and any employee or manager would help whenever needed."
good,A typical day at work consist of assiyting customer in to having the best dine in exprience. I wil do my best and even go out of my way to have all my customers satisfied. You meet new people all the time it is fun and time goes by so fast.
good,"The typical day is hectic yet enthusiastic! working with all levels of employees from hosts to management, the staff really does their best to make sure that guests receive amazing service.  Working for Chili's I learned not only how to handle money, food and beverage; but I learned what it was like to take on responsibility and how to achieve customer satisfaction.  Management at Chili's is amazing! They are so insightful and knowledgeable about their product, staff, and guests, which creates a positive and educational work environment.  ""Co-workers"" is not what I would call the staff of Chili's, they are more like a family, everyone is so kind and helpful that its like working with friends all day every day! The hardest part about working for any restaurant is the inconsistent pay and scheduling, just when you think you have it figured out, you're wrong. In the end though you enjoy going to work."
good,I portioned food of varies from day to day one day I could be doing ship one day and the next I could be doing Alfredo sauce. Internship
good,Great business where work ethic and personality can be rewarded with great pay and satisfaction.  Fun and friendly work environment
good,"Love the company but to bad they closed in Oregon."
good,"Good, friendly atmosphere. Great management. Great coworkers. Everyone brings a positive attitude to the work place. Makes for an easier work day. Requires lots of patience though due to guests unpleasant service at times."
good,very good job fun atmosphere with excellent food standards.i learned a lot by working at this company.i love the bacon ranch quesadilla
good,it was a hardworking job to do but it made me happy in the end. the only problem was that chili's was short staffed so if having had more employees the shifts would've been less stressful with less amount of quantity of food to have. the amount of food per receipe to prepare was sometimes a challenge but worth the work in the end to know that you can overcome a big demand required of you and to perform it day after day. I feel working at chili's helped teach me essiental receipes that I could use at other food establishments as well. ive learned a lot and thankful that .
good,The management here is outstanding. the short time i worked there i learned more than all the fast food work I've done. These people know how to keep people happy.
good,I come into work and I am always greeted by one of managers and asked how I am. My section partners are fantastic and helpful. Management is incredibly supportive and helps everyone to be the best Chilihead that they can be. The hardest part of my job is the organization of Aloha and the most enjoyable part of my job is meeting new people.
good,"el clima laboral que se respira es como en ningun otro lugar"
good,"I wish I could have continued to work for this company. From corperate management to coworkers everyone was friendly, understanding, and helpful. Easily the best company I have ever worked for."
good,"A typical day at work has two hours of really fast paced dish-washing, keeping up with the restaurant can be a challenge, but has it's benefits when done well. This job requires problem solving, organizational, and time management skills. Patience is key during the days when the dinner rush seems constant. Going the extra mile when cleaning pays off. The management team is a blast to work with. The hardest part of the job would have to be the busyness of the weekend shifts, and the physical exhaustion. The most enjoyable part was working with a bunch of friendly people who keep the environment light and at ease."
good,"restauran con ambiente de trabajo excelente la gerencia sse preocupa por que salgas adelante y de tus necesidades, los compañeros te ayudan con las labores en general es una empresa divertida preocupada x sus trabajadores"
good,"yo evaluo a esta empresa como una de las mejores en capacitación de personal ya que entre sin saber absolutamente nada de su menú y me capacitaron muy bien una vez fui a pedir trabajo a un hotel 5 estrellas muy reconocido aquí en monterrey y por mi experiencia y capacidad casi me contrataron pero tuve un problemilla con la papelería y no me pude quedar y cuentan con entrenadores certificados por área."
good,"Chilis is far the best experience for a first job, they are flexible with schedules and willing to understand that school is important as well and try to accommodate your needs."
good,"A typical work day for me here is great. I love it and it's way better than my previous job (Tenda Chick). I love the culture most of all as well as the people. I come in the morning sometimes during the week where I get things started for the day. At night it's very hectic because I have to deal with a lot of parties but other than that I love it! My co-workers are very friendly, well most of them and they are very kind to me. My most enjoyable part about my job would happen to be interacting with the people. The hardest part is....there's no hard part for me because I like challenges."
good,What I liked most about Chili's is being able to transfer to any Chili's if I had to move cities. The management was always extremely helpful to the staff by running food and drinks etc. Chili's taught me everything I know about interacting with customers and hospitality. Last but not least the staff was about working as a team to create the best experience for the guest.
good,Chilis has a great management team and really cares for there employees.   i use to Be non stop moving all the time witch made the days go by faster. I had good relationships with my co workers and never showed up late. I use to enjoy the customers the most.
good,aprendi el manejo de estandares americanos para el servicio como para la limpieza
good,At Chili's I developed relationships that will last a lifetime.
good,"-Typically, deal with guests are come into the restaurant to enjoy a relaxing and warming experience at Chili's."
good,"Everyday I would come in 10-15 minutes prior to my shift beginning to begin setting myself up for success. Once the night began to get increasingly busy, it became highly important to remain calm and help keep other co-workers calm as well. I put together the presentation of the meals according to how the ticket was assigned. The hardest part of the job was probably the extremely late nights, given I was still in high school. The management made it well worth it though when they would bring in surprises for all of our hard work."
good,A typical work day would consist of starting with a prep list for the front of house.  As well as having a meeting with all of our co-workers.  The hardest part of the job is n to making a guest happy because it is a trickle down effect.  As far as front the kitchen to the front of the house.  The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting a plethora of cultures on a day to day basis and hearing their stories.
good,"It didn't matter what day it was, we were always busy. I rapidly grew in the company, from togo to host, server, bartender, expediter in the kitchen, to a trainer. The management was always understanding."
good,"Es un trabajo la cual te da la facilidad de trabajar y estudiar."
good,I managed all guests orders and made sure service was alway to their expectations. I usually exceeded expectations.
good,Chili's was a great place to work. I learned a lot in customer service and how to work well with the public. I also learned management skills and how a restaurant operates on a daily basis. This was a great learning experience!
good,I am a very fast learner and a great listener. i am looking to work in a fast yet steady work place with enough work to keep me busy. I am a reliable and creative worker.
good,This Job Was Wonderful Great Co-workers Great Customers Management Was A Little Stressful But Overall They Were Great . I Enjoyed Every Part Of The Job Never Complained About Anything.
good,"Great place, great people, and a great environment. Co-workers are helpful. Management is there if you need something. Very busy, attentive for b.o.h prepare meals according to guests standards with a certain time length."
good,"Everyday I go to work with my mind ready for anything to happen. I realized that serving customers at the tables is not always about doing my job right. I discovered that working as a team with my partner is what makes great experiences for the customers. Whenever I need help with my transactions, customized food, or anything else my managers and other staff all help out to solve my problems. I always feel welcome every time I walk in the door ready to clock in. And with everyone saying ""Hi"" and ""Hello"" really set my mind-set ready for work. I learned that great work is not great ""I"". I believe in teamwork."
good,I loved this job! If I didn't have to move back to the States I would have stated at this job forever! It was like a little family! Everybody looked out for each other! I worked for the 2nd busiest Chili's in the world so at times we would get very busy!! But teamwork pushed us through it.
good,"Tube muy buenas capacitaciones , y gracias a eso despues de dos meses fuy capacitadora para los de nuevo igreso valoraban tu trabajo y te apoyaban en tu problemas si estaban es sus manos claro, trabaje muy agusto"
good,i would come in in the morning and have a list of food we had to do. once we were done we could clean up and leave.
good,I love working at Chili's.  I am just looking for a different opportunity.
good,Dailey we worked on shifts serving guests as they came in.  Usually pretty busy and high pressure to keep organized.as you created a great experience for the guests.  I learned how to suggestively sell products as well as how to train and coach fellow team members on learning the best parts of the job.  I learned how to train on a corporate level with bigger corporate wide rollouts etc.
good,"A typical day at work would be a few dinner rushes and cleaning the floors and busing tables, but most importantly working as a team. I learned how to lead a team and run the front of a restaurant. The management was great and my co-workers were fun and friendly! The hardest part of my job was to keep up with the wait list while people who are waiting to be seated were getting impatient. The most enjoyable part of my job was to make the guest experience a great time and to see them walk out with a smile on their faces. "
good,Definitely gets busy on weekends! But the crew handles it. Each day is different. You never know what to expect! The best part of the job is the friends you make. The worst part of the job is having to deal with ridiculous customers.
good,"Estar en el trabajo como un día normal no es difícil va dependiendo que día sea, de todos modos tienes que hacer las tareas que te correspondan...Lo que aprendí fue ...bueno como estudie gastronomía aprendí mucho acerca de las temperaturas..como se acomoda la mercancía,las verduras,como mantener limpio las áreas de trabajo, el orden que tiene que llevar el platillo, etc. Mis compeñeros bueno trabaje con señoras mas grandes que yo ,son buenas ,son muy trabajadoras y algunas si me dieron su apoyo ,la parte mas difícil eran los dias festivos como el 10 de mayo y dia del padre....la parte lo k mas me gusto fue trabajar en equipo..  "
good,Great Service we have the buts staff. your welcome from the moment you step in.the food arrived promptly and always pleasing on the eye and delicious  
good,"Good management, good opportunities for promotion, excellent motivation from your team."
good,It was a great place to work when I was young. I wanted to go on and do better things as I was entering college years. I didn't have much time with working and school.
good,This was my first job and it taught me how use my people skills to the max. It was a great environment and the people I worked with were delightful.
good,"At Chili's my shifts were never boring. It was the first restaurant job I had, and I learned there is always something to do. Something could always be cleaned or a customer's day could be improved simply by my attitude. For the first few days I was shy, but the staff quickly helped me overcome the fear by giving advice and helping me learn more effiecient ways to perform my duties."
good,"Chili's is a really great place to work, but I'm trying to advance my career"
good,Great place to help you get through college. Helpful co workers and managers. Productive and felxible shifts. Great vibe from co workers and guests.
good,"A pretty standard serving job, and my first by title. I first opened another location in Vegas and then transferred to the one closer. I got a lot of my bearings on being a quality server here and how to handle most of your basic restaurant complications; long ticket times, getting sat multiple tables, complaints, etc. I was noted by management for receiving compliments almost daily from guests. I had a great management staff to learn under at this location, at a time when Chili's was booming. It could be frustrating at times, as a new server, but I quickly moved past that. It was a good place to start serving, and I worked with friends. It was close to home and my foot in the door to serving right after turning 21."
good,I love working here because it is a restaurant that gets a lot of customers for me to interact with. I love being able to make customers enjoy their visit so that they return again!
good,"I loved working for chilis, exspecially the one where i was employed, the staff and mangers are all like a family and take care of each other in and out side of the work place. I learned alot from my managers and was given the oppurtunity to help them on running the store on a need to manage basis you can say by working as a key employee which allowed my to utilize past mangement experiance that i had accquired from a previus employer. My co-workers were amazing and some became the best of friends that one could ever ask for. Some times the clientel could be a little extreme but we always managed to make it through the day laughing no matter what went wrong or happened."
good,"I enjoyed working for Chili's because it was an awesome place with amazing people. The management, the customers, and the fellow employees made each day fun and exciting. I woke up ready to go to work each day!"

good,"Chilis was the best place i ever worked. the management was great, it was very a fast paced workplace. it made time fly"
good,Chilis is awesome! The Employees are awesome and had an excellent time hanging out just not the job for me
good,"I was there for 5 and 1/2 years, loved it, however I had to relocate to Harrison, AR"
good,I have to say this was by far my favorite place to work. The customers were great and so were my co workers. The training was thorough and exciting. If I were to change anything it would have been the pay and lack of hours.
good,"The management was very good, they could work with the hours that I requested, most of the workers were respectful to each other and we always made sure the guests were happy."
good,Chili's has a fun environment that anyone will enjoy. They offer free food when training and discounts once you've worked with them for so long. The people go out of their way to help you.
good,I enjoyed being employed in a facility where individuals strive to provide genuine excellent service to individuals. Learning from mistakes making me wiser in customer service.
good,I love love working here it is always a new adventure with different customers and the people you work with rock deffenetly recommend working here if you’d like flexibility with hours
good,"I have worked for Chili’s since 2002. I started out as a server and moved my way up to bartender and manager fairly quickly. Great atmosphere and belief system. We take our jobs seriously, but not ourselves!"
good,No bad complaints whatsoever from me great job to work for and to get some beginning experience for the job site friendly people and always willing to find you more hours for working
good,"Exelente trabajo mucho aprendizaje y te hacen responsable sin saber ah ... "

good,I love the people and the environment just hard to live off the money you make there . The management isn’t always the best but I think that could be with any place.
good,I enjoyed my time with the company. I was with them for almost ten years. I was well compensated for my efforts. I would recommend this location to anyone looking to move up in a fair environment.
good,"I’ve worked at Chili’s for a little over a year and a half. Like any job, there are good and bad days. But the work environment is definitely one of a kind. Managers are amazing and willing to work with your schedule. We have St. Jude month, which is an entire month dedicated to raising money for the children’s hospital. We also have contests: when you sell promo items and the top team members get fun prizes. The relationships I’ve formed with the coworkers are life-long. Most importantly, there is team work like you’ve never seen before. If you need help you get it. The job has honestly been one of the most rewarding things in my life so far, and forming a good connection with the guests is also rewarding, as it makes your job easier. Especially getting new regulars simply because they love your work ethic. If you get the opportunity, give Chili’s a chance!"
good,"Chili's is an incredible company to work for.  They care about their employees and it shows in the incentives they give you.  The parent company, Brinker International, provides all the tools needed for a successful business operation."
good,"Started off as a host.moved up quickly transferred to three different locations while my years with chilis loving every single one management was always great, staff always unique money always consistent."
good,I love my Chili's family !  Great company to work for. Management really cares! I love my regulars and just enjoy working here. It is high paced and can be stressful however we all work as a team and help one another out! Best company I've worked for :)
good,"I used to work at chilis mililani as a dishwasher, got paid fair and treated well. Don't have your feelings down when they yell at you or something cause during work everybody's stressed out but afterwards no. The management was solid and in order to move up you have to prove to them that you are willing to go beyond. In all honesty my parents made me quit because I wasnt working full time, saddened by the fact that my parents wanted me to quit, but since I'm about 4'12"" it was difficult for me because everything taller than me except a couple of things but in all honesty it's really hard to find a job as good as this."
good,Chili's is fun very team player friendly like the management i would tell anyone to apply there. Tips are fair hours are fair. If u want to learn hiw to serve this is a great place to start. VERY COOL TEAM OF PEOPLE

good,"I worked for Chili's for two years and I had learned to love the work, the company, the people and the management. Challenging yet very well compensated. They give importance to their people's development and their training is excellent. A very fun work culture. If I hadn't relocated up north, I would have still be working for and with them. Thank you Chili's."
good,"Working at chili’s was a great experience compared to the other restaurant related jobs I have had before."
good,I just to say Chili's Philippines can helped to the staff and delivering fresh food and friendly to making people special every visiting our guest. Feel comfortable and food hot served time to time.
good,The chili’s on tower road is always busy. I only work nights but I am happy with what I make. It’s just like any other restaurant as far as people calling in. You gotta make the best of those kinds of situations. As far as managers the ones on tower road have always seemed to care about their employees. I would strongly recommend this job for servers who can keep up and want to make money.
good,"A great place to advance into resteraunt Management. Easy to use, well organized system for the kitchen. A great rewards program as far as hard work recognition. All around great place to work."
good,"My experience working at Chilis was a great one. As soon as i started, the staff invited me in with open arms. I loved the way everyone was willing to help me with whatever I needed. Management was great and on site the majority of the time, they were super involved with their employees as well as really understanding. My year there was amazing and I'm glad I got the experience."
good,"Working at chili’s will always be known as the best time of my life, the management was strict but relaxed at the same time always making sure work came first and then a fun time. The staff was incredible and full of character as was the management."
good,"I enjoy it here. Just wish I got 40 hours a week. Installed there with 40 but now I might be lucky to get 30. The manager will ask if I'm finished and when I say not yet, they say they will finish instead of letting me finish"
good,"I enjoyed being apart of chili’s environment. It’s Healthy and Everyone works together, I Would recommend this job to anyone looking for a job in this field."

good,"4-close or 10-5"

good,You meet you meet new people and they don’t make you do stuff quickly all the people their are very nice and they are good helpers and it was a great experience working their
good,"Hardest part was the fact I lived in Millington and I was promoted to Jackson Tn restaurant that was a 120 mile round trip. So drives home would be extremely hard after a long busy day. "
good,"Working at Chili's as a QA (Quality Assurance) the servers depend on me to make sure their customer(s) food gets to the table with its correct modifications. I also work as a Hostess and To-Go. During those shifts I have the responsibilities of making sure the customer(s) needs and expectations are met. While working at Chili's for about 2 years I have learned that customers needs are very important as well as having a great environment not only for the staff but for the customers. Our management team could work on communication but on the other hand, management is great. The hardest part of QA would be maintaining the speed of getting food out correctly modified as well as hot and fast. The most enjoyable part about working at Chili's would be the incredible staff members."
good,"We have a lot of fun at chili’s.  We have a lot of regulars that come in and take care of us. It’s pretty consistent, when it’s busy, it’s busy and really slow during back to school months."
good,I am on my feet roughly 8-10 hours but the pace is enjoyable and makes time go by quickly. You meet all kinds of people and co workers. management is usually fair and understanding.
good,Es buen empleo buen ambiente ay crecimiento de acuerdo a tu esfuerzo y dedicación

good,"la mejor experiencia que he tenido hasta ahora ."
good,Great people and great environment. I would like to be giving a chance to work at chillis again. It could be stressful at time but once we get a good team work goin on everything is good.
good,"Servicio al cliente, en equipo restaurante en crecimiento"
good,"Horarios flexibles para estudiantes así como motivación para seguir estudiando y trabajando. Aprendí a tratar con clientes así como el orden de toma de pedidos de los mismos, realizar corte y monitoreo de plalatillos. Los gerentes son muy amables y tratan de hacer que te sientas comoda para trabajar buscando solucionar y enseñar acciones. Un ambiente de trabajo muy sano y divertido! mucha comunicación"
good,Working with Chilis was fun to care for several type of people and make money. I was able to provide  fast and excellent service for hungry customers and get paid based on my performance.
good,"Hay facilidad en cuestión de horarios y mas si eres estudiante, buenas propinas, que es lo mas fuerte de hay, oportunidad de crecimiento y salir del estado a inaugurar nuevas tiendas, mucho trabajo en equipo y muy buena capacitación"
good,Chilis is a wonderful place to work. They work with your availability as much as possible to guarantee the most work hours possible for their team members. Chilis also takes pride in caring for the well being of their team members. They raise money for St.Judes and gets the team members involved in outside activities like co ed softball tournaments. I absolutely enjoy working for this company.

good,Chilis was my first job. I worked in the back as a prep cook. My very first day was LONG AND HARD. It is very fast paced and you have to be ready to work when you get there but it is completely worth it. some places the managers don't do jack but at the chilis in Dalton the get down and dirty with you. They help you with anything that 
good,"Chilis was one of the best jobs I ever had. When you worked hard they recognized you and made sure you were rewarded for your work. It was clean, fun and the coworkers were the best part of coming to work each day. As a host I had to seat customers and clean, but even when it was busy and overbearing someone was always there to help."
good,"Chili's took very good care of their employees.  The only drawback is the hours.  You could close the restaurant one night and open the following morning.  Plus, the schedule was never the same."
good,"Chili's is a great place to work! advancement opportunities are available for any and all positions! the corporation is great and working is fun and exciting. it does get busy and can be very stressful at sometimes, comes with the territory"
good,Very structured and well ran company. They have specific guidelines on coaching and praising employees and are very concerned about personal well being
good,"- Chilis YYC rolls like a good oil machine. Due to Airport location its always about sales and traffic."
good,You feel like family< birthdays and own life celebrations are recognized. I learned a lot from the the dedication the managers have and the fairness they treat everyone

good,Very good group of people and management that worked there.  Management was engaging and seemed to truly care about the employees and the culture they were developing.
good,"A lot of running food drinks customer service. training and menu rollover every 6 months, Management always do their best to ensure guest happiness. Guest first.( culture) The hardest part of the job was the deep cleaning night. When my regular customer come to see you."
good,Chili's is a great place to work and a great chain to be involved in. My time at Chili's was been a wonderful and positive experience by learning new ways to improve yourself in the work place.
good,Being restaurant it is fast paced and taught me a lot about dealing with people. Overall the chilis i worked for was the best. I made great money and gave me an amazing opportunity to develop my skills in customer service. Hardest part was dealing with other servers who didn't care to be there.
good,I have been working in chilis from last two years the experience of working here is awesum.the environment is very friendly and energetic.the management team is very cooperative and helpful.the team was very supportive .
good,"Everyone that I worked with was wonderful and management was great. Although it was a little hard to learn all the time, they changed their menu quite often so there was always something new."
good,"Typical day involved taking care of guests, taking down orders, entering orders in the P.O.S. systems, running food, stocking up service stations, ect. Management was a great well oiled team, always there to assist with basic duties and looking out for the restaurants best interest. Hardest part of the job was rush hour when the restaurant would be packed. Enjoyed taking care of guests, other employees made going to work much more less stressful."
good,Super great place to work. Great management; great employees. Everyone that eats there is also nice. Great customer discount on a great menu. Very nice.
good,Over all its a real family environment. Everybody looks out for one another. Of coures we have a few things we need to work but it was the 1st job after my divorce and it has heloed me soooo much.
good,"Obviamente no todas las franquicias de chili's son iguales, pero en la que yo laboro el sueldo es igual que al de todos los que trabajan en esa empresa, sin embargo los puntos (propinas) están muy bien pagados, si haces todo a tiempo, respetan completamente tu horario, el ambiente es muy agradable por los compañeros de trabajo, supervisores y gerentes, es una lugar limpio, y se preocupan por problemas personales."
good,"Chili's was a fun place to work. Great management,  upbeat and pleasant coworkers,  relaxed atmosphere are what really made it an enjoyable place to work. The menu was always changing."
good,"Very fast past environment, long hours on your feet don't make as much money but on good night it's worth it you can make ok money during the weekend if you put in work."
good,"Trabajar en chilis ha sido una muy buena experiencia, no tengo quejas pero ya hace falta un cambio"
good,"Fun to work if you work with people who know how to do their job well. Working with some people that just aren't ""good"" for this job will drive you insane when you have to work twice as hard to do your work and theirs. You wage is tips from tables so it's always hit or miss. Some tables tip decently while others tip less than 10%."
good,Pretty chill place to work. Flexible hours with a fun and relaxed culture. I was a server for Chili's for 4 years and enjoyed it. There's usually a high turnover rate for servers and heart of house staff here. Management has always been reasonable and respectful.
good,Best coworkers i could have ever asked for. Management was great when i needed days off for family events. Work hard and you'll easily be promoted. hh
good,"Chilis restaurant is a high demanding environment. Well rounded and is all about team work as well as individual daily duties. Throughout my years at chili's I am able to do manager duties like hiring, inventory, handle any problems that our guest might have and resolve issues, filling in when workers are absent and running the restaurant as if it were my own. Helping severs and cooks out when it is needed. Being their taught me manager skills and how to be well rounded as a person."
good,Liked what company stood for great ethics and integrity. Like the st. Jude childrens hospital drive every year. Great food quality and skills that will carry to any job
good,I loved working for a cooperate restaurant. All the foods were portioned and it was a very organized place to work. The management was great they always loved to help and let us know what we needed to do different.
good,"I'm a firm believer that in any position or organization, team work is what makes a business strive and flourish. Setting daily goals and completed them builds such a confidence in an individual. What I appreciate the most about Chili's, is the way management take under consideration the great work their employees accomplish. Rewarding team members as well as always encouraging. In an environment where every one knows how to get along and most importantly know how to work together makes work so much more enjoyable. It also makes you only want to work harder and better. The most enjoyable part of work would probably be the end of the shift knowing I had a great shift with a great team, knowing that coming back the next shift is going to be enjoyable with plenty to look forward to."
good,Best company that I have been for me. We treat everyone as a family. We have good working environment. We always learn new things. We have a good culture.
good,"Typical day at work is making sure food comes out on a timely and presentable manner."
good,everyone at chilis is very respectful and very helpful and helping you learn new things. it is also very fun to work for tey have a great team and very fun to work with.
good,This place is amazing. Although I don't run into bad work environments this is by far my favorite job! 100%would recommend to everyone
good,Starting with the right attitude from the beginning is key to learning new menu entrees. Pleasant atmosphere to work in. Fast pace work environment with lots of opportunity to increase your income.
good,"Here is where I always gave great customer service and I found in myself what a great salesperson/promoter I was. This company was always fast paced and always reaching company goals. I'm very fortunate to have worked here. In service industry there is usually drama between associates, but I was there to work and make money. I enjoyed working with my co-workers. I didn't get involved with drama. The managers there were always having fun and making it fun for us by having competitions to earn more money, trips to Six Flags, and household items. The hardest part of the job was if associates called out. it put more pressure in the kitchen and us servers/bartenders. Chili's was a great atmosphere to work in. We all would work together as a team and that made it fun always to come to work."
good,All of my coworkers were amazing.  They were supportive and understanding. The work space was competitive and productive so time flies by.  The night shift is where I belong on any roster.
good,Great staff when the kitchen is fully staffed. I enjoyed working there. Management was always helpful. there wasn't enough communication between the kitchen and front of house but it was the only issue I had.
good,"Working within the margin of food service hospitality is something every human being should be required to experience. It tests your peer to peer skill set. To recognize this job helped me shed my introvert personality to become somewhat of a social butterfly. Keeping the humble nature of oneself is the most impressing feature. I was offset due to the flow of finances changing but I am proud to say that I am, for the better, a different person because of my time there with amazing coworkers and friends. Dare I say family?"
good,"-sort menus"
good,Chilli's was fun to work for. the customers you get everyday are the best part. making a relationship with your customers was enjoyable and I will never forget that.
good,"It was a great job fu and meeting new people from all over the world, definitely will do it again. Great management and fun to work with it"
good,Fast pace work environment.  I worked under an experienced management team.  This job provided life long educational experiences while simultaneously helping me to grow as an individual.  I recommend Chilis as a great place to work.
good,great atmosphere. good team work. great mangers for the most part. awesome benefits. our management is pretty laid back and very understanding. best food industry to work for!
good,"love this company .very laid back and fun to work for. I am not micro managed in any way, as long as I am handling my business that's all they care about."
good,The people are amazing and always supportive of you. If you find yourself struggling you will also find help right around the corner to help guide you to becoming better at your job.
good,It was a good job. the people there was very friendly. If you needed help they would help you. I would have loved to stay but I had to move.
good,"Awesome job, fast pace, good money, flexible schedule.The environment its really good and at the same time stressful, able to make from $70 to $200 in one night."
good,"Within the restaurant, I am able to host or serve and still get to maintain friendly relationships with coworkers and guests."

good,"Enjoy the flexibility of scheduling, being one-on-one with customers and the hard work."
good,It was a great place to work it was more like a family than a place of employment i was sad to leave it
good,"I would get to work and prepare for my shift.  I would attend to customers, and use the computers to enter the customers orders.  I would have to do stocking, and cleaning up after my shift."
good,"Chilli's is a great place to work. Friendly people, and managers are great and flexible. They also show you how everything must be done, and show appreciation when you do so. Great environment, and I think the best part are the people who work there, and also being able to talk to others and being able to see people leave the restaurant with a smile on their face satisfied with their meals. "
good,"Chilis was actually one of the best companies I have worked for."
good,Great co-workers and costutmers. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing all the familiar faces everyday.
good,"Chili's has been a great job to have while I'm am in college. The managers there are very motivated and encouraging. The job itself builds your people and communication skills. My co-workers were all very friendly and showed great team service. The hardest part of my job would be working in a fast paced, stressfull environment, which is not for everyone, but it works for me. The most enjoyable part of my jobs would be making memories for people and helping them have a memorable experience. "
good,"I worked here for a few months shy of five years, and I worked very hard. With the right management it ran smoothly. Some weak links that were given too many chances that compromised the business, but overall it was a great run! Loved working there."
good,"I enjoy going to my job on a daily basis. The managers really care and make sure that the employees are taking care of. As far as schedule, safe environment, friendly atmosphere etc."
good,"A typical day was 4pm-12am. I learned plenty; between the customers, employees, and teaching new employees, there was always a lesson learned. Serving is hard, fast, constant work. The hardest part of the job would be getting others to care as much as you do about your job. There is always work to do in a restaurant; something will always need cleaning. So when there is downtime, go and clean something to make use of your time verses just standing around fiddling on your cell phone. The most enjoyable part is meeting many new people while waiting on them. You build a relationship with not only your fellow employees but your customers."
good,"Most days were very busy than others, especially on the weekends. I learned how to work at a steady speed and to be able to talk at the same time. The management was awesome. My co-workers were great, they always kept a smile on my face. For me, there was no hard parts to my job. But, if I would choose one I would say the day after bug night. The most enjoyable day was Valentine's Day because one of the managers specially made an individual cake for every female that worked there."
good,I enjoyed the time I spent at Chili's. My managers and coworkers were all compassionate about the work they performed. I learned much about cooking and about being a leader.
good,"I love chilis the people/ customers are awesome. there are an occasional tables that will not be pleasent but thats all part of waitressing. my co workers are the best, just simply awesome. Chilis is very family oriented."
good,"Cash Handling, smiling faces from the management and co-workers!"
good,Very good place for college students who needs to keep money in there pocket
good,"I greet the customers with a warming smile, provide great customer service, perpare their food and serve them to whatever they need. I also handled the Togo area where I had to answer the phones, handle the computer, take care of customers that walked in and prepare the food at the same time."
good,Love the staff and was able to show all my people skills to the max everyday.
good,"Most often the shifts were pretty easy, great co-workers, great management that I am confident will really help the business become better as time goes on, and great money even during lunch shifts. It was not hard to find a balance between enjoying your day with the people you work with and still taking care of your tables. There are days sometimes where it can get pretty hectic (a lot of the time, it's due to a backed up kitchen), but when it's all said and done, it's usually well worth it. I became very proficient with the Aloha system, learned a lot of restaurant lingo that I hadn't known prior to working there and generally learned a lot more about how restaurants are run."
good,"A typical day at work, would be coming in to work and setting up my 6 tables. I learned that sometimes people are just not going to be happy no matter what you do. Management was very positive."
good,"Chili's had a great blend of people... customers, employees, and managers. I was able to meet a lot of people from all walks of life. We had great team work and enjoyed being at work."
good,"A typical day at work required high stamina, a good and positive interaction with colleagues and clients within the food industry ""Chili's"". I was a line cook and prep cook. I learned valuable skills which included various food preparation."
good,"I absolutely love the positive environment that this workplace provides. You will never have to worry about being treated unfairly here. Employees are quick to help, and love to provide answers to any questions you may have."
good,"Lugar que forma Profesionales, Divertido, estructurado, ordenado, Cultura de trabajo, trabajo en equipo."

good,This job was great. It being located in such a small town you started to see regulars as well as got to meet so many new faces. Management was fair and they always helped to keep the staff on track.
good,Pleasant environment to work in everybody is so friendly and treats everybody with respect.Its a fun place to work for I also can do any job.A typical day at work would be doing what I’m supposed to be doing.
good,nice place to work paid well managemen was cool great hours clean environment gave me days off that was needed got plenty of overtime got paid every 2 weeks
good,I enjoy working for Chili's. The managers have worked with my time availability as it has changed over my employment. They have been nothing but considerate when a family member passed away as well. I have gained some good friends working here and I plan to stay for a long time.
good,I worked here for about 9 months. A great atmosphere and helpful management team. My hours were flexible and they provided us with an application that made shift exchanges easy. It is a fun place to work at!

good,"being a server has been something i have done off and on since i was 18. customer service is something needed to learn in daily life every day, and also very hard work. best money earned and have ever made."

You can have as many hours a week as you would like. They try to balance your home/work life as well so that you don't burn out. They also use team service. 2-3 people in a larger section, working together as a team to accommodate every guest with the best care allows for skill advancement as well as better opportunity to make more money."
good,I like active work and learning new things. There were a lot of great people working there and opportunity for growth. The shifts were not too long unless you wanted to work doubles. I enjoyed the discounts and benefits as an employee
good,Hosting. Taking great pride in making sure customer needs were met. Money and handling. Greeting folks coming in and ensuring that customers were happy.

good,"I would always be greeted when I came in through the doors since most of the staff liked me and I liked them. We would clock in and make sure the restaurant was ready to go, tables were made sure they were clean and stocked. Once people came in you and your partner, who go in rotation of tables, take care of the guests and make sure their visit in enjoyable. You make small talk, make them laugh, get them to come back and request your section and you specifically which made them regulars.After a long shift you would clean your section, stock everything up, and close down for the night. As I was a closer most nights, I would be there till we closed the restaurant."
good,"Excelente lugar para trabajar, gran ambiente laboral, compañeros dispuestos a ayudarte en lo necesario."
good,"Typically we had our own sections at Chili's. That would be considered all of our tables we needed to take care of. Taking food orders, drink orders and payment of checks. The hardest part of the job was when the rush would come in and food orders would be a mistake at time."

good,"Excelente clima laboral, el mejor trabajo que tuve en mi vida."
good,"Originally I was hired as a server, but for some reason I started hosting. I was supposed to be working full time but I guess as a host you only work about two hours a day. It was really unfortunate because I literally could not pay any of my bills off of that. I still work there. Only on the weekends. It makes a really good second job. You could always work two hours in the afternoon and your other job or two hours at night and your other job right before that."

good,"At chili’s, I grew as a person and advanced really fast. The managers always gave me an opportunity to become better, I , of course took that opportunity and made them proud to have gave me that trust."
good,I really enjoy working for Chilis but would like a chance to advance and have benefits. I enjoy my co workers and meeting new people. I also love the fact that every day is different and it is very fast paced.
good,Extremely good company to work for that offers a variety of opportunities to advance and is heavily involved in helping the community.  Team service evolution has expedited food and drinks to the guests and allowed servers to communicate more effectively the hospitality portion of the industry that increases profits for all.
good,Working at this Chili's has been a refreshing change from other restaurants I have worked in.  The team is very helpful to one another and everyone flows together well.  The management staff is very knowledgeable and helpful.

good,"Por lo que eh indagado ,  mi evaluación es recomendable"
good,"I really enjoyed working at Chili's. GREAT staff and management! A typical day if opening would include rolling silverware, cleaning doors and windows, and just making sure the restaurant is overall prepared and presentable for the day. Then you seat guests and bus tables for the rest of your shift. A closer just comes in and seats people and busses tables and performs ""outs"" before leaving such as checking bathrooms, cleaning outside garbage, etc. Although I enjoyed my time here, I just realized that customer service is not me forte."
good,In order to work at chili’s you must be able to work with and as a team. You are required to assist one another. Be a dependable employee and be prepared for any task given to you.

good,"Usually i am apart of the management teams so we usually discuss the number and associate that with what need to be distributed that day with a follow up to the staff. Staff always love me so easy delivery. Hardest part of the job was the hours put in past the 50 hours i was originally asked to work. On the other hand i loved the job, the people, and the employee especially when i was able to give incentives for great job done."

good,"Domingos"
good,The management team was amazing!  They were very supportive with scheduling needs and were very patient while I was in training.

good,I enjoyed working at Chili's I was young and just trying to provide for my small household at the time but enjoyed the fun and up pace environment very quick and no time to Slack
good,"Being at Chili's is great. A typical day at work is great because everyone works together to make it a good work environment. The management is what really makes it better, they're helpful and courteous. They treat everyone alike which makes people feel better about working there and I believe that is why our turnover rate is so low. I believe the hardest part of the job is when the cooks and servers have a communication error. Because once that fails food takes much longer to come out and therefore guests may get upset which in turn doesn't make the restaurant efficient. The most enjoyable part of the job is the guests and the people I work with. The people I work with make my job easier because we work together as a team."
good,"From top to bottom everyone is family. That is important!!!!!!!!!!!"
good,It was always a very fun place to work at and was sometimes stressful but it is a restaurant. Its a great company to work for. The staff and managers are great people.

good,Working at chili's as a server was hard work but I had fun serving each and everyone that came there to eat. The general manager is easy going and a lot of fun but still takes his job serious and makes sure everyone else plays their part.
good,"Chili's was phenomenal place to work. the environment was pure, lively, and different every day. when you work at chili's you never really know what your day is going to look like but you know it will be interesting and a fun filled day"
good,Chilis is an amazing place to work with great managers and team willing to grow. The team members are awesome and it is very fast paced but everyone should have a waitressing experience like the one you get here.
good,"The food is amazing, service is wonderful, and the desserts are delightful. Bout once have i left an unhappy customer. Management is always assertive, and the workers work."

good,I worked every station. As well as trained cooks and managers how to work every station. They had great benifit's . I left there seeking better oppurtunites.
good,"A typical work day consisted of me greeting guest as they arrived, then taking them to which ever table is next in the assigned rotation, placing their menus in front of them and letting them know their server would be right over. Then when guest would leave I would have to go over and help bus the tables for the servers and Nights I closed I would help clean their sections if they simply asked however it was not a required task. I cleaned the bathrooms, stocked up all kids menus and silverware and organized menus"

good,Chili's was an excellent opportunity for me to learn about the restaurant industry and improve my skills in both FOH and BOH. As a server the managers have your back and genuinely want you to be as prepared as possible to make every shift a good shift. Best restaurant culture I've experienced so far.
good,Working at Chili's was a great first job. I would like to think that I took full advantage of everything it had to offer as far as reaching my occupational potential at such a young age. I started when I was 16 starting off as s hostess. When I was 18 years old I was legally eligible to start my next challenge as a waitress. I loved being able to make sure my guests had the best dining experience I could give them. It also gave me the opportunity to meet and build relationships with business women and gentlemen to give me other opportunities in the work place. When I had about a year of server experience I excelled in Bartending. I was about 19 years old to have that opportunity came with great responsibility. While working as a bartender one of my managers asked if I would be interested in being a Shift Leader. At that time we had a high turn rate with our managers and with my years of employment I was a stable leader/trainer. I enjoyed being able to work on different areas of the restaurant while also having the advantage of insuring an excellent customer experience to every single individual in the restaurant.
good,"this was the best place i have worked some good memories "

The environment was very relaxed for patrons and the service was very diverse. Although like other jobs at times it could be frenzied and chaotic for employees but most times very laid-back. The company was popular and executed proficient customer service. I do believe The managers sometimes could have been more attentive to their employees and appreciative.The hardest part of the job was adapting to the disorganization or segregation of the managers. The most enjoyable part was assuring great customer service, all while meeting different types of people and making new relationships with employees(and customers) through team work!"
good,"Darden companies gave me an opportunity that in my opinion is without value.   The training was extensive and lengthy; but paid.  It's been some years but I'm sure their success is due to consistency; did I'm gonna say they promote family and friends,  employee recognition,  opportunity for change.   Flexible shifts. pick-ups  available daily. In my experience with Olive Garden and Red Lobster, it was my pleasure working there."

You get to work with awesome people of all different ages, and the managers really strive to make sure they are treating everyone equal and fair. In my time at Chili's, I made great money and got to meet really nice people every shift. My home restaurant was in the middle of a convenient shopping center, so we had a lot of regulars which was awesome because you just become so close to them, it becomes weird to you if they don't show up. The people I worked with were awesome and are now life-long friends of mine, no doubt about it. The hardest part of the job was definitely when we were super busy and all sections and servers were full. It's hard regardless of what position you're working, because the #1 goal is to ensure the guests are happy. The most enjoyable part of the job is definitely all the people you meet and all the relationships you get to create."

good,"Primarily, I was a dishwasher. It was fast paced and that was all I did. I sprayed, scrubbed and organized dished to run through a large machine. A lot of times, I would have to rewash them again and clean the machine a lot. I was mainly a night shift employee, so I would wash the cook's and server's dishes and utensils. I was in my own section and didn't have a lot of communication. Just piles of dishes. Whenever I would work mornings, I would be called up to help prep veggies and work with the cooks when it was needed. The job wasn't difficult. Just wet all the time. The end of the night was the most enjoyable when I cleaned up my station."

good,"I loved everything about this job. I had so much fun and learned so much not only about the company but about myself. I chose to leave on my own for personal reasons but left on great terms. This is a fun, fast paced environment but when you are the leader, you get to set the tone for your shift and setting a positive vibe for everyone everyday was what worked for me.

The company works from the inside out, forging worthwhile and mutually beneficial relationships with its team members and vendors to create a comfort that extends out to the guest in a very real and palpable manner. Genius."

good,"Awesome work team, felt like a second family. Usually would come in and relieve previous person in the specific position we trained for. I learned leadership skills, how to manage duties in a fast/slow paced environment, most enjoyable part of the day was just coming in and meeting new people, making new friends with the amount of people that would come into the restaurant."
good,I absolutley enjoyed working for Chili's for the year that I did. It was such a fun-loving environment and I learned a lot from these people.. I would definitley work there again in resturant 611 or any other resturant that would allow me on their team.
good,"I love a fast paced enviroment, i like to learn any new menus and teach others to make the line successful.  I get along with everyone and love my job as a cook.

good,"I love my work team the managers are very kind and understandable, the mates have become my second family. A normal day of work can not be called normal, since it is full of surprises you never know with which you are going to have to deal with the guests, which taught me to be a patient and dedicated person. I learned that you have to love what you do and dedicate it to everything you do at work because if you do not do it that way you will not have the future that you want. The most difficult part of my job is to see how sometimes people want to trample you and say that you do not do your job the right way, because of this I do my best to do an excellent job and not receive any kind of complaints."

good,"Excelente empresa, trato de primera tanto a gerente y colaboradores"
good,"Typical day of work was clocking in, washing hands, and jumping right into work. Work entailed cleaning dishes, cleaning the dish machine repetitively, taking out trash, sweeping, and cleaning mats. Management was very professional and helpful.They would train you for about week with someone who is knowledgeable of the station. Co-workers were funny and lively to be around. The hardest part of the job was time management because as dishwasher you are the last to leave and you don't want to leave at 1am when the kitchen closed at 11pm. The most enjoyable part of the job would be my co-workers."
good,Everything was great at both jobs. I also learned how to be more confident in myself that I can work under pressure in a fast paced environment and get the job done. I love people so I don't tend to let things interfere with my work ethic. The most enjoyable part of my job  is I have a passion for helping and communicating with people as a whole.
good,Great company! Very rewarding and fun environment! Always improving and staying one step above other competitors! Health benefits as well as 401k.....
good,As a host I had to create a balance between customer service and business efficiency. I learned to prioritize stressful situations while still maintaining a welcoming presence of the company. Shortly after demonstrating faithfulness and dedication I took the next step to grow within the company and was offered a position as waitress. I underwent training and eventually became a certified corporate trainer. Chili’s taught me to have commitment and truly devote myself in a work environment I find rewarding
good,"Chili's has been a great work place for me over the past few years. I love the positive energy that my managers and teammates bring me while I'm at work no matter what kind of day we're having.

Management was very visible and hands on.  Co-workers were fun and helpful.  The hardest part of the job was giving good service at lunch and dinner hours.  The most enjoyable part of the job would be going to work.  I loved working there."

good,"Chili's is an incredible place to work for. The management is amazing and flexible when it comes to scheduling. The management gives awesome training and does not ask you to do anything that they would not do themselves and they are incredibly helpful in anything that they see needs to be done. As all coworkers can be, people bump heads occasionally, but they handle it like adults and the ones that don't are handles in the appropriate manner right away. Chili's is a long-term company, they want people to stay with them long term, but they also understand that life changes happen and wish you well if you choose to leave and most likely are willing to have you return (as long as you were effective with your job). They work around you and what you need and understand that things happen, but they also don't allow themselves to be taken advantage of, which is great to see."

good,Everyone is really nice and respectful. The managers are very understanding and responsible. The hardest part of my job is keep 100% of the guests happy. There are some people who are never happy no matter what you do for them. The most enjoyable part about going to work is getting to spend time with friends while making money at the same time.

Their experience was important to me and as a hostess I would make sure I was the first and last great impression they got at Chili's. As their server I would take their order and make sure it was correct from the moment that I put it in the computer to the moment it got to the table.

Gerencia pro-activa en apoyo a todas las áreas, compañeros con un nivel acorde para realizar sus actividades y desempeñando una sana competencia con el equipo, la parte difícil era obtener mejores cualitativos a comparación de las demás sucursales de la cadena de restaurantes, lo que más me gusto fue el conocí a muchas personas, comprometidas y profesionales que me brindaron apoyo para mi desarrollo en la empresa."

good,They're flexible with your schedule which benefits college kids like myself. Only I wished was different was the pay rate. If you don't get good tips you don't make money. If servers had a decent hourly wage to fall back on then everyone would be happy.

good,"My typical day at work is obviously serving people. The difference between my day and anyone else's day (in a start up sort of job) is that it is filled with twists and turns. One moment you are sharing in a couple's anniversary dinner while the next you have a stressed out mom with 7 kids. I really have learned to deal with whatever comes my way with grace and with a humble attitude- aka, the customers are always right...even when you know they ordered what they got."
good,I was taught how to use a dishwasher and how to prep some side meals and how to cook certain dishes as well. They also have a great management team.

good,My days in my work is always challenge for me mostly for the busy time because by that i enhance more my knowledge and ability to do multi tasking.I learned in my work is to give my helpful hands to everyone or we called team work.management and co workers was doing great job because we have open communication.Theres no hardest part because this is our work everything will be easy if you know everything and everyones enjoying their work .the most enjoyable part was even in a busy time still we still make a joke to everyone to lose the pressure in our work.My work is one ofthe importance things in my life .
good,"served guests with a smile. Opened restaurant. Did opening duties (prepping for the day/ counting cash drawer). Worked for 8 hrs on my feet. I learned that the best way to deliver great customer service is to create bonds of friendship with your customer. Management was top notch, very supportive of there employees and always took care of the guest. Co-workers were friendly and trained well. Hardest part was busy times when doing over $150 in sales an hr. Most enjoyable part was creating friendships with guests and the relationships I built with them."
good,"It is in south America and it is very hot. you have to wear uniforms however, it's a very beautiful private school! The classrooms are small however there big enough for yourself and the student."

good,"Love the job, love the money, schedule, benefits, people. The only bad thing- no place for professional growth. Though its sometimes stressful, and very high speed, and you need to multitask, and physically work hard, its rewarding!

good,"Every day at work you enjoy the company of your co-workers as well as the guests and often are encouraged regularly to want to work more because the work environment is so friendly. Management always worked well with employees. If ever there was a problem, there was always a way to solve it without conflicting with other employees. Sometimes scheduling would become an issue when people would request off particular days leaving some people having to open and close back to back days which creates exhaustion for the employees."

good,"Working in a restaurant is definitely a tough job... you are viewed as literally a servant to some people. Which is very aggravating at times. It is also very stressful. You have to be able to move very quickly and remember orders and multitask like no other. I would have a full lounge, bar, and well... but I always worked better under pressure. I loved being busy and getting my butt kicked. It's just so much more rewarding when you actually work hard for something.  It is also rewarding... Or else so many of us wouldn't still be doing it. I had the pleasure of working with some pretty amazing people... We were (and still are) a family. We might of wanted to kill each other at times, but at the end of the day we always had each others back. Which is a pretty rare thing at some jobs. I also had the pleasure of Bartending for some amazing guests as well. For the most part, I got paid to hang out with people. Don't get me wrong, some guests are rude and disrespectful but that's just part of it. I managed a few times as well... I had some pretty great managers that I learned from. Being there for five years, we were more friends than anything. (which isn't always a good thing) They are some of the best people and it was a pleasure to work for such a caring, giving, and kind group of managers."

Management was always creating challenges to promote team moral. The company took time to recognize hard workers and gave to opportunity to climb the ladder."
good,My job is awesome. My co-workers and mangers are great to get along with. only hard part about my job is that we need to work together a little better to get things done faster and the right way when we get busy. but over rall their the best at chilis.

good,"Typical day at Chili's is taking care of customers. Cleaning menus, keeping the restaurant neat and orderly. Putting together the food for the To Go customers. Handling phone calls and reservations. I have learned a lot about how a restaurant works. Planning and managing events. People skills, learning to deal with difficult situations in a fast pace environment. Management has always provided help and knowledge when needed or asked. Coworkers all get along and help one another. The hardest part about my job is dealing with the customers impatience. The most enjoyable is the repeat customers that you form a bond and relationship with."
good,"A typical day at Chilis is saying hi to my coworkers, get updated  with life, get ready to work, and please customers with their needs always providing excellent customer service. I learned that a big smile goes a long way, and that team-work is essential to make a shift run smooth. Management is always making sure everyone is happy and helps out when we need them. My co-workers are friends that when we work together we always make sure we have a smooth and happy shift. The hardest part of the job is to solve problems thats does not solve as quick as we would like, but in the end we always make the customer leave happy and with a big wish to come back. I love my job, my co-workers, and to provide excellent customer service."
good,"Working at Chili's keeps me in a positive state.  It is a great environment where the management really cares about their guests and staff.  They work with us on scheduling, training, and ensuring that everyone is happy.  A typical day is coming into work, waiting on various tables throughout the night, cleaning up and going home.  I've learned a lot about myself and who I am as a person here.  I've met so many different people who have made an impact on my life already and that actually care.  The hardest part of this job is working with people who do not necessarily want to be there, the complainers.  The part I enjoy the most is serving my guests.  When my guests are so happy by the time they leave, that they will fill out surveys for me, demand to speak to my managers, and assure me that they will come back and ask for me fills me up with so much joy."
good,"you will have fun, and learn alot of things and management loves what they do and wants you to move up. but this is only in rancho cordova ca"
good,Typical server job. Very fast paced. Great food. Good tips.
good,"fun and exciting place to work as a waiter, I worked by the airport and met all kinds of people from all over the place, its fun and interesting, and intense. Some times customers are rude and you will get stiffed on a tip like all servers have at some point, but its not bad, i had managers that cared and would give you a tip from their own wallet. dinner and weekend rushes can ware you out, but its exciting."
good,"As a manager some of my duties was to ensure everyone was on task and doing a good job, ensure safety, ensure that the guest was satisfied, and ensure that I was able to problem solve.  At chili's I learned that it truly takes the whole team to succeed in having a driven, fun, and stress free working establishment.  Management  made sure to be on the same page and had the same expectations for the shift.  Co-workers worked together and hard to provide a pleasurable experience.  The hardest part of the job was when you experience a team member or management that has a poor attitude and no interest in doing their job.  The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing guest and team members having a good time.  Management can make or back a business.  If managers do their part things should run smoothly.  However, if managers just show up just to get a paycheck things can easily go bad fast."
good,"I had a lot of different jobs here. I was a Server, Busser, Host, Key shift, Dishwasher, Short order cook, and help management when needed. People that worked there were fun to be around same with the management. I learned a lot of different aspects of the industry. The hardest part was to make sure the guest were happy even though sometimes it was out of your hands, most enjoyable part was the people I worked with and the guests I met."
good,On a normal day at chilis I would come in and clock in. I would then clean up the line a little bit before I started getting food together. All through out the day I would be putting food on trays and making sure that they were correct and presentable. On some days we are super busy and I would have multiple tickets at a time and I could get them done in a efficient amount of time with more food being ready every minute. I would have to communicate to the cooks and the servers in a very professional manner. If I could not I would than call on a manager to handle the situation. The staff was always very nice and manager understanding.
good,"I feel that every person should work in a position in sales or as a server once in their life! Chili's was a fun place to work, the pay was great, good benefits, excellent management, and a wonderful training program."

good,two thumbs up! though the work is loaded you i never noticed the time passes by because of the harmonious and warm appearance of the management and the team member from back to front of the house. the most enjoyable part for me is when we gathered together despite of the differences in our off still we have time to get together and celebrate each and every staffs birthday.
good,Both restaurants have a wonderful set of managers and kitchen staff. Most shifts included immediate work from start to finish always doing a quality job.
good,"Happy co-workers  "

good,"Everyday at chilis is different, depending on the day or position I am each day. I love my co-workers and managers. The hardest part of my job is speed on a busy night. The most enjoyable would be talking and meeting new people and gaining regulars."

The person I work behind leaves notes of things that might need to be preped, Day dots are always correct so that I can know if anything on my line is expired, Temp.of meats is always checks and proper utinsils are in their places. After each shift all machinery is cleaned and sanitised correctly. Meat, veggies, and other perishable items are put in walk in cooler. My station is checked by supervisor on duty, and I clock out. Of coarse telling my co-workers to have a great night and drive home safely. Their is no hard part of this job.

good,"I think Chili's is such a fun place to work for. It's always enjoyable to take care of all the customers that come in. I come into work a positive attitude because that's what every guest should have! An average day would be making sure that every guest that comes in is happy and leaves satisfied. I have learned that not everyone that comes in is easy to please, but if you work hard and show that you care, you can make them leave happy. Working with all different types of co-workers has it's advantages and disadvantages. You get to work with really great people and than you get to learn how to deal with co-workers with different views as well. The hardest part of my job would be when it's slow. The most enjoyable is helping people enjoy a great meal and have them come back and see us again."

good,"A typical day at work consists of me being there anywhere from six to wight hours. I greet and seat guests as they come in and give them a nice farewell as the leave, hopefully persuading them to return. I clean and run food to tables when needed.

The hardest part about the job is when we go on a wait and we get slammed with guests, and the guests get upset because the timing is longer than usual."

I was also wrestling at the time, and learning to juggle my sports, work, and school at the same time proved to be very beneficial to my character and work ethic.
