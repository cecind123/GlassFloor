bad,"They don't care about team members at all. "
bad,Tyson foods in hope ark is messy and the supervisors sleep around with the workers even though their married they don't help you they tell all of your personal business to everyone
bad,They lied to me saying I get my own line and would be a lead when line came open they would not let me have it one supervisor was a rude  jerk thought he was better than everyone 14 years wasted with them
bad,This place is a revolving door.  Since there clients are all Tyson franchises the don't have to clean up after themselves.  they do not follow building standards or even there own drafting standards. no one has any experience & It won't be llong before you ar e out the dfoor if you insist on doing your work correctly.
bad,I didn't care for this job and the supervisors were rude and human resource people were even ruder you had be in their clique for them to hear you or even acknowledge you were an employee
bad,"don't expect to have a life Tyson wants you to work when they say to or else."
bad,Do not work here unless you are prepared to brown nose. There is a distinct click here and they only promote those in the click. They turn their heads at anything anyone in the click do.
bad,They should know that this company doesn't give bonuses for good work. And if you're not from Mississippi then you will not be allowed to move up. They jave favorites when it comes to following the rules and regulations of the company. Employees are not appreciated
bad,Terrible place to work they don’t care about your family or you or your safety or the environmentWhen I worked are you walk around and can use a needle was hoping that your job is secure but it’s not
bad,"Worst place I've ever work defiantly not professional, alot of supervisor on drugs & definitely don't demostrate profession for their position. It was a very messy (people) environment. People do not respect on another there . It's a job for those who cannot find suitable work anywhere else ."
bad,"awfully ghetto would not recommend, they snitch when its not their job nor are they getting paid to do so, all the women do is cause drama, and the men act like females... thank you"
bad,At the time the training was not so good.  The biggest reason was that they didn't have knowledge in the department I worked in.  I have heard they have turned a corner.
bad,This place is a joke at tdc Rogers Arkansas management sits in office all night on there phones and computers an flirty with the women they do nothing to help out their employees at all an the hr woman good god she thinks she is better than jesus himself
bad,"The job was very easy but so stressful bad Hr , dum Management , no job security I won’t recommend this facility to my worst enemy stay away from this plant"
bad,"They say safety first and they don't mean that. When you have health issues or car trouble they don't care. They will fire your butt . They want you their with what ever is going on in your live. With a dis regarding what ever you have going. Their is a roumr going on they will close their doors in five years. Since they are not bringing too much. This is all true."
bad,The managers will literally work you to death before letting you leave even if you are gravely ill. This company does not care for a humans well being.
bad,"A soul-crushing job, perpetually stimulated by the dead end lives of the employees. Money is good if you can stand long, hard hours with fellow employees who are less your friend and more a constant antagonist in your already hated existence."
bad,Everything is cheap and management is picky. Slips seat. Rental trucks. No detention or layover pay. Work like slave but reward nothing. Stinky environment!
bad,"They harass breastfeeding mothers! Hr is very rude, receive write ups for using the restroom or speaking to supervisors. Tons and tons of false allegations that could ruin your family and hr does nothing about it."
bad,"Very repetitive work for low pay.  You can make decent pay if you work a lot of overtime, but that is a lot of harm you are causing your body.  Required to work overtime,  no choice.  Alot of repetitive stress injuries, and it doesn't matter to them.  All they care about is making their daily goals.  Either extreme cold or hot temps.  Overall"
bad,"Overall waste of time. "
bad,Maintenance department is nothing but a bunch of clowns. Avoid 2nd shift for sure. Bunch of backstabbing nobody’s! 1st and 3rd ain’t much better. My advice to anybody that’s going to apply here is DONT!!! Keep looking!!!!!
bad,"The most unsafe workplace I have experienced.  An accident/fatality was not a matter of ""If"" but ""When"".  I reported unsafe work practices and situations and my concerns fell on deaf ears."
bad,"Horrible place to work. Management are all either related, sleeping together, or friends outside of work. There is very little chance for advancement if you don't fit in that category. They care little for life outside of work, and you get in trouble if you need time off. I worked there for several years, and was a good worker. But I got hurt on the job, and they looked for every opportunity to fire me instead of following protocol with Worker's Comp. Took them six months, but they did it. Now I'm crippled permanently and can't list them as a work reference. Avoid them if all possible."
bad,Tyson foods it's not worth working for they do not pay u on time but the ppl u work with are great an the benefits are not that great like they say it
bad,"Would not work here again. The place is poorly managed by drug addicts. The ones that are sober are just incompetent. It really makes you wonder how they got a job....... Then the plant harlot gets promoted to supervisor, then you quit cause you dont want to do all that to get ahead."
bad,I work with this company for 5 years. Anyone can make up a LIE on you and they would suspend you WITHOUT pay while they investigate. Do not work here.
bad,This was the most stressful job I have ever had. The people at the plant lvl were all great to work with. People at the cooperate lvl were non supportive and completely oblivious as to what and why things were bad and going wrong. Biggest problem was they attempted to run the plant several years 7 days a week with no time for maintenance and now about 80% of the equipment has known issues that they do not want to address.
bad,Very poor work environment overall hot and wet you rarely have the proper ppe or protective equipment they say they supply and you have to look and find any ladders pliers that involve doing and completing your job
bad,Tyson’s starts out good until you get used to things and find out how they really run the place and it pretty much goes down hill after u know what all is really going on
bad,If you don’t want a life then Tyson Foods is the job for you. If you are willing to be a working zombie then Tyson Foods is the job for you. Good luck.
bad,"This company has people in supervisory roles that know less about the equipment then the employees but insist on things being done their way.  If a problem arises if it isn't their solution then they don't use it.  Even though theirs may not even be related to the actual problem.  "
bad,Freezing and its not the company its the employees..like working with a bunch of high school drama..lots of yelling ..poor management and lots of favoritism. Nobody trains you they stick you in a spot and expect you to be fast and to be able to do everything off bat
bad,It's easy to get on. There's no union because management does whatever they want to do.    Nobody at Tyson is bias. Management lies and make up things as they go.
bad,Not a good place to work if you are black. It was one of the most stressful jobs i have worked. I was held back from promotions to better jobs within the company because of my skin color.
bad,I didn’t like this job it was cold non professional and the pay wasn’t that great and they didn’t offer no benefit the hours were horrible and long as well
bad,"People that work there are not clean and  do not handle the food  properly. They also leave stuff like plastics and other stuff like metal that is grinded up and goes into the meat."
bad,"My biggest pet peeves for Tyson's is the new point system and when we are required to work Saturday they let their employees know Friday. Thursday if you are lucky.  You can't spend your summer with your family or children. They work you ALL the time. If you are sanitation,You only get every other Sunday off. You are exhausted and don't want to do anything."
bad,"If you are not caucasian Tyson foods is not for you.  No forward thinking management personnel.  Emotionally driven decision making and most importantly the most hatefully racist place I’ve ever worked.  Employees aren’t even disciplined for making racially discriminatory comments even when admitting to it.  The problem is at the management level, specifically with Charlie  D."
bad,Not a good place to work really poor management no communication raises low pay for the job I don’t recommen to work in this place extremely estresfull no change to grow if you not a brown nouse
bad,Everything is a mess it's always stressful no time for breaks very unorganized. I didn't like management they made everything the workers fault. When its the machine ops fault.
bad,Was supposed to show me the ropes but didn’t teach me they put me 12 hours straight to work without knowing so that’s why I had to quit but I’m a very hard worker
bad,on a  typical work day the supervisors are constantly yelling and arguing with employees employee's are constantly throwing chicken and ice at each other
bad,I was not a good fit. People talked at you instead of to you. Not the place for me. 150 characters minimum is too much to explain why I left Tyson. Fin
bad,"Came to Tyson as a temp and had to threaten to quit to get hired in..then was offered 13.50 at hiring got my first check..making 12.45 told it had to be approved by Tyson but never heard anything  to this day. Supervisor talk to you however they want with no repucusions..over worked understaffed very very high turn over rate and I wouldn't eat nothing coming out of the caseyville Illinois location..listeria hits constantly and the even push production that was ran on molded machines out to our breakdown for us to eat"
bad,"It was very stressful at Tyson Foods, although the pay wasn't entirely bad.  I believe the worst part of the job was the lack of career advancement. Though they say that you can advance within the company I personally think that it is very hard to do so."
bad,"the first one to put yours problems out there are your own people all they do is talk about your all life but they don't say anything about there's...supervisor's are ""NO GOOD AT ALL"" {some of them}...people want to grow put in people under the Bus,,"",,,anyways not good at all to work there"
bad,"Worst place I have ever worked, period. They do not follow their own policy's or federal law if they assume they can get away with it. Do not waste your time with this company."
bad,Racis I work there almost 3 year and then liar fire me for no reason racis no home the right to talk poor manager supervisor then don't care about us poor ppl
bad,Don't work here if you want to advance and make a career. They will tell you how dumb and low you are because you chose to work here. Really makes you feel like you failed in life.
bad,"Over worked staff , under paid . HR refuses to disipline staff that breaks rules , due to religion , and race. The hourly staff is 98% African Refugees who are allowed to walk away any time. They are frequently allowed to walk away from production on false pretence of prayer. The prayer rooms are used to sit and talk , supervisors are not allowed inside prayer rooms to safely check on staff that has dissapreared. The team left in production while others walk away do double , triple work to make up for others just walking away."
bad,Most of the management lies as soon as their lips move . So unfair to most employees. The HR department is one of the worst side with supervisors most of the time even when proven wrong they don't do fair investigations. Waste a lot of money but cut your overtime to save money. And when you bring it up they don't want to hear it.
bad,They dont care about you at all. I almost died on my way to work on morning and the supervisor told me that was no excuse for being late. Most people would have even shown up after that.
bad,"Management is horrible at this plant. From the floor supervisors up to GPMs and Plant managers. There is absolutely no teamwork nor appreciation for employees. Employees aren't trained properly, but expected to perform the job perfectly and if not you'll get write-ups left and right. This Tyson plant has a very high turnover rate. There is a lot of favoritism. There is no point in going to HR with your problems or concerns because they just go back to your floor managers who are their friends and laugh/joke about any issues. If you're not friends with someone in a management position or sleeping with them you will constantly be taken advantage of. If you want to move up in the company it doesn't matter what education or how much experience you have if you aren't friends with someone in a higher position. This has to be the worse company I've EVER worked for. The job itself is easy, but it causes a lot of pain and medical conditions. They don't want you to go to the doctor or go home if you're in pain. They would rather you go to the nurse for two ibuprofens and back to work to cause more damage to yourself just so production is met. They don't want you to have a life outside of work. Women can't have their nails done. They don't give fair warning about working OT. They will literally tell you Friday before leaving work that you have to work on Saturday. They only give forty cent raises once a year based on production. If you don't check your hours and pay weekly they will definitely cheat you out of what you are owed. Thanksgiving day, Christmas Eve, Christmas day, and your"
bad,the people at tyson wear very rude and not very help full when someone got sick...  i wanted to move to a other departement and they told me at fiest that they would move me but it nevr happend.. so im decided to get another job
bad,"Not enough communication. No help from leads , too much favoritism and new hires are not trained properly. Late start ups . Breaks are optional only if you have enough time."
bad,It was a ok jobs for awhile but the management threated there employees bad there and some supervisors had gotten fired do to how they treat there employees. The pay isn’t great for the job duty’s they required when I was working at Mcdonalds I was making almost as much as Tyson that the reason I left Tyson because they treated me bad and I felt like I wasn’t welcome to the work area. I’m looking for a better opportunity to a more peacefully work place where everybody nice and not rude to there employees.
bad,management has no schooling some of the mechanics had more college than upper management.. Its like people club up the ladder if they know someone there.. Overtime only given out to supervisors favorites.
bad,"Maintain install troubleshoot electrical equipment.  Plc 5000 troubleshoot ladder logic moving and forcing on rungs.  Upgrade electrical sensors.  Routine PM,s on electrical contactors and motors.  Troubleshoot elect problems stemming from moisture."
bad,Not a Gud place to work the people do not care.longs hours run till u done with product and that’s 200 or 300.second shift.disrespectfull.team members and supervisor
bad,"Terrible place to work. You never know when  you will see your home because once you enter the building you will never leave, and you don't get to use the bathroom either."
bad,"Dont work here at Tyson tdc,they favored some races over others very stressful,no room for advancement management was cut throat an so were the supervisor"
bad,Packing and Shipping pork products! This environment was less than desirable though it was as to be expected. Very fast pace and physically demanding while working in cold temperatures for long hours at a time.
bad,"This place treat employees like slave. Almost absolutely  no different between first day or 15 years by pay. No respect!!!!!!!! Keep more work without pay list a penny"
bad,"They dont have your back stupid matto they go by they dont follow it though and too many white racist Burbank people there too, pay was alright but I stressed working there everyday, dont recommend this job to no one, anyone can do better then there"
bad,This company will train you but then the second you hit the floor everything you are trained for is thrown out the window only numbers matter and safety most definitely is not first at this place. Which is what they ram down your throat from the first step in the door. Also the most unsanitary workplace I have ever heard of.
bad,Very politcal managers didnt listen i got fired for telling them i had a emergency and had to leave the next day i was in hr they told me i crused my manager and suspened me for the day. I asked when can i come back they said they would call me. They never called back and only had 6 points where they offer 14. I worked for 1.5 years very disappointing
bad,Seventy plus hour work weeks.  No work life balance at all.  Management has no concern for employees life outside of work.  Incredibly hard to stay with this company
bad,"Had a horrible supervisor that didnt care one bit about whether i was sick, made me stay and work while having pneumonia, or lose my job...made it very hard to keep my job"
bad,This company does not care about the employee at all. This is why they have a union. Management was absolutely terrible and extremely rude. Highly stressful job.
bad,"My fiancé works here and stole my car, I went to retrieve and was confronted by a worker in a white mustang yelling racial remarks at me while my 2 young sons were in my car and heard everything. I called on site security (this took place at the 4000 Meacham Blvd Haltom City location) security sent out supv Larry from 3rd shift, I told him I was just trying to retrieve my car, I also told him about racial remarks being yelled at me by the one guy and the same guy (in white mustang, Akeem or something like that) took my battery out of my car and put it in his trunk. The supv said to show me the title and he will give me my car. I obviously don’t carry a title around with me so I went home after being humiliated and flipped off by my fiancé (while standing next to Larry the Supv) I grabbed my proof of ownership and called Larry and he said that he doesn’t want me on the property so I have to get it towed, I told him okay I will, then he said “no that won’t work, just stay away”. So, I have already told him I know about his shift employees using drugs while on the job and after work in the Tyson parking lot.. he didn’t care. I ended up calling Tarrant County Sherriffs Department And now have possession of my car. Today is a holiday, but I will be contacting corporate tomorrow to advise them of this incident and the poor choices made on Larry’s part and the “racist Akeem White mustang guy, I was also contacted later by a employee (security) and he said it’s all on video. 😉"
bad,"They work employees like slaves, treated us with nothing but disrespect, and will not let you leave even if your child or family memeber had to be rushed to the hospital. They also mad us process spoiled chicken wings."
bad,"fun workplace, nice people, great pay, good benefits, great hours, good breaks, cool managers, nice staff, good food, off on weekends, great environment to work in"
bad,Extremely fast paced environment. Upper Management shows favoritism and creates hostile environment for employees. No work-life balance. Warehouse Supervisor was very knowledgeable and helpful. Lunches were fun as production always brings in lunch.
bad,"3rd shift at the Nashville, Arkansas plant is the worst job I ever had. PAY is terrible for the work and environment. Every surrounding industrial maintenance jobs pays at least $22/hr starting out. That's cap pay for Tyson. 3rd shift works 5-6 days a week with barely a 24hr day off. 1st and 2nd shift gets between 2-4 days off periodically. There isn't a day that goes by when a maintenance supervisor isn't screaming his head off at people because start up isn't going as planned. Everybody there backstabs and starts rumors like 14 year old girls in junior high. Dealing with sanitation during the 3rd shift shut down is a pain in the rear. They are always in the way, and constantly breaking stuff. Every night you get sprayed in the face with chlorine and water. Water drains are constantly getting stopped up because sanitation worker think anything can go in them. I tell everybody who asked me about tyson to stay away from them. Go to Domtar, Firestone, Weyerhauser, or McDonald's."
bad,"Pushing racks in the 28 degree room to the line to put meat on the belt, Keep up with tags to give lead man, Go on blast to help out coworkers, Give our breaks"
bad,While working there if you don’t speak a different language they don’t flex when I worked there I always had to ask about bulletins because they were all in Spanish
bad,Being a MeatPacker was a different experience i do remember it being so COLD. I did have to make sure those packages of chicken was fresh and packed correctly so the boxes can be shipped to its correct destination.
bad,This was a work release job for me as I was transitioning back into society after being in prison for 2 years. This job was extremely cold and unsafe. It is not sanitary nor clean in anyway. The blades for cutting the meat are very sharp and there are many injuries that could occur. I did not like this job one bit and would not recommend this job to anyone.
bad,"First off the stench is horrible. Dead chicken is all you smell all the time. "
bad,stressful at times and lead supervisors would give extra lee way to other ethic groups.it just became stressful to the point where I dreaded to even go to work.
bad,It was realy boring workplace. Menagement was so bad and income was low. Culture was degrade. The hardest part of the job was to hire uneducated people.
bad,"Just getting by,stressful, hard work low pay,unsafe environment dangerous work place,poor management, lack of leadership skills,don't nothing matter but the chicken."
bad,"I did not work for Tyson foods company, I actually worked for a small construction company that went by the named Tyson. I worked mostly as the cleanup crew so I wasn't paid much. The job was a jumping off point."
bad,"I would not recommened anyone to work here , the supervisors suck and the work load is bad , didnt mind the cold but the pay should be more for a million dollar company"
bad,"Awful place to work , Unprofessional Supervisor,Super messy and cold environment.Wouldn’t recommend it to anybody that I know to work there.They work you like a sweatshop"
bad,"I really do not feel comfortable with reviewing this job."
bad,Bad place to work and unfair treatment nasty environment and unclean work space supervisors are very disrespectful and talk to you rude the work you hard and pay you less then any other chicken plant
bad,My Experience as a Maintenance Technician has been an unfullfilling one. Management expects you to work massive amounts of overtime with little or no time off. I have worked a month at a time without a day off several times. There is little motiviation to improve things as your input is neither wanted or valued.
bad,Horrible place to work. Especially when it came to benefits and questions you have. They give you a little card with phone numbers on it and have you call them instead of helping you in office. It’s a joke I don’t recommend anyone to work there!  It’s a joke and your just a number.
bad,Very great paying job for the rural area that it is located in but the drive once again is well over a hour long the sups are not to nice its more like a slave factory
bad,it was a ok place to work at i mean i had a job so i just kept being a good working as usual and tried to come up and be the best i  can be and move on
bad,Tyson fires loyal employess. They didnt pay me my vacation days. All over somethinh that had nothing to do with me. I dont recommend this job to anyone.
bad,Owned the building so basically worked alone. Was a good job but Tyson management was unwilling to discuss job duties. Middle management was dishonest.
bad,"My experience there was a horrible one. I was never mandated to work overtime I always volunteered. It was never appreciated. The supervisors and management spent their time searching for any and every little thing to write you up for. They couldn't train, didn't praise and were always negative. You spent your whole work day looking over your shoulder...walking on eggshells. I busted my butt for that company only to be fired the day after my year anniversary. I was going to get a dollar raise, 2 weeks vacation and 2 floaters. Instead I was fired. Human resources were never available. When they were available whatever your complaint or concerns were went in one ear and out the other. I called corporate to file a complaint and have yet to hear from them after 2 weeks. Tyson is a 42 billion dollar company. You would think that they would treat their employees better than they do. There are no sick days, 2 floaters your first year. We were trying to implement a union and Tyson sent their lawyers and corporate reps to come to the facility and bad mouth it...trying to make sure we didn't get it. All in all I have never worked for a company with a revolving door of employees. Horrible place to work."
bad,Uma empresa onde não respeitam os funcionários a carga horária era utrapassava os limites e não ganhavamos horas extras a estrutura era péssima.
bad,I didn't intend to leave I was injured in a three car crash and found out that I was pregnant and the manager I had fired me because I was on light duty and seeing a chiropractor. I tried return years later and still no luck but ex-cons are hired daily.
bad,I didn't like working there because on floor supervisors seem to like the employees that were brown nosing or kissing up to them and if anyone wasn't was sent to another department or fired and the pay wasn't good either.
bad,Trust me do not work here. They do not pay good money at all. It's always less than 700 a week. You never get home whenever you need to. The fleet managers lack communication. No one picks up the phone when you need them the most.
bad,I worked for Tyson for 4 years in Shipping. First couple of years went smooth and I was impressed by how the treated us. Had perfect attendance those first two years then got custody of my Daughter and being a single Parent my attendance fell off some. Terminated over points when 3 others in my Dpt had the same amount but I wasn't in their good ol boy circle and new Freezer Manager was a back stabber. Wouldn't recommend that place to anyone
bad,It was a nasty ungrateful place to work you have a lot of hate and poor management that love to be in the woman face rather getting things done around the plant Christmas they will give you a $10 gift card with no Christmas bonuses when you thin made them millions throw out the year it’s a sad place to work like for real I won’t consider this for my worst enemy roaches all over the chicken plant I won’t eat or work their
bad,"Work was very tedious as to be expected. Often times I found myself being taken advantage of and doing other people's jobs. Averaged 2-3 days off a month. Worked Sat and frequent Sundays."
bad,"Through my whole time working for Tyson, I was never recognized for my job efforts and never given any opportunity to advance to a better career. There was a lot of favoritism and harassment, I would work a 7 person job with just three people on multiple occasions and never once had any recognition. It is a slave job and pay does not go up, I am making the same as what a new person would make starting out. HR is horrible and I have reported this and was disciplined for reporting harassment."
bad,"if you enjoy having no personal life and being underpaid and underappreciated this job is for you. Management is very under-trained. I wish this was a good place to work but it's simply not, most employees have better management experience and networking skills than the managers themselves."
bad,If you like not having breaks then that's the place to work. The point system is bad. You get point even if the nurse sends you home for being sick and even after you bring back the right paper work
bad,"I have nothing to say, being it has been years since i been there. So therefore i have nothing to really say about them good or bad. My time there maybe different than others."
bad,"Tyson Foods suspend me for a wrong reason. I only had one incident of having a cellphone in a restricted and prohibited area. I was not informed that this area was off limits, no signs of warning was posted."
bad,The supervisors were never inside the plant when you need them. They were ALWAYS outside smoking and talking with other supervisors from different departments.
bad,"It was challenging but also was a learning workplace."
bad,"Work place was cold, water on floor, staff was disrespectful cruel. An hour before getting off we would be told 1 or 2 hours over. Tyson is a fast pace environment."
bad,"If you went to college, avoid this company at all costs if you work at the plant. They treat you like an animal and you work with complete degenerate people."
bad,When I worked there it was not a good place to work. You would go in at 6:00 and would never know what time you were going to leave and it was very stressful back then.
bad,Very unprofessional environment. Employees work 6 to 7 days a week. The hardest part of the job is you can not leave the assembly line at all. nothing fun about this place.
bad,It’s a lot of work. Very fast pace. The trainer needs help to understand how to properly train anyone that come to do that type of work. After so many days everyone complains about hurting joints
bad,"the day always started with a group talk. I learned to become the best sanitation worker in the plant. management was that great. the work place was awesome, when you could alternate between the warm side and cold side. the hardest part of the job was passing inspection with USDA. The most exciting part of the job would have been lunch with the crew."
bad,You had to use a high pressure hose to clean everything. It was to hard for me. You stay wet the whole time & I ended up getting sick from it. So I had to leave because it wasnt a job for me.
bad,This job was contracted out after I left so I wouldn't go back . had a terrible experience. With management showing favoritism. Plant manager was firednot long after I left.
bad,"Tyson's offers no pay increases at all  for loyalty or job performance no matter if you just started or have for 20 years.  The only way to make more money there is to actually switch positions--aside from the nominal across the board cost of living increase."
bad,Bad management at Tyson...over all pay is good but tyson is a non union plant and uses its management to manipulate its employees...it was a start up plant so alot of management was new to being supervisors.....made the work place very hostile.
bad,I left this place for a reason they believe you don't need a life when you work for them. They take a position away and drop your pay with no notice and then when the position comes back they give it to someone else
bad,"Run away. Make a suggestion and get fired. Will terminate in a heart beat. No rules. Middle Management will trash you, if you want to help changer to a more positive environment."
bad,"Would not recommend working at this place.  Long hours, poor benefits and low wages.  Leadership at the facility is not professional.  Would not work there again."
bad,"Poor management on night shift. Short of staff, people abuse the bathroom breaks. Never know when you getting off on Friday. Disrespectful people there."
bad,Very hard work and stressful. also place is not sanitary and working environment is tough. On feet all day dont expect to get much raises working for this company.
bad,This job I worked in the freezer and it was a labor job with a lot of repetitive moving and numbness because of the cold. Management was very stand on demanding.
bad,I would not recommend the company to nobody. This job is very under paid for the work that is required of you. You have to work in very cold temperatures.
bad,"Okay job, hard work required and the line leads are not very friendly and they are always on with their stopwatches, and not considerate when the workers have to use the bathroom"
bad,I worked here for awhile the people are great some are mean but most are nice people. They need to work more with single  mothers its hard to do everything yourself..
bad,I absolutely do not recommend anyone for employment they will work you into the grave and take all the credit for anything that you have done or tried to do awful place to work
bad,If anyone has any sense stay away from this business. If the personell don't like you you don't stand a chance. Nothing good to say about this place of business.
bad,Tyson's is a place where I would not seen Family or friends there. Management there are not good manager. When I work there I felt like I was in prison working there.
bad,"Tyson was a big corporation that treated their employees unfairly. Low pay rate and over worked. No time off unless a vacation day was used, and then it still was unapproved."
bad,I loved my job overall but the upper management was horrible and inappropriate but I did learn a lot from my coworkers just wish they would treat their employees better
bad,"fast pace working environment , happy place nice people , great opportunity to work for this company plenty of work and a lot of OT required the hardest part about this job is keeping up with the pace"
bad,I do not like the company the people are mean and I just don't want to be there anymore the superior was mean and so not understanding they look down at you like your nothing to them I hate it there
bad,Good benefits but the production isn't ran properly due to poor decisions being made by upper management. Supervisors hired outside of Tyson get paid more than the supervisors hired within the plant and they have to help train the new supervisor.
bad,Say one thing but do the opposite. There mind set is one way & if you don't  do it the way of the plant Manager then you won't make it. Smile in your face & laugh at you once your gone.
bad,"Dont work at Tyson Amarillo , people are rude, and supervisors dont care about you at all , rude supervisors and treat you very bad they speed up the chain to go fast and if you get hurt they get mad at you and scream at you. Plain and simple dont work for tyson amarillo."
bad,"They promise you advancement,  good pay,  equality,  and a friendly work environment.  None of that is true.  They have a no retaliation policy about complaints,  comments,  or concerns.  It is lie.  If you make someone mad in management,  or say something they don't like.  They will make your life there difficult and do what is necessary to get you fired.  If you are a female working in live production do not think for one second that you will advance any further than your hired in position.  I wasted 2 years of my life working under false promises."
bad,"Company  worst place to work at management  team  sleep with employees nasty place never keep building clean . Management,human resources are cons get you in there soon your probation over they lie to get you out your job."
bad,I worked on the production line.(3 months)You get a trainer for two weeks and they would yell at the new employees.  I did report it but nothing was done. They prefer mexicans. They do not like whites or blacks .
bad,was a very tough place to work..all about who you know and not knowledge to grow in company.. alot of hiring and firing do to improper management.
bad,"Tyson Foods in Shelbyville, Tennessee has eliminated Labor Day as a paid holiday in favor of the last day of Ramadan. I will no longer patronize any Tyson company, products nor sponsored events. It's just one more little chunk of America that's been bitten off. If we don't stand up for something we will fall for anything. All it takes for evil to triumph is for good people to do nothing. The best way to send them the message that they made the wrong decision is to not support Tyson and do not buy Tyson products!"
bad,"Take associate machinery and piping , pumps apart for cleaning. Repair whatever need to be repair or replace and then re-assemble for morning start-up."
bad,"It would not be so bad if it was not a click type of company."
bad,I've work for Tyson for 4 years 6 to 7 days a week and all they ever do is expect more of your time and wanna pay u less for it.the Tyson core motto is Tyson fist family second and free time and your life last. whatever u do do not  go to work for Tyson.
bad,been there 2 year but sometime it just out of control and it seem like management doest care about employees.....but really appreciates about line leader
bad,"freezing cold, management is backwards, they don't care about the employees other than to cover their own butts! Too much fraternization between employees and management. Education means nothing. Hardest part is being treated like lower than the cows you're cutting on, upside is you get paid weekly but $300 a week for all the physical isnt worth it"
bad,They treat you like a dog. Supervisors care absolutely nothing for you unless you are a pretty female. The will use Company policy to suit their own needs.
bad,"Very cold and Dangerous work environment, long work days standing in one spot for 12 Hours. Very hard work for a laborer with very little pay"
bad,"It's a shamed a big company like Hillshire/Tyson operates by employee has no leadership, poor management. They don't care about employees at all, what they care is to work them employees like hebrew slave!"
bad,"I have been with Tyson for 11 years,hope to be able to work at least 10 more if able. They are a good place to work but need to pay more money .I started out on DSI and didn't like it,did rework but wasn't always work for a shift,hardest job at work is not one because I haven't had a reason except for would like more money. People are great and friends too help.Getting along with bosses is good"
bad,"A typical day at work consist of wonderful customers."
bad,"Tyson is one of the worse jobs in pine bluff. They have very short breaks, the supervisor will lie on you. They will try to get you fired."
bad,it is an ok job they work you long hours but its good pay and the poeple i worked with was nice nd they gave you the oppertunity to move around the plant and learned diuffrent things
bad,"Tyson Food Inc was good company even though it was very hard task that i used to do, because i was machine operator in order to process the meat, however, their benefits was good for example health coverage."
bad,"I have been working at tyson a while, I have learn how to make boxes, how to bag the boxes, how to weight the chicken , how to put the top on the boxes,, how to talley by using the scan gun to scan the label on the leg quarter boxes. The management of this job was wrong, everything just was not fair. The c0-worker I had to deal with, was hard to deal with, nobody I would not wanna deal with, with other jobs. The hardest parts of the job is theco-workers. The most enjoyable part of the job was gettting pay."
bad,they dont care about the people that work for them they only care about the chicken. A person died on the line and they just kept right on working and let the poor guy lay on the floor cold.
bad,"Since Tyson bought out Hillshire it has turned into a nightmare. No communication. 10+hr days 7 days a week. No end in sight. Tons of work not enough people. At this place its all about ""its not about who you know its about who you blow"" ."
bad,Some co workers within the company cannot read or write. Employees in management are not qualified to perform their positions.
bad,"I like it, but I just want to try something diferent for my family"
bad,"They would send many people home, due to lack of work.  Then they mandated you be there on the weekend."
bad,"I worked as a team member, supervisor trainee, trainer, safety rep and ergonomics monitor. I was able to learn a variety of jobs very quick in order to advance throughout the company"
bad,"It is a nice place to work.I worked for this company for 13 years. I used to on slices sides trimming, cutting, styling, driving the mules. On the packing areas, i used to pack products by sorting them by labels to prevent the mispacks. Also used to train all new employees before starting on any new jobs. Explained jobs safety analysis to the employees before starting a new job."
bad,The job was okay but management could have been more professional
bad,If u want to spend time with your family take my advice and stay where you are at. Tyson have poor management the work place is very nasty and u work every saturday no weekends off they done have good befits and the pay is not good at all so take my advice and stay where you are at.
bad,"A typical day at work was fast paced and terrible. I didn't learn anything. Management was decent. My co workers nice and I enjoyed their company. The hardest part of the job was, working on the production line. I didn't enjoy any part of the job at all."
bad,"What they talk and have on paper is not what they do. Management does not care about safety, rules, policies, nothing. At this plant, most of them are related to, friends with or in a relationship with most of the line workers and will not say anything if they violate the rules. Most of the line workers have multiple facial piercings, false eyelashes and nails, no hearing protection and the supervisors turn their head to it because they don't want to say anything. If you report a violation, they have very sneaky ways of retaliation. You have to watch your back with everybody. They also cut hours and do not rotate. This plant is a nightmare."
bad,not a good place to work management does not take the employees serious.
bad,Very dissappointed and not a very good company to work for. Very very dissappointed.
bad,"they don't treat everyone fair and they play favorites, and if you get hurt you might as well find a new job, I personal was on work release from a DR. and even used my weak of vacation the week I was off and they gave me points every day that week and fired me, the managers were rude and mean for no reason, the co-workers were great and fun to be around, the hardest part of the job was putting up with the managers, the most enjoyable part was the funny guys I worked with other then that nothing they tried to work you to death and not pay you enough for it I went back a second time and realized why I left the first time there is no way id go back or recommend anyone to go once"
bad,"The plant stunk all the time. You was always stepping on raw meat, The raises were terrible. USDA shut the Spring Grove facility down"
bad,I would work with individuals who act immature and would rather play than work. The only thing I have learned is to just do my work and do not worry about others. Co workers are immature and like to start drama. There is no hard part of the job most of it is common sense.
bad,i only worked there for the summer. Ilearned how to make tacos. I did not get to know many co workers because we were moved around ofton and worked at a fast pace.I did not like this job at all we normally worked 12 to 13 days strait and had to request a day off
bad,Its all just a number game. Upper Management shows no remorse for  anyone.
bad,"Morale is at an unbelievable all time low. Avoid this joke of a new culture company if you are looking for employment. An HR manager position has been open for several months; does that tell you something? Management is so disconnected from the ranks, and even at HQ. No one gives a you know what unless it affects them personally. So as long as the CEO's ego is fed by his goofy plans and all the SLT and VP's are doing well with big homes, summer homes, private schools, plush vacations, and keep their spouses in jewelry and furs life is good ( for them!)."
bad,slow and boring with very cold temps on feet in one spot for 7 hours.
bad,"16 hour days and I never know where they will send me or what job I will be doing day to day. Management doesn't care about the employees, the more you give of yourself to this company the more they take."
bad,"16 hour days and you never know where they will send you or what job you will be doing. Management doesn't care about the hours you put in, how it effects your family life, the more of yourself you give them the more they will take."
bad,"Working for tyson was horrible, they treated their employees bad"
bad,"Muito ruim trabalhar na Tyson do Brasil, pois além de pagar mal os funcionários, ainda os tratam como indigentes."
bad,3rd shift was a stedy job kept you buisy and i learned alot about the electrical work. the managment was laid back but had a backbone and over all wasvery good. my co workers was good workers but some wanted to do things there way and not the right way. the hardest part about this job was putting up with the other employees BS.. the best part about the job is if you do you work and learn from everone and everything you could step up in your position in no time.
bad,"would drive a cab first. management is dishonest, does not protect you, lousy environment"
bad,"the maintenance manger brings in church items such as bibles and wants us to pray and puts up the 10 commandants on the walls, lies to the workers and gives every worker the run around the hr dept never comes to work and then when she does come to work she shuts her door and wont speak to any body sara lee is a joke and treats there employees like they are trash worst place ever to work"
bad,Unprofessional people in upper management which caused stress in every department.
bad,"Most of the people that work there are ill-tempered, use provocative language, cause problems with other employees, etc. The employers make you show up to an unscheduled day upon a moment's notice. There are many things that need to be changed about this business in order for it to be a place worth working at."
bad,Come in slice pepperoni and leave felt like a zombie and I was on 3rd shift
bad,not a good place because they have poor bosses who lie to there employees
bad,"The number of work hours required is in poor ratio to pay scale. Management frequently sits behind their desks and watches video feeds trying to find ways they can fire someone, so if you are not well liked, they will indeed find a way to get rid of you. HR is an absolute joke. They do nothing to assist employees but bend over backwards to make sure management is kept happy"
bad,"Tyson foods is a unfair place to work. The environment, the management, rules, & policy doesn’t add up. It’s difficult to perform task working in a poor environment."
bad,Very discriminating towards variety of cultures!! Watched supervisor act like they was choking a Hispanic lady from behind. Reported and Nothing happened!! If your not a Supervisor then you are nothing! They could care less about employees. Employees are disposable and just another number!!! It takes 45 Working days to work off a single point for being absent. So Approximately 2 months without being late or missing a day.
bad,My mgr had flu. HR mgr would not let him go home. Mgt terrible. Low pay.. I had a plant mgr worked for company 28 yrs and they fired him and most of all mgrs below him.
bad,HR is a hundred percent on all latino/ Hispanics It has happened to me no matter what if you are not able to speak Spanish and have any issues or report someone that is hispanic and the other is not. HR will do everything she can to turn the blame on the other person. Left after 4yrs almost to sprvser due to this
bad,"Mandatory 7 day work week for months and supervisors that would rather kick up their feet in their office reading a book than help their forever-short-staffed employees. They have their own nurse which sounds great until her catch phrase to LITERALLY every aliment is ""ice it and take ibprophen three times daily"". "
bad,"long hours, most employees make $11 an hour and forced to work overtime around 50 hours a week. "
bad,"The hours were long, working 40 to 60 hours a week, with the expectation of working 7 days a week in the near future. Poor management and no consideration for employee work/life balance."
bad,"This place suks stay clear,bad he bad company insurance ,over worked and work 7 day a week over14 hours a day I sprained my muscle in my back and they wouldn't send me to dr."
bad,"Hostel work environment, supervisor was very aggressive. Remember anything you do must be approved and most importantly signed. Do not take anyones word for anything there."
bad,Hours cut as soon as start working there. The trainers are people that should not be training. Lost most of work to another warehouse . Great if you enjoy the cold and leadership that is only in charge because they have been there the longest.
bad,you have you free time and happiness taken away if you work in a position that just doesn’t function half of the time due to outdated equipment. It is 2019 and they have machines from 2005 that half if not more of the machine doesn’t work for a majority of the day which puts you behind the quota and makes you work weekends. If you don’t want to develop depression then don’t work here.
bad,"Tyson has been under the same management in different departments for 30+ years. Some of these managers are more about attacking employees for making simple learning mistakes, rather than teaching them the proper way. The idea that ""we need to create a training way to prevent team members from getting written up for the things they do not know"" is nonexistent here. Management is a revolving door, due to the chaos that runs through the plant. Pay is low, and you are at the mercy of superiors, which means ""don't bring it up"", to get a raise. This is not a ""job performance"" based raise, as they say in the beginning. People have been here 115 years without a raise. I could go on for days....just not a great place to work all the way around."
bad,"Managers are 2-faced"
bad,"It's decent money, I how ever don't think it's worth it from the way the treat you. This is just coming from my employment at the Finney Coutny location."
bad,My day at work is like a rat race after clocking in waiting in a long unorganized line and being around loud ignorant people yelling for no reason to get your work equipment. The smell is foul you will never get used to it when walking to your department. If you are working on a line its fast paced have to catch on quickly or else you may get sent to another department. The supervisors here tend to show favoritism to certain individuals and let certain people get away with doing things they don't have no business the men supervisors tend to let ladies that are attractive do what they want to do and supervisors that are related to the employee or known the employee before they got hired gets favored as well. this is the most strict plant I worked for I feel like Im back in highschool get suspended for sagging and or cursing but its ok because I guess they want you to look professional the hardest part about the job is depending on where your at because all departments don't work the same but theirs some that will try to force you to work in other areas after your work is completed for the day. And when the plant operates on Saturday most of the time the job that you do isn't even available for work and you get sent to another department to work or if you go home they give you a point and what's the point of doing that if your job is not running right? I don't suggest people eat out the cafeteria because the cafe workers have good days and bad days and they are so slow at giving people their foods and the line is long and most of the time if your not the first when its time to
bad,"Unless you are starving and near destitute, don't work at Tyson. You think because it's a large company they will have their $h!+ together. They don't!"
bad,nobody wants to be there very poor management all supervisors have their favorites and if its not you well sorry bout your problem everyone complains all day about something
bad,"It’s VERY unorganized, Supervisors and HR forget about stuff, Don’t care about others, Very rude, Don’t want to pay us like that! Always making us work our tails off with little pay. It’s pretty much A LOT of BS! I ABSOLUTELY WILL NOT RECOMMEND A PERSON TO WORK HERE AT ALL..... VERY STRESSFUL!!!!! I repeat, VERY STRESSFUL. Plus, It’s VERY favoritism. SMH...... It’s a A LOT OF THAT!!!!! Telling the truth."
bad,It was fast paced and yuu had to keep up labeling boxes so the line wouldn't stop. You had to pack that meat at a high speed depending on how fast the line ran. You had two 30 minutes break.
bad,"Nice place to work,if you want to do your job and your co-workers to.Very lazy co-workers and supervisors.Supervisors and leads don't care about nothing,except sitting in their office and picking up their pay check at the end of the week"
bad,"Turning in things and issues to hotline does no good for loyal or other employees they are based on who runs the show. Pay grades are lower then average , mandatory overtime."
bad,"Low pay, poor miles. ""Good ole boys club"". Lies ,lies and more lies..."
bad,"Workers support of one another when in need was perhaps the best thing going for Tyson, but no thanks to the company for that. Whenever a job threatening problem would occur for which a supervisor was to be held accountable the supervisors were in the habit of shifting the blame and placing it on their subordinate workers as a way of covering their own rear-ends. Management would always be complicit in these workplace crimes of theirs and in some instances guilty of committing their own"
bad,"The job has been challenging, but very unrewarding. The Production team members and supervisors are constantly changing parameters on certain machines to speed up production and by doing so cause unnecessary down time."
bad,"The company was transitioning from a small, family owned company to a major corporation, however the company did not want to remain in Chicago. Company has since closed."
bad,If you don't have a family or enjoy spending time with your family this is the place for you!  Long unexpected hours and little to no notice.  would no recommend!
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of doing the job of two people with little to no supervision. "
bad,"It is all about who you know and not what you know. The rules only apply to everyone but management. People are treated like employees and not team members, meaning they come to work because they have and because they want to. The work atmosphere and culture is product driven. Its all about the yield no matter the sacrifice."
bad,"The job at Tyson foods required me to work 7 days a week and had a point system if you wanted to take off. "
bad,the job is only a paycheck. the hours are terrible they say some overtime required. but you work over 40 hours a week. You work 8hr days 6 days a week and at the very last minute they will tell you that you need work your day off even if you aren't scheduled to work. the entire place is in disarray. really not much of a chance for advancement at all. the place is not very professional. the best part of the job is the every week paycheck. the job is very time consuming and leaves no time for family life
bad,Stacked racks on conveyors and trucks for dog treats. Was very unorganized and had poor management. There was never enough people working to run both lines.
bad,"typical day at work is frustrating, I didn't learn anything, the managers were very rude and don't know how to talk to people not once on the job did they tell us what we needed to do they just say get to work. the co-workers some are plesant and others complain. the hardest part of the job is not knowing what to do and having to just watch others to find out what it is that you have to do but once u know itz not as bad and the most enjoyable part was lunch break"
bad,Typical day was boring. I learned that if you did what supposed to do would get you fired. Management does not know how company should be run. co workers do what they want to not what supposed to do.
bad,The place is like high school all over again and you never kno what time you getting off.
bad,"Everyday was a nightmare. Not being able to have your own ideas. Being micromanaged everyday. Not given all the tools needed to complete a job task, but still held accoutableto complete task in timely manner."
bad,"Like most employees of this company I wound up here after the company that I worked for was taken over by Sara Lee. They are greedy, unfocused and in far to deep with businesses in which they have absolutely no expertise. Upper management was constantly in flux and often saddled with baggage that they were not prepared to deal with. They were responsible for the demise of many respected brands in the United States."
bad,"Working for Tyson Foods was an bad experience for me.... I hate everything about the job.. the envirement,people and the cold...they dont care about you are your feelings"
bad,When you look at this company you can tell why it came out of crooked Arkansas.  Tysons were known for hiring black people to exploit cheap labor until Mexicans came and we're outlawed by the government. All you need to know is chicken is important and the workers are not.
bad,"Unfair management, "
bad,Pay is horrible! An management is horrible! They treat you like horrible human beings! An they are nosey they pry into your personal life an stick their nose where it doesn't belong!.
bad,"Management let's the Line leads talk to you how ever, they mistreat workers and half train you! Worst place I've ever worked in! Do not go to this place for your 1st plant job cause they do not care about you what's so ever!"
bad,DO anything and everything to get the schedule done even if its not my job. Heavy lifting and trying to get stuff done while seeing other steal company time
bad,Managements have favorites and they get the good jobs. Management only time certain people. Don’t waste your time. To much drama! Can’t have a life cause you never know when you are going to work the weekends.
bad,No room for advancement management is crooked they allow leads and others not so high up in command basically a worker to take the fall as far as write ups etc dumb 3 day suspensions. Over populated with Mexicans
bad,I got sick when I worked there.  I went to the doctors office brought back a note and never returned.  When I triedntontellHRn I had a note the man got uset with me and did not want to talk to me
bad,"I worked here for over two years. Management is ridiculous. Good, hard work goes unnoticed. Advancement only happens if your from the ""in"" crowd regardless of work ethic or attendance. Everything is racial, from where you work to the job you do. The supervisors do whatever they want with ZERO repercussions. So if they dont like you or what race you are expect a lot a BS."
bad,Plant is run like they see no future. Expect to be asked to work without resources and meet demanding and near impossible goals. Also you will be given contradictory goals frequently.
bad,Tyson sucks. Run away fast!!! Do not let your wife or daughters work here. This place will suck the life out of you.  The food sucks and restrooms so nasty and broken. I can not stress how bad this place is.
bad,"Tyson offers decent pay, however you will be worked until there is nothing left. The hours are horrible, you will be working 10-12 hours a day with mandatory Saturdays every weekend. You will not have a life outside of work because all of your time will be spent sleeping or at work. This place expects so much out of you but offers very little appreciation."
bad,When I came home from  incarceration  They was hiring and my mother was working there and she put me on to the job did my interview and got the job. Working there was very hard and difficult at the beginning but once I got the job down pack I was very good at it
bad,You have to fight tooth and nail to get a raise even when its test based.pay is below everybody else not to mention. You are expected to do everybody else’s job for them. Sometimes you lieterally have to do that job.Maintenance is not respected what so ever your pretty much treated like an entry level position if not worse. It makes almost impossible to actually be able to do your job. Management doesn’t really care what so ever there just there for a pay check.
bad,"They have ongoing rule changes that are always for the worse. They change your job with no increase in pay or a grace period. The point system is not realistic, especially if you have children, are sick and etc. The lunch break is rushed. Bathroom breaks are a joke. Since I left they've closest the cafeteria and taken their lockers. It's alot of favoritism. The nurses dont care and all the good people in HR have left. It's survival of the fittest to say the least. Supervisors tend to treat you like you're a child (beneath them). The wrong people are in charge! Ohhh and don't let you have to go to THEIR Dr who is mostly guaranteed to say nothing is wrong with you no matter what. I don't know anyone who has ever got unemployment from them, they'll deny and fight you for it. They tried to fire me on maternity leave. I had 2 months off because of C-section (you get 1 with natural birth). I was off about 2 weeks and they sent me a letter of termination. Was so sick at work and nurses would not send me home. Have to take a point. If you need a job, go ahead and work there to get on your feet but this is not a place if want to stay. I went to work for 2 years and ended up there for almost 12 just due to life and no time to really do anything else."
bad,They do not care because so many people go there to work they see everyone as dispensable and could care less what happens to you they will do everything they can to get you out of the company if you threaten their money
bad,"Benefits great, pay was decent, but unfortunately there was no way to further your career or advance unless you relocate or just took advantage of others misfortune. The management was awful, simply playing favorites so much so they didn't even do their jobs or answer questions about how to complete ""work"" assigned to the ""hourly workers "" . I could go on but won't because I hope they fix their weak links in management."
bad,Tyson was ok to work at it was just that some people would fall behind on purpose and you would have to pick up there slack and the run the machine fast and product  will hit the floor and the supervisor or the lead will stand there and look at them struggle instead of helping. I observed all this from Line 5. They act like they too pretty and not be looking like a stepped on chicken nugget
bad,"Was a terrible company to work for, everyone has their opinion though. There is not much work in these areas. They would write me up if someone messed something up while i was on break off the clock still because they have lack of communication skills."
bad,"They don't care about their employees, only care about pushing....many people can't wait to get out. Hires many illegals with fake papers. Very hard to move up in the company."
bad,If you like working your butt off without rewards then Tyson is your place.. Management has no idea what they are doing. There are annual raises but everyone makes the same.
bad,"Tyson was a good place until Hillshire took control of the company.  The SVP of my department was only interested in how he looked and not about the people.  He would make promises in department meetings and then when it came time for follow through his promises were never kept.  If you bid on a job within the company, it is acceptable to refuse pay increases.  I was told that they department did not want to invest in me while I was applying for other jobs within the company.  This was brought to the attention of ethics help line and they were okay with this action.  a decade ago, this was a good company.  When I left it was not."
bad,It was a terrible place to work and I would not wish it on my worst enemy.   Management is a joke and they don't listen to their employees.   best thing that could have happened was losing that job
bad,Was very unsatisfying. Very cut throat. Not loyal at all. Managment full of crime and drug abusers. Full of racism. Dirty building. I would never work there again
bad,"This company talks about values and respecting their team members. There is nothing farther from the truth, they do not hold to their words and the turn over rate for this company is bad for a reason."
bad,"you will work hard and at times you leave from there feeling like your efforts are not even appreciated . There are times you can't or plan things with your family for the weekend because they will say you have to work on Saturday, and a lot of the you will not receive a 24 hour notice."
bad,Just wasn't a good job for me in the end after so many years of changes and not for the better. Overall lack of communication between departments affects work for team members
bad,"The don't give enough time for bathroom breaks, The discriminate people with disabilities, Hostile work environment that no one should have to put up with."
bad,It's was okay just was to cold then sometimes you get wet up... I didn't like cutting chicken because it had my rist hurting all day everyday.. but it was some friendly people there
bad,"One of the worst places that I've ever worked. Employees are forced to work 6 - 7 days a week, up to 12 hours a day. Management is unknowledgeable and refuses to provide the proper time or materials to perform job functions. Equipment doesn't get cleaned properly due to reduced cleaning cycles caused by production running later than they're supposed to."
bad,Tyson does not take care of their senior members. They start new hires out more or the same per hour as the team members that have been there for years.
bad,"The work environment can be stressful- the balance between work and life is skewed. There is a great deal of work to manage and not a great deal of help."
bad,Positive review for IT is obviously fake. 90+ people just got laid off in IT department. You never know from day to day if you have a job regardless of how hard you work. 5c's are a joke at this company. Managers do not follow 5C's.
bad,"I was not able to withstand the extremely cold conditions. It is not at all a sociable place, you are at conveyer all day. I don't recommend this job it also smells horrible inside and outside."
bad,If working 12-14 hours everyday and coming home smelling of chicken insides is your thing then look no further.  they crack the whip everyday and want you to work hard with no relief or back up.  Some of the supervisors there are good and motivate the workers but they are quickly rid of in favor of those that only want to meet the bottom line.
bad,"Worked for this company for almost 12 years,cold wet,unfair treatment by managment.Loved working just management needs skills as to dealing with employees."
bad,in the morning I start out with making the schedule and making sure that we have enough raw product to make the amount of trays we need to fill. then I get the line set up and ready to run and make sure everyone is on time and in the proper spot. then I check and make sure everyone has the proper ppe needed to do there job.
bad,This can be a good place to work. Some of the management need to be replaced or retrained on interpersonal communication. The hardest part of the job is standing in one spot.
bad,"Tyson finds workers that will actually work and then over works them has them pick up the slack for all the other workers that are lazy, if a job position comes open and you bid for the job if you are not good friends with a supervisor you will not get the position."
bad,"I would not recommend working here.  Expect corporate attitude, very bloated upper/middle management made up of people who are out of touch with plant operations and methods, and long work hours.  "
bad,"Nobody cares about you at that place. The pay is what keeps you there. The management has ""cliques"" and the only way to move up is to join one. Everyone hates their job. The hours are lousy; some weeks you work a lot, some you get sent home early. Overall I wouldn't recommend it to an enemy."
bad,"Third worst company I have ever worked for. Advances in pay grade for mechanics are not based on knowledge, experience or showmanship but rather how many levels of computer based training you get accomplished on top of your work day."
bad,"I worked here for 3 years and the entire time, I thought it was a joke!  There is no room for advancement unless you have a degree in something. (No matter how many years experience you have).  If you have a problem and want to talk to someone about it, don't go to HR, they are a joke!  I even went as far as speaking with the CEO about the company and my manager and NOTHING got done over it.  I always felt like I could never do enough of my job correctly to get approval from management.  They never gave raises or bonuses!  I worked 6 days a week with promises of having off and then ended up having to come in anyway!  As far as the quality of things, it is HORRIBLE!! They do not care about safety or their employees.  As a QA, it doesn't matter if you're going by the spec, if it upsets one person in management, they release it anyway.  Even if it doesn't abide by what the customers want.  They make you feel like your job is IRRELEVANT!! Do NOT work here!!!!"
bad,if you are a family person this job is not for you''long hours you never know when you getting off// people are not friendly ''
bad,"There are 4 shifts that are 12 hours long each. I would get to work at 6:20 am and work till 6:45 pm 3 days a week and 6:20 am - 12:15pm one day a week. While my time at Tyson, I learned how to drive a forklift and not to trust anyone you work with. Management is a joke here. They will tell you one thing and do right the opposite. Co-workers was okay. The best part of my job was the pay check at the end of the week. I made a few friends, but it is hard for a woman to work with a ratio of 8 woman to 45 men."
bad,Google Tyson Foods and Felonies!!! Crooked company. Applicant beware!! Preach a good sermon but business conducted behind closed doors by the good old boys is quite a different story! Pressure to produce yield numbers causes all kinds of interesting accounting methods and if you ask questions you are branded a non-team player.
bad,its ok. it is a job but I really don't care for this type of work. it is too much drama. short breaks and a lot of drama between employees. you get really messy if you are a trimmer.
bad,Very stressful and very poor management. There was no room to advance at that location. One of my co-worker made it a very hostile work environment daily. And it was just terrible overall for me.
bad,"They care nothing about their employees and since they have no worker's union, they work employees like slaves."
bad,"management was terrible      when Tyson took over moral went down hill              my co workers I got along with great       I had some very hard jobs ,I had jobs that were so hard that I didn't know if I could make it through the day.     I always tried to have fun on the job when it was possible"
bad,"If one did not play the game, one got written up, demoted, or fired."
bad,The work was unorganized and unprofessional. Half the time you didnt even know what you were doing. misleading information. Throwing you around from job to job. It was not a good job at all
bad,"Do not be fooled into remotely thinking this is a good place to work.  Many people are leaving or actively looking for a new job.  The only people that are happy are those that aren't very good anyway.  The company despite what management will tell you, is not doing well.  There is definitely no job security here.  Middle management is very incompetent.  I bet you could eliminate that whole Senior Manager level and actually get better results!  I find it tough every day to even pretend to care that I work here.  The quality of people they hire is mediocre at best.  I find myself actually getting dumber by the day."
bad,I actually like the job I am doing but have some major concerns! I have to drive a hour away to get to my job. Employees don't get any raises and currently cant get 40 hrs. a week. The Union doesn't help hard working people and wont let you get out the union after requesting it. I feel like they are breaking some kind of labor laws. I would love to see changes but don't know where to start or who to talk to because the people in HR gives people run around.
bad,"If you are looking for a professional place to work...keep moving."
bad,"Unless you are a poultry person, find another place to go. I would not work here again regardless of compensation. Management at VP level is dishonest, lies, hypocritical, and lazy. 6 to 6 is expected hours, co workers are in silos. Terrible environment at corporate."
bad,At this job you are on your feet for at leat 9 hrs at a rime and the temperature is 35-37 degrees at the warmest.
bad,"not much to say, many years and then nothing, keep who they wanted,"
bad,I devoted over 20 years to Tysons and should have never started there. Saw people treated poorly on a daily basis. I had many jobs there including Supervisor. I was forced to quit by management for reporting workplace abuse. Do not work for this company. They treat people poorly. I wasted 20 years devoted to
bad,"This Job Has LONG hours and Hours that are not typically ""work hours."" There is very little communication within the company and many times it cost the person running the route $$ out of there commisition. Also Sara Lee was Just bought out by Bimbo Bakeries and there are gonna be many changes in the near future."
bad,Horrible place to work at I dont reccomend it if you want to go waste your time go ahead the supervisors were not helpful at all eaither the pay was alright
bad,"Not a good place to work. Don’t recommend, there is no work/personal life balance. Management unprofessional and rude and have favoritism going on a lot."
bad,"Terrible morale. They do not encourage a team player mentality. Everyone is out for themselves. They sabotage shipments, they know who is doing it, and the same workers are getting all the overtime hours. They spend more time covering their butts, and blaming each other than producing profits. Tshareholders"
bad,"Low salaries for hard labor jobs. Raises are never big or what they should be.  Debone and live hanging don't make a liveable check but we are worked like slaves. Years ago this chicken pot on the name of the slave plantation plant. By many people, simply because ,hard work extra work very very little pay"
bad,"This place works people to hard for the money. People who don't have a diploma, felony records, shady immigration status and just a lack of self worth, it's right for them. A 3 day brain boggling orientation and meet all the management. They like to tell people that you can be a manager like us someday if you stick with it. No way to opt out of health insurance."
bad,If u work there make sure its only temporary. The supervisors are only there to make money. They do not care about your well being or nothing else. You cannot take your vacation days when you want to. They have alot of prejudice people there.
bad,The management makes you feel like your worthless to them and it really shows in the attitude of everyone that works there. I felt like I could be quickly and easily replaced by the way my supervisor treated me just because I was young.
bad,The higher ups don’t know a thing they are doing and over all it’s a nasty factory. Over all your co-workers are the best thing about the factory. Cause management really sucks.
bad,People are rude and say really mean and unfitting words for work.  Supervisors are also rude and do not address the people that cuss. They let the workers do practically what ever they want when it comes to respecting others. Every time I have quit is because of conflict and supervisors not protecting the people who are innocent they protect the people they are more friends with.
bad,Bad place to work it's so cold in there. Sometime they scream to you. The supervisor is nice but she wants more and more production every day they push you a lot.
bad,I spent almost 9 years there and learned everything in the Dry Sausage department. There was an non work related event in my life that caused stress and conflict at work. I was given a suspension and while on that suspension was let go. While less than 6 months after that a female employee there had a similar situation and was given a short leave to figure things out and welcomed back. I spent 9 years learning a perfecting what I could do to help that place succeed and she had less than a year there. Not a place that treats its employees like they are important.
bad,"Been their for 2 year was good my first year in then plant managers change, they don't keep consistent start ups. Wont let you know your working weekend until friday of. Our equipment that we need to do our job always break and never get fixed the right way."
bad,They don't treat the employees fairly. Barely anyone speaks English. The supervisors don't know what's going on half the time. Management is poor. The cafeteria and bathrooms are nasty a complete health hazard. People don't use the toilets they put there used paper in the trash rather then flush. Over all it's gross unhealthy and bad pay.
bad,"There is gender discrimination and excessive favoritism in the Pasco Plant.  Nothing is ever done when an issue is reported.  There is excessive retaliation against those that report issues that are still ongoing at this plant, and family members of those in upper management are promoted left and right."
bad,"The general workers, and front line supervisor are all really great people.  However mid and upper management isn't so great.  The push the work force to work harder and faster.  The work force constantly exceeds productions goals.  All we get is more work, and maybe a free lunch once a month."
bad,The job was very fast paced half of the time I never got the breaks like I was supposed to. I was also having to do jobs I was not trained for. They treat their employees very unfair.
bad,"Only work here if you're really desperate for a job, you'll smell disgustingly like chicken every day you leave, its pretty much fend for yourself, no one really helps you with your job."
bad,"My opinion about this job is that it's not something I want to turn into a career, because the pay sucks and you can't live off of a $300 dollar check."
bad,"Horrible place to work. Management doesn’t care, 1st shift is lazy, union is falling apart. Hours are basically nonexistent and you are treated like garbage and have no rights."
bad,My experience was not a positive one with in the company.  Upper Management did not follow proper policies and procedures.  I believe the location I worked at needs an overhaul in management.
bad,basically stood on the line and packaged product into the boxes and made sure that their were no unsafe product gong out.. was hot and had to wear all the PPE .
bad,I worked live hang and if you dont mind getting the nasty stuff on you its not a bad job its actually good paying job but its not for the typical person looking for a job
bad,was OK working there mostly cold but I got to meet new people and learn new things about Tyson inc I would rate them 5 stars.very productive and safe place to work at. Pros. Good food and nice pay. Cons.
bad,Tip many favorites. Bad management no one is held accountable for their actions. They don't enforce any rules people do what they want to. Point system sucks
bad,"I would never have any of my friend work there. I is not a good place to work at all a lot of the workers come fro waterloo and the r not very nice to you at all., and a lot a drugs."
bad,"Work was very stressful.Upper management was poor. "
bad,"a typical day at works starts off with coming in at 2:52 pm, gearing up, and stretching then you work extremely hard and fast paced for 2 hours. Then take a 15 break which includes 5 minutes of walking to the break room. then back to work for another 2 hours but this time a 30 minute break. After that break is over you work until the job is done which could be as late as 2 AM."
bad,Hated it every minute I had to be there. I was trained wrong then had my job threatened for doing it the was I was taught.  But only because the heat was coming down where it should have....on management.  They suck!
bad,its not to great I didn't like it mostly because I would have to drive an hour to get to work and the people aren't great some don't speak English and I don't like how this is required
bad,"You can't talk to anyone unless you understand multiple languages.  Bad supervisors, terrible hours, low pay, cut throat, liars,  the list could go on and on.  A man was actually stabbed and killed before I worked there and there were multiple fights and bad injuries when I worked there."
bad,id never recommend anyone to work here ever they over work you I worked 7 days a week over 12 hours a night. they do not care about your safety or well-being. I was harassed by the supervisor and they sexually harassed by a co worker they never did anything about it.
bad,Not a fair company at all!! My hours got cut but my co workers can get overtime!! Not fair at all. I do great work keeping the count on materials & scanning in everyone's work.
bad,The average work day is being constantly yelled at for production. The amount of work that comes is overwhelming. The company has no room for growth. The hours are not family friendly.
bad,"Very fast past job if you work in production and your fingers will start to lock up in 3weeks ,  if your not on light duty within the first 3 months and you make it past six then you may become a lifer their but it has one of the highest turn over rates."
bad,I got hurt on the job and had to sue their workmans compensation because medical at Tysons did not want to take care of me when I was injured on the job during work. I would not suggest this employer to any of my family or friends
bad,"It was hard work but that wasn't the problem, it was absolutely disgusting. Management was awful because they were all family so there was too much favoritism in the company."
bad,"I would not recommend working here. A white man has no chance. They are very discriminatory. I worked here a little over a week. I had a conflict with an employee on my line and instead of moving me, I was told there was nothing I could do. I was pushed around by some of the non-Caucasian employees on my line. When I reported it to my supervisor, nothing was done. They told me I was making 10.85/hour and when I received my first check, I was told I wasn't. They would also tell you that you would only be working to a certain time on Saturdays(say start at 4:30 and end at 8:30) but they change it as it gets closer to the time they said you would be off and you end up working the entire shift. The job itself was very easy, but I was not able to work in an environment where I was constantly pushed around by employees who were the same status as me. The benefits were great, but they also take more than you sign up for out of your check. I would not recommend this job to any Caucasian person."
bad,"When I first started there 23 1/2 years ago it was a great place to work... Since Tyson bought it out the place went down hill the plant closing is proof of that.  A typical day no one knows what is going on, the hardest part of my job going in every day. The most enjoyable part is going home.."
bad,At any given time the amount of work required is beyond human capability. They also pay according to the economy instead of the job. Workplace equality is also terrible.
bad,"This place was pretty bad and everything about it was bad. Magagement was terrible, breaks were short you had so much gear to take off and put back on and to be back at your work station was all included in your break time not to mention the decent walk you had to make to get from work station to break room as well. So a 15min break was more like 5mins god forbid you had to go number 2 while on your break you didnt have the time to even try to do so. The work load was always fast and pressing and never seem to let up at all. They were very demanding of their workers at all times. Their was never a set time for getting off as long as their was still chicken you didnt get to go home no matter the time. Working Saturdays was almost always required i barly saw two days off a week nor did i get to even see my house much either because of the fact we didnt have a set time we got off work"
bad,"The management style at Tyson Food is bulky, out of date and not effective in today's global economy. There are  many levels of communication (7 from the floor to Plant Manager) to become an effective in TPS or 6 sigma methods."
bad,This job was very demanding. It was a very fast working job. Management was not very supportive. Some of my co-workers worked as hard as me. The hardest part of the job was getting understanding from management. The most enjoyable part was being able to move around.
bad,"Thought it was a good place to work for the first 3 weeks, and during the 3rd week got laid off, management wasn't very helpfull during the process. Almost got into fight with guy that was training me cause he thought I should be going as fast as him in my first week (he's been doing that job for 8 years.) Contacted human resources about it they pretty much told me deal with it or there's the door. Will NEVER work there again, would not want my worst enemy to work there."
bad,"Working a line at Council Bluffs Tyson is terrible unless you love working every day.  You are expected to work 6-7 days a week, every week, every year.  Pray for a major holiday, because that will be your one day off for a month or maybe two.  The benefits were pretty good, but there was no work-life balance, unless your life is work.  You can be trained in a day, so you are replaceable easily.  Don't bother complaining because almost everyone is equally working that hard, including management.  Most of the management are good, but it seems beyond them to try to change the pace.  Unless you are truly desperate, don't work there. I doubt they have changed any.  It's the culture."
bad,"Long hours, was not appreciated, treated unfairly.  Supervisors were rude, unproffesional, and if they did not like you they would find a way to get rid of you."
bad,"a typical day at tyson is hard. but i have great co- workers we all work together,to get through the day."
bad,Management is oblivious to what is going on in the plant. Inconsistent and dishonest. Rules are altered at the managers discretion. Nothing is clearly outlined like schedule or job description.
bad,"Everyone in management is two-faced. They pass there work down to everyone below them and nothing gets done. They demand allot and dont deliver when you need help. They allow certain people to do as little as possible while others are held accountable. Accountability is a joke, as well as experienced leadership. Ego's are extremely high here, inexperienced people in high profile positions. incompetence"
bad,This is a job for people that aren’t eager to advance or wanting to learn more. They tell you things just to pacify you. Management has their picks. So it’s a good job for some and He’ll for other’s. I know I’ve tired it twice with the same out come for the last two times.
bad,"No diversity what so ever, management is horrible says things like “get your meat” belittling your pride of getting your job done with confidence because good was never good enough, the machines cause a lot of downtime by the way they are running the meat , if you don’t come kissing up to management they’re going to get rid of you 96% of the population is black ,  a very ghetto place to work, work life balance is a understatement you work every Saturday for months at a time just like a regular schedule.I would never go back to Tyson."
bad,"This was the dirtiest place I have ever worked in. Several health and USDA violations. People spitting in floor drains, s8nks, garbage cans. Employees did NOT wash their hands after using the bathroom. Place stunk before you even got in the parking lot and also inside as well. Floor drains had a rotten smell coming out. Cafeteria was sickeningly filthy."
bad,"They act as if we are family. Dispatchers are good but they have no power to help you but can get you fired fast. If your resetting, home time or on the yard putting your truck together to go on the road don’t fall out of your truck if you don’t have a run .Or twist your foot in the yard if you have no load yet. Because the minute you get hurt or FAMILY will mess over you on treating or workman’s comp"
bad,Management and HR does not care about they employees it’s always they word over ours. They treat they employees like kids and high school. They half train u then wanna penalize you for not following up to they standards. They pick n choose who they write up; they write employees up over the little things. If u not kissing up to them then u are a target. Supervisors be on the floor talking for hrs about nothing on the floor n if a production worker talk for 5 mins they quick to write u up but it makes it right for them to do it. I get supervisors go around n talk to employees but half the the time it don’t be job related. But it makes it right for them to get a pass all because they have an title of supervising.  just because u have an higher position doesn’t make it right for y’all to treat us anyway. I’m an adult not a kid. Management always assume what they want to assume and believe. They don’t investigate accordingly. They terminated me for asking another employee for help and didn’t care about my side of the story nor they asked the other employees that was present at the time. I wouldn’t recommend working here cuz the supervisors will lie on u to cover them n because they buddies with management they target u out.
bad,"Tyson doesn't care about anybody they only care getting the product out. The management is horrible, the supervisors show favatism. They want u to work hard but they don't wanna pay u good. If you been there 10 years or more you would be making the same thing as everybody else is making unless u are on the conelines. The new hire can coming in making the pay as the people that been there for years."
bad,"You are placed in a position where you are expected to work harder than your coworkers. Management is unfair, and you see a lot of favoritism, jobs that are suppose to be bid jobs they give to whomever they want."
bad,Dont work there unless you dont want a life your just a warm body to them they dont care about you they need people so bad they pretty much wont fire you period
bad,Working at Tyson was a very good experience but after a while I got to see how the really run unprofessional I feel they can do better with management and the way they talk and handle their employees
bad,Very stressful environment with no sense of direction. The plant in wilkesboro is terrible who treat people like military soldiers going to war. Very fast with one 45 minute break. On the last day of work you don't know what time you are getting off. They produce more chicken than they can handle which puts the supervisors in a bad position every week
bad,It was an ok job. I would not further my career with company due to a lot people had seniority and a little difficult to gain any experience with no experience in background.
bad,"you work in the cold,, work every Saturday,, Management does not care if you or family members are sick.. just as long as they have an able body there working. you work very hard... Tyson should start out paying 14.00 an hour, for the type of work that you do for the company. maybe people would stay. very high turnover rate.."
bad,Suck.But pays good. If they don't like you. They will find a way to get you out the door. HR is sick. They talk to you crazy and do whatever they feel like doing
bad,"Some workers worked very hard, some others did not so therefore the ones that cared about there job had to pick up others slack. Management not all but most pay no attention to whom was doing there job correctly or doing it at all. They would always wait till last minute to clean up before corperate people showed up. Tyson foods inc in monroe nc really need a whole new management team. There are thousands of other workers who would say the same but they will not come forward because of being scared they will lose their jobs. The facility is extremely dirty in places people dont look. Very very very last minute clean up to cover up all the damange that goes on everyday there. Wouldn't request tyson to anyone looking for a long term job."
bad,It was very good but it pay low and my back hurts the salary is not enough for my bills and to feed my family I stopped working because of the salary and sometimes my hip hurts
bad,no good really no good really stay away if you can they need management  they dont have thing together....... they r a mess really big time mess stay away
bad,You are thrown into positions with little training and expectations are to perform at a level that others that have been doing it longer are at. Also expected to do work like that every day all day with no exceptions I understand that is what you are paid for but at level above what should be expected in the first place is impossible to achieve everyday. The maintenance department I was in the low men were expected to do far more than ones that had been there longer once again I understand seniority has a factor but it also means better pay so you should have to pull your weight.
bad,"This job is very stress full ,tiring,long hours.speed is a huge factor with this company. I learned how to cut up a whole chicken. Mangement is terrible."
bad,"If you've been working there for decades under a supervisor that's been working there for decades you'll have a great experience getting to do whatever you want whenever you want in this plant. Otherwise you'll have to settle for crumbs. You can forget having any time for family or any social activities because they'll work you 6 and 7 days a week every week. Horrible place to work. Tyson Foods is a great company, it's this particular plant that is corrupt."
bad,"Employees aren't a big concern, the company is the main goal, the workers are an expendable asset available. A lot of drama from management, inconsistencies, and broken promises."
bad,Terrible place to work. Hourly employees are treated like worker ants.  Salaried personnel must work extremely long hours and the atmosphere is cut-throat.
bad,not a good company to work for....there is no communicate between management and employees..they reap all the bonuses while the employees do all the work
bad,the job its self is not hard but it does seem like work life balance is a problem I have kids that I don't get to see.  other than that its a great place to work they take care of their employees
bad,Do not work for this Department. They offer little to no training and the Manager and Supervisor will not interact or assist you. There is no consistency in management and favoritism plays a big role in this Department.
bad,"all they do is yell and make you feel bad about your overall performance no matter how hard you try. Their managers are mostly a joke and a lot of the supervisors are horrible people, its too bad, when it was Doskicil, it was a fun place to work."
bad,I learned a lot about the way the products are made manufactured and shipped .I learned the process of cleaning the machines and how everybody works together.
bad,"The managers are have a circle of friends and if you not in that circle you are nothing. The HR manager are not for the team members and policy, she does what her friends of management tell her to do."
bad,They are not understanding about home life at all. Life happens and they don't care about you or your life just want to work you too the bone with no appreciation
bad,Work 6 days a week. No life. Great benefits. Mentally very challenging. As long as you are a yes person you will not progress. You give all you got and it isn't enough. Would not recommend unless you want no life
bad,"Very stressful, arrogant, demanding management, that treats drivers like little kids.  Always on the drivers over the nanny cams.  They are continually looking for ways to take your hard earned bonus from you.  Equipment is worn out, and they refuse to replace it"
bad,Shifts are long and you're only allowed one thirty minute break. You never know what time you're getting off or if you have to work on your day off until the last minute. The job is very strenuous and causes health issues.
bad,"Managers are hard to work for.  Have a discipline stick it seems."
bad,Would not go back there good benefits work is very physical and fast pace they do not appreciate there employees the pay is not all that great after they take out for a union that doesnt support you
bad,bad management  who don't care about the employee they do not pay right thy have a picky pay scale and its all about who they like if they like you they keep you if not out the door you go.
bad,"When Tyson bought out Hillshire in Zeeland the culture changed, management became aggressive and harrassing, the employees became numbers, HR was not interested in the employees concerns, lots of coworker harrassment that was not addressed, reprecussions for reporting harrassment, I loved working for Hillshire, not at all for Tyson. Thru the company buyout all the good employees were seen as threats to the management so they all got pushed out the door which is when I left. Turnover rate is over 50% so you can imagine the constant training of people who wont be there come 2 weeks. 7 days a week 24hr 365 day operation. And if they say little overtime, just sign your life away cause its daily overtime plus saturday and sundays."
bad,"The job was fine as long as you were in shape. If you weren't, people fainted. Management could have been a lot better. My job was to beat on rail cars with a sledgehammer for anywhere to 30 minutes to 8 hours straight. The people here were extremely rude and treated other unfairly. No teamwork at all."
bad,"doesn't care about your life outside of the work place"
bad,"If your a union lover then this is the place for you, plenty of places to hide and go have a smoke, no one helps each other, and a majority of the people there show up drunk."
bad,I acquired this job due to that I got laid off every winter at a landscaping company. this job was three 12 hour shifts from 6 am to 6 p.m. Thursday through Saturday. it consisted of working in 28 degree temps in a giant freezer warehouse with five stories of bins containing various cow parts. I spent some days in an office coordinating everybody on the dock and other days on the dock building pallets or manifesting loads to be shipped out. I quit this position when I was promoted at my other job to a full time yearly position with a significant raise.
bad,"Horrible , and fellow employees loved talking more than doing there job!!"
bad,It's a slaughterhouse. Very hard work with high risk of injury. My job was to remove the hide from the side of a cow.
bad,"Don't be fooled by the other reviews. Since the company has downsized 3 -4 times in 3 years and now called Hillshire Brands, the company has gone completely down hill. Nobody is happy there and the morale is extremely low.  They keep letting people go, others are leaving so the workload is very high.  They are now based in Chicago which was a big mistake.  If you are considering appling for a  job with HB, please give it serious thought since the situation at this company is NOT improving."
bad,"Uma empresa de Alimentos,e foi prazeroso trabalhar la de temporario."
bad,"cutting meat pulling pushing, not friendly employees. the management not good. there is no enjoyable for this company."
bad,"It pays the bills my supervisor is very supportive. Other than that the job is just that it has no family value, they want u to drop everything and be there NO MATTER WHAT and it's sad"
bad,"This place has no diversity, all I witnessed while working there was the most ghetto, ratchet people ever, no home training for some, Human Resource was nice and professional. Pay is not spectacular only 11.30 per hour, long hours,you work hard for your money."
bad,Too many chiefs not enough Indians. Will hire anyone regardless of experience or good work practices. Maintenance and production are constantly pointing fingers as to why goal aren’t being made.
bad,I have a work injury but the adjuster decided it’s not so cause they can’t compensate my restrictions I’ve been forced on medical leave with out pay for two weeks which screws me over for bills
bad,Always changing what time we work and what jobs we are doing.  Big lack of management skill and professionalism. The other workers are good to be around but are under appreciated.
bad,"Worked for Tyson Hog farms for 4 months as a maintenance tech. We have all seen the videos on how Tyson treats their animals. It is true. They live in cramped, dirty barns for their entire life. I have witnessed on more than one occasion of animal neglect and abuse. The farm hands and managers care nothing of the welfare of those animals. "
bad,"The only good thing I can say about this job is it offers really good benefits. It's easy to get hired on meaning no background checks. You have absolutely no life working here, work almost every weekend on top if being worked like a modern day slave, the supervisors treat their employees poorly unless you're an butt kisser.  All this plant care about is getting that over pumped with steroids chicken out of the door. If you're on drugs this would be a place for you plenty of drugs in this place and easy to get."
bad,The company is ran by imcopete  idiots that will spend twice the amount to rig something then fix it right then  the upper management is a joke the stand there and watch you work then help you work but my supervisor is was good guy
bad,I enjoyed the time I spent with Tyson but put a lot of Ware and tare on my car and they don't follow through on alot of things  I was told when I first got hired alot of people say it's modern day slavery
bad,Overworked and unappreciated. Tyson claims to be very family orientated and caring of their employees. They say they are understanding and will work with you as long as you are willing however this is not true. They claimed to have switched to working five days a week so that the employees don’t have to work so hard to meet deadlines however employees on evening shifts are still working 10-12 hours a day.
bad,"I work as a quality monitor at a plant that was recently bought out by Tyson. We had to change all our policies over and the way Tyson does things seems to be very backwards from the way we were doing them before. Our ours were cut for months, we aren't allowed any overtime, our benefits aren't great, you are treated poorly by management, there isn't much job security and you can't move up unless somebody dies or your willing to relocate to a slaughterhouse or the middle of nowhere. If you're willing to settle for it, it's not that bad, I'm just not about that life."
bad,Ok until you get hurt. They exploit laws to protect the company in case employees get injured. They really have a habit to make the minor employees feel expendable. If you need a job it’s a great place to work and make money until you get hurt. My advice to anyone is to try for something in management up front.
bad,"When i first started Tyson foods i used to say that if i won the lottery i would continue to resume working there.Not so much anymore.I am very thankful to have a job at this time but its time for to me to move on.I want to be more than just a warm body in my position at work.Since March we have been only working 4 days a week.Management never had one meeting with their team members explaining why.We found out by word of mouth.We are the lowest paid factory in Sedalia! There is discrimination, favoritism and just too much drama in this plant.I've been employed at this plant for almost 8 yrs and it has gotten worse.Nothing is going to change .So its time for me to move on and do what i have to do for me.I want to be happy with my work place.Respect costs nothing."
bad,"I worked 2nd shift at Tyson,and I really didn't like that shift. Didn't like the fact we started at 5:15 and don't get off til 3:30 or 4 in the morning."
bad,"Cold standing in one place for 4 hours then lunch break lunch isn't free terrible people to work around managers are poor, your bathroom break is chosen for you and you do not get to choose when you have to go when you really need to go to the bathroom. This is the only job that has really hired me with my misdemeanor background and I really wanna do something more in my life than to have to work myself to death in an environment that is unhealthy makes me sick of the smell and look at raw chicken."
bad,This job is not for everyone.  I have many stories to tell about this company since my husband and I both worked here but I will just give you a recap of my time.  I worked in pork pack during the time that the lawsuit was filed when they required us to come fully equipped with all the safety they demanded and it did take a long time to do all those procedures but I have been compensated for time lost. Supervisors and leads at this plant are a straight up nightmare they play many games among everyone and among each other what I mean is alot of back stabbing name calling false statements things that are setting the company up for lawsuits and this is why they have so many.  This is the most diverse job I have ever worked at and it was not for me I believe everyone has the right to work but some of the people that work their have different cultures and views and are really rude and sexist I had a couple fights with men who made it very clear that I was wrong just because I was a woman.  Arabics get special religious accomadations so they pray all the time in the hallways and have some bathroom practices that are gross and I think this way about it because they dont wash their hands after they clean their privates in the bathroom.  This is like any other job if you work hard you get more work than others ALL the time and are constantly picking up the slack for people who will file lawsuits for discrimination if the leads tell them to do their job so at Tyson that means if you want to be lazy you can because no one will say a word. I really dont have many nice things to say about
bad,"I didn't have a problem with production work, but the training sucks- you have to learn from sign language because no one speaks the same language, not even the trainers, and the floors aren't cleaned like they should be. My husband was a clod puller and ended up falling in the line and almost having half a cow fall on top of him due to people not doing their job."
bad,It would seem employees are are underpaid as well as environmental conditions of parts of the plant are not the most employee friendly.
bad,"A typical day at work consist of being on the floor 5 minutes before your work time. I was required to wear beard guard, hair net, ear plugs, apron, cotton and plastic gloves and slip resistance shoes/boots. My position was based on rehanging dead chickens on an assembly line for cut up process. My co-workers, well i did not stay at the job long enough to actually know how they were. The hardest part about the job was trying to deal with sharp pain in my hands, wrists, and arms while trying to to perform the essential task and duties."
bad,I hated every minute working for this company. They would pile on more and more work while giving us less time to do it. Internal promotions were almost non existent. Management's philosophy was to say one thing and do something different.
bad,This job was easy and high performance. The hardest part of the job was getting trained properly because management was not willing to cooperate in a professional fashion. The enjoyable part of this job was the incentive that was offered to the grave yard crew.
bad,"Very abusive place. Concentration camp culture. If you are not in the ""Buddy"" list they will try to work you to death and blame you for the mistakes made by other employees."
bad,The Upper Management of the HR Department acts as if she is higher class than everyone else!!!  I wouldnt recomend this job to anyone... This position never stays filled very long.
bad,tyson foods is a very cold invionment. has gret benefits and is a equal opportuinty employer.
bad,"a fast place company, that i feel like... one had NO out side life but Tyson! management only cares only for one shift ( 1st ) NO team work from some co-workers. the hardest part of the job, is looking for orders when they are palled up on top of each other when one has a load that has to be out in like an hour or so ( to me that causes stress ) and now you have to explain why your load is late going out! all an all it pays the bills, but i am looking for a job that management looks at there works for what they do for the company. not ways to make them feel as there job is not good enough!"
bad,"Ok crowd of co workers. Ok bosses, some people work together, some don't.i really don't have much to say, work long hours for not enough pay. Men get paid more then women."
bad,"Back dock live receiving and live hanging is a dirty and physically painful job.  Very physically demanding and excessive repetition with heavy lifting and bad ergonomics leads to recurring injuries which make it increasingly difficult and unhealthy to do your job."
bad,smell like pig blood all the time. etc. complete racial profiling only really care about you if your a minority or nonwhite. dont get paid as much when 90 days kicks in. half your check is gone.
bad,"I still work here...Tyson bought out the company I was originally working for...I've been here since 2015.. Tyson pretty much robbed people here of money..they took over..then robbed some people of their yearly raise..I was one..then invested $20 million dollars to ""renovate"" my plant..put us off work for two weeks UNPAID and told us to use all our vacation if we wanted a paycheck. Since we have came back..the plant bass been even worse than before..now there is little communication on the production floor.. A lot of seasoned people are quitting..this is NOT good for long term"
bad,There are two coworkers there who will not and cannot get along with other coworkers. They’ve been allowed to act this way for years. Nothing ever happens to them for their bad behavior. One of them is protected because their brother-in-law is higher in management. Awful place to work for teamwork. Because there is no teamwork. They are always trying to get everyone else in trouble.
bad,"I was hired by the company but no relevant info about the start date and orientation was relayed to me. They never called me to tell me exactly when to show up and who to contact upon arrival. On my scheduled start date, I realized I didn't know who to see or when to be there, so I finally checked my email and discovered that they had emailed me 5 days prior, instructing me to be there at 8:00 am. I responded and informed them that I had missed the scheduled orientation time that I wasn't aware of prior to reading this email and received a cryptic reply that I would be called the following day.  They never called me, and after I called them requesting some information and clarification, they STILL did not return my phone calls. A week after missing orientation I just happened to check my email, once again and discovered that they had emailed me the previous day informing me that I was to be there that morning at 8:00 am. Once again I had missed the orientation, and after emailing them to report the problem, they told me that I needed to reapply.  I wrote her back and told her that a simple courteous phone call would have averted all of that confusion and miscommunication from the start.  I have never experienced anything like that, ever!!"
bad,"No chance for advancement. Very low pay, bad enough to be on food stamps. No overtime allowed. THEY WILL NOT HIRE WITHIN THE COMPANY, I HAVE TRIED 7 TIMES!"
bad,The Jobs was okay it’s Just I didn’t like Way they had me working. I didn’t the Way They was treating me and sometimes they are rude and don’t know how Talk Too people.
bad,"A typical day at Tyson Foods was fun. I got along with the people and the environment was ok. "
bad,It’s and ok job just have to work every Saturday you never be off but one day and that’s Sunday the pay is not that good but I enjoy working with people
bad,The supervisors and gpm all treat you like a door mat unless you have brown skin. They mess up on payroll all the time. You get yelled at all the time even if it's not you fult.
bad,Lots of favoritism and backstabbing in the company. Rules applies to some and not to others. My coworkers were nice and helpful. Is a revolving door 10 are hired and 20 leave.
bad,"Be on your guard, very cutthroat.  Management, if they liked you, you were ok, but if they didn't you were in trouble, in jeopardy of loosing your job."
bad,That do not treat Arabic people good only white people and Spanish  the work was hard and the bosses are racists if  white or spanish you OK and thy don't like black to but they can not thread them bad
bad,"Worked for them for 10 years. Worked in every department and became a lead.  Never appreciated, expected you to lie to make product pass specs. If you stopped a line due to quality issues you were reprimanded. Worked 6-7 days a week. Management has no clue as to what they are doing. Only care about quantity not quality. Expect you to follow their ethics policy, yet there is a gpm having an affair with team member which is supposed to be against their ethic code. All depends on who you know.  Never a bonus or anything at Christmas. No employee appreciation at all."
bad,"bad expeience no good hard work little pay, bad bad"
bad,When working here this place sucks. They never really have much work and they dont like for you to get hours. Very stingy company. I will never go back
bad,Currently have over 9+ company job listings open for a reason.  Oldest and last union plant of Hillshire Brands - at high risk of closing down.  Mass exodus of all management for a reason.  Recordable and first aid injuries are extremely high.  Enjoyed eating the free samples in quality assurance.
bad,"Llego a la empresa, saludos a todos los compañeros. Paso a la sala del cuarto frió para ver que todo este en orden. realizo mi muestreo de pesaje y sacar el huevo no incubable, los clasifico en conos y registro esos datos en mis formatos."
bad,They make you work holidays and Monday through Saturday all year long.  They love to over work and under pay you.  They have great insurance but you as worker don't get treated all that good by management.
bad,"Tyson has a lot to offer in getting you prepared for a career in industrial maintenance."
bad,It seems like upper management knows what is wrong but refuses to fix issues.  They don't listen to team members even though they have meetings for advice.
bad,No advancement. The pay is very bad . HR people are rude to my wife and myself. There is no way for anyone to contact me in case of an emergency. Dangerous people who are terrible drivers.
bad,"Tyson is a job where you can climb the the ladder being dedicated only to Tyson.  Your on your 8-12 hours a day.  They have a cafeteria where you can eat, are you can go to the only 3 places to eat."
bad,"Normal working schedule is 8 hours and regular overtime. If overtime is scheduled it will be scheduled by working 10 hour days Tuesday through Friday with the potential of working 6-8 hour Saturdays. Can only work 3 Saturdays in a row during winter and 2 during the summer."
bad,The Supervisor and General Production Manager i worked with were great.The long hours and seven days a week were not so great. the long drive was very tried some after working 12 to 16 hours.
bad,Some of the the people are ok. Needs to have more breaks because it's hard on your hands and arms to constantly work with them 3 full hours. Needs more relief
bad,A typical day at work is easy as pie it's very paid back I love washing the vats I make 12.25 an hour but the work only last for bout 7 hours there is no hard part about the job management don't bother u its a pretty decent work place just the hours and pay isn't worth staying
bad,Go in process chicken. It’s cold where you work. The most enjoyable it.s a good working environment. I learned how important it is to make sure the machines are clean when processing food products.
bad,"our supervisors-try hard 2nd shift,day shift supervisors?? I think there asleep more than supervise (chair-cushions) nap-time.a person can learn a lot of jobs if you want too learn!! We have a lot of people who should retire along time ago-slow moving..and won't retire. Our human resource people-act like (not my problem,go too work) snarling-and the stink-eye look.we have a lot of temp/perm lay-offs."
bad,It was a job for a person that just moved to a new location. Was a filler position.
bad,The Hr manager does not take action when complaints are told to him he only protects the managers. When the supervisor and employee get into conflicts the supervisor is always protected why the employee is either in trouble or protected
bad,"A lot of discrimination goes on at Tyson Foods. Everyone is not provided the same equal opportunity when it comes to training and HR can’t assist with applying for management positions, can’t assist with worker’s comp claims and HR will make up a job title just to justify giving that person extra pay."
bad,Tyson foods was a good job it has its good stuff it's drawbacks overall a good place to be environment was good just didn't like the bosses very much at all
bad,Some of the Supervisors act like they don't know how to show respect but act like hoes when You put them in place anyway I feel that they need to show Respect and You will be respected
bad,I think this was a nice experience for me to have a chance to work in a environment with that type of operations going on. Had the chance to work in positions i never done or seen.
bad,But the chickens are treated better than humans. Each employee that smoke pay 10.00 weekly to smoke but can't smoke at Tyson unless your off the clock. Me personally don't smoke but it only takes 3 minutes tops for a smoke break. Managers need to stop having personal relationships with team members.
bad,Management makes it very difficult to hold team members accountable.  These actions often lead to working extended shifts which may also include weekend work.
bad,The Haltom City plant in Texas is probably the worst place to work. People are rude and supervisors don’t communicate well with their employers. Drama all around the entire plant.
bad,"Management does not act like management.  They are immature and love feeding into ""drama"" which HR tells everyone what you tell her( which is suppose to be private). They don't like lesbians but they love Hispanics!!"
bad,"This job is more for people who need a stepping stone after jail/prison or who don't want to pursue a career path. The job is simple, not challenging."
bad,"I may not be the best judge of Tyson since we went on strike shortly after they bought the meat packing plant.  I believe the only reason they kept us was a flood that happened in 2008 so they had to continue business for 7 years.  They did everything they could to undermine what we tried to do.  High Wisconsin taxes was not in their agenda, profits were all that mattered.  They ruined moral by doing this to people who dedicated decades of their lives to this plant and it's people.  Whether corporate Tyson learned anything from this...I don't know.  But they ruined a productive, money making plant in record time.  People stopped caring when management stopped treating us like people and chose to treat us like minions.  We always understood the need for profit, and until Tyson forced us to walk, this plant was highly profitable.  Millions per year...not enough for them."
bad,"Would be a great job for someone who had absolutely nothing else to do. Supervisors tell me how to do a job I've done for over a year when they haven't been in the department for a month. I give my 200% all day while half my teammates screw around. Never heard a ""thank you"" since the new supervisor came over 3 months ago. Superintendent hasn't talked to me in 2 months and has yet to say anything nice. Basically like working in a prison surrounded by people who make you uncomfortable. It's like all they want are the extroverts and the introverts are bullied around. If employees were appreciated, there would be a huge morale boost."
bad,"Team members you are pretty good taken care of. no issue there, paid VAC 14 days of missed with 28 day roller over, 3 floating holidays as well, paid weekly, pay from 11 something to 15 dollars an hour. plus over time every week. "
bad,"I try to work hard and be responsible for my work. And I'm interested in social work, I like to share good ideas with others. And I like to take something new in developing countries"
bad,"The pay is great. That being said you work 6 to 7 days a week. You don't get any PTO unless you've been there for a year then you get 5 vacation days. They're more partial towards other races than they are the white people that work there which makes it incredibly difficult when you have an issue. You don't get proper training but if you're a hard worker and you pick up things quick you will do fine. The insurance benefits are good and are not that costly. Just like every other company they just want to make money. When it comes to the needs of their employees whether it's tools, training or time off for their families needs they are not the best company to work for."
bad,I would not recommend anyone to go though Kelly Service cause they got alot of problems within there services. My experience with them was not every good
bad,"Working there I learned that people can be rather lazy, rude, aggressive, and just flat out lazy and don't get me wrong I worked as hard as I could with little training and lazy co workers who just stood there and complained while taking too many breaks or quitting so my area was always short staffed either way I never really saw my supervisor anywhere when he was needed and not only that the first shift supervisor was always cursing at us telling us we where f ups and lazy, worthless, and dumb but other than that some people like it some don't you gotta be aggressive and tough too work there."
bad,"Tyson is a great company unfortunately maintenance management is very poor. Work culture is bad, no team work, no organization, favorites among supervisors and associates. lazy associates are not held accountable. The hardest part of the job is working at Tyson, complaints are not held in a confidential manner, they are not resolved."
bad,"Not That I'm Mad I Got Fired , I Just Feel The Way The Situation Was Handled Wasn't Right , Very Messy Place & Need Random Drug Screening If You Ask Me ."
bad,hang chicken and trimming them hardest thing about it is make sure you don't hang one legs the hardest part about trimming make you don't cut the wrong part
bad,they investigations sucked and they showed a lot of favortism instead of treating every employee the same
bad,"The supervisor here at tyson are going crazy.  I would not recommend working here.  Supervisor pick and choose who they want to pick on to the point of firing. People have complain to hr but they do not do anything about it because the supervisor are buddies with them. Someone got wrote up for being 6 seconds late for break.  6 SECONDD LATE! Anf he was already pass door. Which was also not said is when he walk thru the door , there were other people behind him or in front of but u don't see them being written up. The worker are alone in this work place.  I wouldn't trust any supervisor or hr employee."
bad,"Felt like I was a passenger in a very large vehicle and that the vehicle was out of control headed for disaster. There is actually just as many managers as working staff. The struggle for power is real and it’s like a blood bath daily to survive in the Tarboro Plant. HR will say and put in writing anything to hire qualified people. But after the hiring what’s agreed on is not reality due to the corporate structure. Someone in a different state can override any agreement made with the new employee and declare that the agreement was not in compliance with company guidelines. Basically, even if you get it in writing don’t expect Tyson to go through your hiring agreement. My immediate manager was awesome but didn’t have the power to do his job efficiently."
bad,I love the benefits but I don't like the management or my hours. I don't like the way they treat their employees and they only care about the work and not about the workers.
bad,A typical day at day at work would be standing in a cold work environment for long periods of time I learned that a poultry is not for me the management is poor the work place culture is a mixer the hardest part of the job was standing on the line debone chicken the most enjoyable part of the job was getting off work.
bad,no advancement or job security I worked at Tyson for 9 years no advancement no pay I had to leave that job for my good maintenance management bad stop my pay & advancement
bad,"A stressful job ,over worked , never have time for Family members , long nights , never know when we will get off  , unorganized business production always down . Good paying job"
bad,"A typical day at work: Never knowing when your shift ending"
bad,I work in the blast and I have worked there for five years and they can often be very unfair about things.The pay is not enough for things that you have to do and the hours you have to work. You do not get enough time off for the holidays.
bad,"Great job with good pay, loved my co-workers and leaders. Best job I have ever had, till they shut down the plant!"
bad,"A typical work day is cold and fast pace, standing all day for 9 to 10 hours a day. Always moving I learned how to be a team player, and be a back-up lead as well. Management is strict,co-works are a little over broad at times,and don't want to do their job,or slow. The hardest part about the job is pulling the meat in a straight line at a fast pace, and sometimes standing more than 9 hours. The most enjoyable part about Tyson is working with others,because there's never a dull momen."
bad,I worked with chicken breast all day ! Pulling them apart and breaking them up
bad,would not work there was unhappy every day. Safety came last and production was first. Work environment was hostile at times and Management only cared about their numbers.
bad,I had an issue with an employee and didnt not feel safe returning to work with the individual. I relayed my request to HR and they said they would handle it. I was going to return to work on monday but had a family emrgency at home and did not go only to have a phone call later from HR terminating me. They cant find good help because the wont get rid of their trash.
bad,"Not good training, supervisor hard too find, inadequate ppe, amonia leaks without any alarms going off is my main concern, what if that was too happen again an someone doesn't make it out"
bad,lack of knowledgeable supervisors and managers; no support from senior leaders; would not recommend this as a place to work for anyone; very toxic environment
bad,Don't work for this place they are racist and no place for advancement unless your family or close friend. Lack of management. Long hours with very few days off . Mandatory overtime .
bad,it is a stressful environment and if you like gossip and people always on your business then its the right place there is no ethic on the supervisors part and they pick favorites
bad,It all just SUCKED BAD NOTHING GOOD to say manegment sucked had there faveret drinking buds they all sucked the place was always dirty nasty I DINT EAT TYSON MEAT NO GOOD
bad,"There stacking 40 poind 2 boxs for 12 hour's terrible supervisors , cold rarely go home or know when u r going home co workers stand and walk around talking ...favortism among co workers ...no one's never around to help when stuff breaks down 15 min breaks suck as well..."
bad,"Great place to work and live in TC."
bad,I did not have a good experience working there it was either too cold or too hot and of all things like working on an assembly line going at fast pace.
bad,Not a good place at working management is Poor security is weak....I'll say I wouldn't work there.its a good job but very bad management i think they should shut it down
bad,"Tyson Foods has management.  There are so many great people that work for Tyson Foods and depending upon where you work, the culture is fantastic.  The hardest part of the job is the hardest part of the job."
bad,"Terrible environment, did it as a summer job. low pay, not very hard overall. Limited breaks, and lots of working overtime. Lots of down time where you would stand around for hours."
bad,To each his own but if you ask me its just a stepping stone to get you to your destination job management has a real good way of pointing out that there in charge dont care about you. Your expendable if your numbers arent to there standard or if they just dont like you as a worker or a person with that being said very fast paced. They say its all about speed i dont belive it there system is flawed .
bad,Very very productive and demanding its not a good company to work for they dont practice safety and management is terrible.they dont care about there workers
bad,Sat at my computer all day. Didn't engage employees that reported to me due to the lack of time in the day and that the biggest part of my job focused on inventory control
bad,From the day into the factory they tell you the job is something that's it isn't so when you finally get on the floor to start work your more discombobulated from everything and everyone around you.
bad,Tyson has many people there so working as a team is the most important thing at Tyson . Also if you don't like the position I have all you have to do is ask for another position
bad,If you love spending your weekends with the family dont apply here only get 1 Saturday off a month. The pay was good.  But the hours they make you work are horrible.
bad,Very hostile work environment! I was constantly being yelled at for others mistakes. Fellow employees were hostile as well. This caused a lack of productivity in the work place.
bad,"I really enjoyed working with the elderly and disable, being able to take care of them in their time of need taking to Doctor Appointments"
bad,Go to your work station assigned to you on production line wait for start up work begins.I have learned the does and don't management is great co-workers very out going  the hardest part of the job is staying awake in a wet place the most enjoyable when work is done clock out going  home.
bad,"To many policies To many hours attendance policy to limited"
bad,"I learned how to do great team work, and work on assembly line. I also got the chance to meet new co-workers. The hardest part of the job was using a knife. The most enjoyable part was learning how to do new things."
bad,fun place to work people are easy to get along with and the abilty to learn new mech
bad,"pressure wash and sanitize equipment for production. I didn't agree on amount of time to clean certain machines . management was one sided , if they didn't like you ,you usually got wrote up or stories made up .co-workers were great. being ready for preop. clocking out"
bad,in the beginning job was good. But became to stressful. It got to the point where I needed a change
bad,It was an experience working at Tyson chicken the pay was good and good hours the managers was okay when they want be the environment was cold but other that I like working at Tyson chicken
bad,hated working there so many drugs supervisors were disrespectful
bad,"made sure everything was cleaned according to the USDA regulations.CO-workers were okay, most of them didn't speak much English"
bad,Work there for a month and never got my checks.  Went to HR and they refused to help me.  These people are bad people to work for
bad,It was always busy and the product had to be productive and good quailty.
bad,"Hard work, good team ship. This company had pro leadership. Was more like working for a temp service instead of working at a job."
bad,It really wasnt that bad all I had to do was go to work but the people with power are no good they are very rude... my supervisor cussed me out one time but in all it was ok
bad,"Loved my job, great culture! There was a sense of accomplishment at the end of the day. Pay was great. Only regret is they shut us down. We all worked together! I worked at the start of the product, if the next guy needed something he’d come to me and tell me “I need more of this” or “less of this”"
bad,"...Really enjoyed working there, I was able to pro more fast in the company and I met a lot of different people that i enjoyed to work around. I would go back"
bad,nothing was learned.management of machinery is very good.co-workers were good as well.hardest part was having to work with few people available.the fun part was wokring on saturday's and getting breaks for an hour at times when machinery broke down.
bad,Really don't care for the supervisors...or people that work here. There is no room for growth or relocation. Freezing cold!
bad,The company needs to hire supervises that know what to do under pressure. And how to make quota without over working there employees.
bad,Worked on a line and trussed whole chickens. Which means putting rubber bands around the chicken wings and then pulling the legs into the rubber band. I learned how to work with alot of people at one time. The co-workers had alot of different type of backgrounds but I learned out to work with them. Hardest part of the job was not being appreciated. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting paid every thursday.
bad,"excellent company. excellent benefits good  working  environment"
bad,"My typical day at work was to maintain all equipment as they break down,learn how to repair them as needed and managed my fellow workers to make sure they did what was needed. The hardest part was modifying the equipment and the most enjoyable part of my job was seeing the equipment work right."
bad,"They hire anyone even people with fake social security cards, a lot of supervisor can't even speak English. Its so cold had pneumonia 3 times in 1 year would have to walk out of cold into sometimes 100 ℉ in goodlettsville,Tennessee"
bad,Tyson Foods is not a good place to work. I had very many issues with co-workers and bosses. They over worked everyone every night for hours on end. My shift was from 4:30 to 1:30. I never got off no earlier than 2:30. There was days we didn't get off until 4 or 5
bad,"They do not care about their employees, they expect the job to be their entire lives yet they are not willing to compensate their employees for the work that they do.  Management was always telling the employees different information so we never knew what to do or when.  If someone in a leadership role did not personally like someone they make it their goal to make that person's time at work as miserable as possible. There is no way to get raises or move up in the company.  There is no security at all.  Things get stolen and no one is accountable."
bad,If you like to work with all mexicans since the building was by the border then perfect job for you.  If you a white person then be prepared to speak espanol
bad,Working at Tyson foods was very stressful . I had no life outside of work. They do pay well but u go home hurting every day. And it's not a job for everyone
bad,"pick up all tool needed to start work apron,hair nets,rubber boots, then head to workstation pickup pallet jack, pallet, boxes,labels,bags,start packing boxes"
bad,"No me gusta por el frio y no te dan proteccion para ello, no son buenos ayudando, no son reciprocos, es un ambiente hostil y de mucho problema, no hay compañerismo"
bad,They don't fully investigate anything and the fired people over the phone and not I  person. They suspend you based on what team members tell you and they don't tell team members when they do things that could potentially be a health or a risk
bad,Dont want to work there agian but most enjoyable thing about tyson foods hours which include overtime. Management can be very rude and you will deal with that most of your experience with company Hr is in the same boat
bad,"Great training and schooling paid for by Tyson, ideal place to work for younger men looking to get career training and on the job training, nearly impossible to balance work, family or social life, ok salary, long hours and mandatory overtime"
bad,"It started off ok but since I've been there, I have worked every Saturday and some Sundays for a year and eight months. It's all work and no appreciation. I'm 45 years old and I hardly have any time to myself."
bad,If you enjoy being out all night straight shotting 650 mile loads for wee morning delivery sitting in docks 6 plus hours getting an argument when you ask for home time purposely dehydrating yourself so you won’t have to stop to go and be late and if you never like to sleep then this is the job for you!! It’s just not my cup of tea! Not so good equipment that shakes jerks lurches and they get mad when you tell them you need it fixed....dispatcher is kind of hateful ...dispatch rarely answers the dang phones!
bad,They over work their employees and have them do jobs that require compensation but the employees never get it. They also write you up when you forget your clock in badge.
bad,"The animal cruelty was sad. The amount of filth made food unsafe"
bad,Most of the people working there were Hispanic and not knowing Spanish it was hard to communicate with operators to find out the problem with the equipment to  be able to fix it
bad,"Worst management I've ever work for all they do is lie about everything no raises or compensation. You can't go to the restroom without a manager or supervisor looking at you like you've stolen something sad place to work,just a pay check which isn't worth the frustration you have to endure."
bad,"Working for 8 years and don't feel appreciated. And if you get hurt, they will try and make you feel like it's your fault. Perfect example: if your in a environment where the floor doesnt have something to provent you from slipping, they'll try to tell you how to not fall. Like really?."
bad,"I didn't like the job at all, worked long hours, received low pay, work environment is cold and wet, management was overbearing and could sometimes be oppressive. Just not the job for me, for some people who just cant find work its a job, but thats about it."
bad,"It sucked really bad , the people was always rude to me and when i asked a question they always had a smart remark. and they hit me with a box on accident but i think it was on purpose"
bad,By far the worst job I ever had.  Worked 7 days a week and almost every holiday.  They said they were a family oriented work place but never allowed you to spend time with yours.
bad,can't have a life outside of the plant because you work 12-14 hours a day and 7 days a week management doesn't care about employees safety and well being
bad,A normal day when i worked a Tyson was i would clock in as the sun was going down before the meeting of how much needs to be done  have all my  paper work ready  look to see how much day shift need to have reworked as well as if they needed help.During the day/night help fix any thing that may break down as well as keep track of how much was going on a pallet of what product  as well as how much each package wight  and if it was under or over  the weight it have to be redone as well as check the seal  on the chicken every  five to ten min to ensure the dry ice was not touching  the chicken . then i go enter  all my info in to the computer  how many pallets how much they weight was as well as the product numbers.example 902213 is garlic roasted chicken with herbs.
bad,"Wear proper attire, packaging inspection, weighing items."
bad,"management style was combative (the CEO is proud of that fact and stated it in the MBA Student video to draw interns).  Not a fun place to work, very negative environment."
bad,This was the worst work environment I have ever worked in; terrible values; sex on job; low pay
bad,standing and packing chickens.
bad,"Pick up dead in morning, walk them in evening and make sure the feed doesn't run out.  Then you raise them until they are 57 days old then sell, clean houses, setup houses then get baby chicks."
bad,It is not to bad but if you want to move up in the company you have to know some one and they do not help for family stuff so you have to take points for school functions and family matters. And if you have to go to the doctor they don't expect to help you and they will let you go over nothing if they get mad at you for standing up for yourself.
bad,"There is no advancement opportunities and machines don't even work half the time making job stressful, maintenance don't even care about fixing anything. They have unsanitary practices that could cause recalls in their products."
bad,"Gotta be in a clique to move up.  They stopped doing progressive raises.  In shipping dept 2nd shift are lazy.  They practice nepotism. If you wanna move up you have to be in a clique.  Ppl promote their family, if you work hard they don't recognize you. Shipping supervisors are good supervisors on paper, bad in reality.  Some 2nd shifters they are childhood friends with the supervisor so they sluff off and the supervisor looks the other way. No pay for performance.  Shipping is just absolutely ridiculous . If you try to say /stand up for something that's right you get labeled a troublemaker.  And they won't adcance you. "
bad,Working in this department is very demanding both of your time and your abilities. They do however provide online training to help you improve your skill level. As for the work itself all overtime is mandatory and 10 to 12 hour work shifts should be expected
bad,"70+ hours in a week and take home 640 lol no thanx. Tyson lies to all new hires with every aspect of the company. Pay is horrible and no cooperation from hr on any problems you might have. No one on my line in skinless packaging good communicate in english, making it almost impossible to work efficiently."
bad,I know that each plant is different. The one I worked at make bacon bits and tacos. I worked on the taco side and leadership was lacking. There was no accountability. If you had seniority then you didn't have hard at all.
bad,"I don’t like the fact that rules change so frequently!!"
bad,The managment don't really care about the employees they just care about the work getting done any way  possible .They make you do jobs that's not even your job title. They take their worker for granted.
bad,"Worked in Accounting dept. Created production reports and yields. Changed scales, rebox and helped other departments; i.e. purchasing, payroll and security.  Dealt with up to 14 managers daily and also helped Cost Accountant when necessary.  Learned all of this on the job and enjoyed the work but was grossly underpaid and overworked.  No chance for promotion as once you do well in a position you are there forever.  Management took me for granted and didn't even remember my birthday.  Very badly treated if you got sick or missed any time at all.  Lots and lots of gossip!  Terrible environment with lots of pieces of meat and blood on paperwork.  Filthy odors that management tried to cover up using sasafras and various strong smelling cleansers.  The odor was most likely coming from the pipes and probably never resolved.  The most enjoyable part of the job was staying busy.  The hardest part was dealing with mean co-workers, although the late shift workers were very kind.  The most insulting thing was that for Christmas they gave out coupons for free Tyson Chicken Nuggets.  Not quite the culture they promised; i.e. 'family oriented'....a joke."
bad,"My employer was located in a right to work state and Tyson Foods applies great pressure to maintain a nonunion environment.  Management and human resources operates under the most convenient manner for them.  They will completely disregard company policy and pay scales when it suites their agenda."
bad,Tyson Foods in Concordia has a management staff that is not able to take care of their hourly team members. As a Supervisor I was required to work my team for 5 weeks 7 days a week even after asking for assistance with the scheduling. I was told at one point during a Supervisor’s meeting that “I just needed to show up and do my job.”
bad,"Not a good place to work. It is a fast pace work environment but the management only thinks of the numbers and not the employees         "
bad,"fast paced, stress full because of poor management/ team leads, you're voice or opinion is over looked in team or group setting/ meetings etc........."
bad,"Day to day consisted of preventive maintenance on machines that were not priorities to the facilities process(es), making machines run, starting various projects simultaneously, and work orders plus the calls process supervisors make. Learned to use documentation, and camera awareness to better my well being in the job. Facilitated tactics were hard to overcome. The best part of the job is end of shift."
bad,Poor management  the work place isn’t getting better it’s getting worse. The supervisors shows favoritism and lack of communication with some of their employees and the Human Resource sucks!
bad,"Tyson needs to come in and clean house with their management there, the team members and management who have been there since the company was Sara Lee are very favored and do not treat all team members the same. "
bad,it was a very high strung job with no way to advance unless you kiss the bosses butt. management was poor. with no work ethics. the turn over here was very high.
bad,I work at Tyson foods in Monroe nc I’m not saying all Tyson foods r like that but this plant is not managed in the right way no control team members control the plant like look at all the things tht go on at this plant look at the turn overs just look at the parking lot n it’s policy that they don’t abide by dress code man and woman cell phones that goes for supervision n management it’s just a lot of cooperate came unannounced they would see how Tyson foods in Monroe nc just want the birds out the door n can careless how they get them out.
bad,Job itself wasn't bad it's all about percentage not the worker. You get sick or hurt or family emergency they don't care give points anyway even with doctor's note management promote who they want despite weather they are qualified or not . The only way to get ahead in this company is to suck up. Long hours  they say volunteer overtime but it's not managers force you to sign up even if your mandated to work . They threaten you with write up if you refuse to sign up. Good job if you don't have a family or life .
bad,"Great place to work if your going to college or temporarily need a job but for the extensive amount of work you do and horrible temperatures its not worth the pay. "
bad,Just a very horrible place to be. Not one shred of human compassion or even decency among any of the employees or management. Long hours with short breaks. on your feet standing one place the whole shift. Very repetitive work.
bad,Starts out not bad but quickly goes to 6+ days a week managers can easily harass team members about personal business and personal business is spread easily by management
bad,"Safely and proficiently operated forklifts for transportation of materials between loading, processing, and storage areas in a timely manner."
bad,"I was a wing cutter on the cone line, I would be the first person to arrive on my job early. I was never late."
bad,It's the worst company to work for especially Houston plant on port wall street they say there a family orientated environment but management and the way they schedule things are horrible no sense of direction human resources are a joke plant manager might as well  corporate need to come in themselves to see what there doing there's no nurse on staff on third shift so if you have an emergency pray to God u make it don't recommend anyone working in the Houston plant my advise run somewhere else!!!!!!
bad,"Gave  me the work hours i was promised, but a lot of people would just stand around and talk with the leads and supervisors while the rest of us would work. A lot of drama at this plant, a lot of felons work here,a lot of tension."
bad,after missing due to a colon infection the wouldn't excuse my missed days even after having notes from doctor to excuse me. mispaid me for the fist two months and I never have felt to secure in the job. plus since working at this pant I have been sick more than ever due to being in the slauter evisuration area
bad,"Regular work place. I needed to work after my brother had died. It was cold and wet.  They had great lunch, My supervisor was great."
bad,"dia tipico de trabajo, llegar resibir turno de los compañeros que salen , incidencias del dia, pendientes etc, de mis compañeros un buen ambiente de trabajo, la perte mas dificil es trabajar sin las refacciones minimas nesesarias para desenpeñar las labores,"
bad,The St.Joseph Missouri plant the management is horrible.My idea would be fire everyone.The training for new employees is very poor.I would not recommend this job to my worst enemy.
bad,"Relatively good workplace but large plant and unfriendly co-workers. The worst things i hated were the smocks, hair nets, and hard hats. But over all it was ok."
bad,"Your co workers are the only people you can relate to management and HR don’t really care about your needs they just want the work done without doing work themselves. The work is very fast paced with no appreciation,benefits are not good with the pay you make cause you have to pay for insurance and still have a co pay"
bad,There ok management is awful they don’t really care about u or your opinions. They pay ok but they don’t care about anything about u. People work there years but not just because it was Tyson it was other companies before that.
bad,Tyson has changed and is no longer the company I went to work for almost 26 years ago.  They are no longer family oriented but are corporate oriented. They cared more about whether or not I brought “energy” to my interview when they decided to make ya all reapply for our jobs then the fact that I knew my jobs inside and out and my customers loved me.  I do not know how I could have brought more energy because I loved my job and the people I worked with
bad,"Everyone is drama filled from the management to the crew members, favoritism, lack of work ethics, no help from other team members, little to no breaks, your shifts are long and brutal, it's always bout getting production in and out, it's never about the workers who actually make that happen. They go by a point system by how they feel it should be, etc..."
bad,"Work over 50 hrs a week. Worked 73 the week I was terminated. Its not if your a good worker or not, its who you know or what your last name is that determines if you get advancement in the company. They act like they are family oriented but don't care what you have going on outside of work. I got pointed for the birth of my children (twice) because they came early."
bad,Night shift go to work at 4:30pm and get off round 3am Monday through Thursday. Friday or Saturday you can get off 6am if there's no work the next day.
bad,"Not enuff off time but will allow you to work many hours as possible, strict attendance policy, hours from 7-6 lunch from 12-1 peaceful environment with numerous egos"
bad,"Good pay, good benefits, hard work, dirty, noisy, worked in maintenance."
bad,"Upper management gave me a lot of their work and false hope that it would help me to promote which never happened. I had asked to be cross trained in different departments to be a more valuable asset to the company which never happened as others with less experience were moved up past me.A lot of politics and ""buddy system"" values in upper management."
bad,unorganized need better certified maintenance to work on machines adknowledge the hard workers and not over them stick to the policy and not only use the book on certain employee's
bad,"Like every almost every job you will have ups and downs . Tyson missons and values are not taking seriously , qualified individuals are often overlooked and the management promotes based on seniority instead of promoted the person who is most qualified."
bad,"No training that was given you were expected to know how to operate the machinery on your own, no assistance in lifting anything heavy. "
bad,"I f you don't have a wife and kids at home and don't mind never having a life outside of Tysons then this the job for you. They work you until your burnt out then replace you like you was nothing.  They do the buddy buddy system to rise up through the ranks in managment also, it's never a fair move even if someone else is more certified and a better candidate for the position."
bad,It used to be fun to work for Tyson's but the enjoyment is gone and folks don't know from day to day if they will have a job the next day.  It seems they are terminating all employees that have any seniority.
bad,This place is the hardest place I've every worked. The plant manger is very hard to deal with the turn over rate is out the roof. The work really isn't that bad. You are just expected to put Tyson 1St in your life and Family is in second over wise you get penalized for take time off for your Family even in emergencys. you get half a point for being one min late you get half a point for punching out one min early you get a point for going to the doc with it with out a note doesn't matter. It's as strict as the military. You'll be fine as long as you have no life other then Tyson.
bad,Tyson foods is a very stressful environment. It is very fast paced. Supervisors and HR do not tend to their employees as they should. It is very hard to tend to your injuries at your own doctor without getting points added.
bad,Tyson is a great company with great benefits but its management team sucks. their lack of professionalism is very high. sometimes it feels like everybody is in competition with everybody
bad,"The Tysons foods in North Little Rock, Arkansas was ran by the kind of management that I would follow and would love to be a part of. Then on the other hand. I transferred to the Tysons food in Dallas,Tx and I’ve never worked in an  environment so cut throat filled with  animosity. And there’s people there who hadn’t had a pay raise in 3 years."
bad,Very harsh and dangerous environment with a work schedule that does not adequately allow for work life balance.  It is extremely hot in one area and extremely cold in other areas.
bad,"A really nice place to work at, until they were bought out by Tyson Foods.  Then 6 months after buyout, plant was shut down, on two week notice.  Just a total corporate devestation to a good local company."
bad,"When I began my employment here it was a good place and I liked it very much. The supervisor was good and the coworkers were great. After my first year there it all went downhill. The leads and superiors turned there heads and concerns for proper procedure and only worked to get numbers. The facility was breaking down around them and rather than make proper repairs they chose to ignore the problems, and there were many of them."
bad,It was a good job benefit wise but too strick. Lack of upper management and worker relationships and or communication. High expectations for  extensive work and long hours
bad,I love the team members at Tyson but some of the management is just disrespectful.The hours in my department are 6-7 days a week 11-12 hours a day. You are already tired and for some management to talk to you the way they do is uncalled for.
bad,"Prior to the previous CEO's resignation Tyson Foods, the culture and environment were excellent. With the new senior management the culture and environment have declined."
bad,"This environment was different.  You could show up to work one day managing the Kill line, and as you walk in to suit up for work, your manager would tell you that you are now managing the Refrigeration unit....work 7 days a week, 12 hrs a day for 40K a year."
bad,Makes you feel like you in prison very controlling company doesnt care about there workers there more worried about they product the pay sounds good until you actually do the work follow you all over the place even when you to cold
bad,Too many felons I've heard people getting jumped and stabbed on shift I was on just never witnessed anything thank goodness did almost get robbed once but too many people around so I snuck away to manager
bad,I don't think I have ever been spoken to in such a way by any manager I have ever had. I was also told during my job interview I would have to work every third Saturday and that quickly blossomed into every other weekend to include the Sunday of the weekend. I have been a laboratory manager for over 20 years and have never been so unhappy in the workplace. I like the people who report to me and I like the work. I just have issues with the atmosphere. It is very depressing.
bad,"The typical day at Tyson was hectic from the equipment failing ,favortism to certain employees and poor managment to the entire system to which you have to go through to move up in company. They go by a point system which is  bias experience and knowledge to perform task or job is overlooked but perfect attendance and sort of perfect attendance gets high praised. I have learned alot of new skills that will transfer into other job endeavors thanks to a particular supervisor that saw the abilities of hard dedicated worker, perfectionist and quick learner in me. Other than than important paperwork was often misplaced , not turned in at proper time , higher up managment was not in tune with majority of the employees unless you were from their town/city.My co-workers were great we helped each other often but at times got chastised for helping one another without given orders from our supervisor which makes no sense at all to me. The hardest part to me was the long hours and how they did things upon completing the interview and application future employees were asked if we were willing to do overtime but they never stated in paperwork that the overtime was mandatory, legally given perks were often bended to suit the needs of the managment, the work load was alot different depending on the shift due to favortism .The most enjoyable part was the experience of how our food gets prepared"
bad,As my first official job of some importance I learned a lot of valuable lessons working for this company. Some lessons good and other bad. Watched favoritism at it's finest. But in all I liked my job not the conditions but the experience of overseeing good quality of a product.
bad,All the supervisors care about is how much chicken they can push through line to get their bonus or how many upper management they can sleep with to get higher in company horrible place to work don't do it they fake bone checks they pick chicken from floor and put back on line just nasty
bad,i really loved my job however the environment and management make the job unbearable im packed drums in package tray at a fastr ate working on production
bad,Employees are great and fun to be around but this company has way to many supervisors. Had a good time while I was there but work was getting slow and they were letting people go home or stay home 2 and 3 days a week. One supervisor even gave a guy 2 weeks off and logged it in under no work so he could try out another job somewhere else. VERY POOR MORAL!
bad,I liked going to work but management made it very difficult to be happy at work.
bad,"load line, learn the processed chickens, good  co-worker, long hour"
bad,"I started off at Temperanceville, Va and it was one of the best if not the best place I have worked. Great people, especially fellow managers, especially Plant and Complex.                                                    "
bad,I would not refer anyone to this facility. There are too many culture's brought in to this country to be employed at Tyson's where Tyson's refuses to help teach work ethics to cultures unaware of the importance of ethics. Tyson's should be held responsible for taking care of such individuals and culture's if they are to continue to recruit from outside the normal working society. A strong workforce absolutely cannot be built upon a foundation where 50% of your workforce has no ethics or lack of communication skills.
bad,"I started as an operator with the company at the beginning of the start up of the plant. In the first year there were growing pains for everyone, to especially include me! I came in with an open mind and my natural get it done attitude. I am a natural leader and I strive to be the best at everything I do, so I naturally took charge of the chaos that comes in any start up production plant. I learn very very quickly and my superiors acknowledged that so as we ramped up I was chosen to be the lead. I had and have very strong support from my employees and co-workers due to my lead by example ways. I love my job but am ready to advance, and find a company that I can make a career of."
bad,Wanted me to choose my work over my family... Wanted to tell me how I should live my life..
bad,"Goodlettsville Plant had a backstabbing dog-eat-dog bunch in Production Supervisor positions. Not any kind of teamwork, lots of gossiping and sabotage- especially if you outshine them and are very good at what you do. management completely ignorant of cultural issues with line workers from various countries and backgrounds. Rule breaking and lawbreaking often behind the scenes. salary not commensurate with hours- 6 day/ week plant w/ much overtime for supervisors. Watched them get rid of multiple Supervisors who did an excellent job and blew the roof off production numbers, excellent with employees, etc. but upper management was easily controlled by brown-nose production supervisors who would talk them into giving someone the axe. I sat quietly and tried to stay out of it all, keeping to myself and eventually quit after I found new work- which was hard to do because I had transferred from another plant and had really loved the company and built seniority with them. Sad."
bad,"If you are seeking a stable, long term position, Tyson is not for you. They perform transformations often where employees are either laid off or demoted. The bottom line, profits, is the only thing this company values. They stress the 5Cs but rarely will you see these demonstrated at the Corporate level."
bad,If you're not in the click with your supervisor your job is not safe so beware of the bull coming your way they will ride you until you and they will find a way to get ride of you if you're not in the click
bad,"My experience wasn't great.  Although I met some great people, there is a culture of fear due to exceptionally poor management within the maintenance department."
bad,Moneys good but this job will control your life from morning to night.. If 15 hour dayz if u go home your fired. Jail house rock. Management is under experienced and it shows.
bad,It’s a good job if you have older kids or if you have help with your kids. Great pay with a lot of over time..and very cold. It’s a processing plant..
bad,I never got a raise there I was there for a year. My supervisor visor absolutely hated me if anything bad happened he blamed it on me an said it was my responsibility when I had nothing to do with that area. Half the time I felt like I was doing his job.
bad,"They claim to have equal opportunity for all team members but are more about Spanish speaking team members. Key positions are held by them and very few blacks in lead positions. It’s a nightmare working there especially as a black person. Cumming plant needs to be visited by the department of Labor!! So much injustice to the poor blacks working  tirelessly,  one day one trouble if you are black."
bad,Employees do whatever they want. Take long breaks disappear from the line and never reprimanded. Safety is just a pledge they make you say daily. If they can break the union and get rid of lazy senior employees it would help. We have lost several maintenance men because of upper management.
bad,On typical days you come in change into your gear then head down to the raw meat area and wait in line to clock in. then you head down to find out what line you will be on. then go about the day on the line assigned.
bad,Management acknowledges they underestimated the transition that things would be better next year. I worked 10 to 12 hours daily essentially doing two peoples work. There were promises of extra help but no consistent and sustainable help was ever given. When vacations and sick days were needed there was not even a visit from management to check and see how things were going or if it was overwhelming. I learned that if a clear plan is not in place you drift from problem to problem never making a sustainable fix and then return to try and fix again. Very frustrating. Workplace culture recognizes that most issues are needing multiple departments to correct so problem solving meetings are organized to solve even easy fix issues. Hardest part of the job was trying to convince management to see the big picture.  I did enjoy working with people and the challenges.
bad,just having alot of issues here with my supervisor and doing a job i didnt apply for and cut my pay hoping for improvement but i am also looking for a better job
bad,This place is for people with bad records to work without judgement. They have pay that equals some of the best jobs. Overall it is a pretty good place to work just dont get caught up in the drama.
bad,It was a ok place to work but the hire management was never honest and didn't treat people right very disrespectful working enviorment no trust in some supervisors
bad,workplace culture was not good. racist. they spit in the floors and management didn't do anything about it. not clean or sanitary. need to get people in there who can and want to work.
bad,"Found it hard to get to know my job, because the associate training me did not speak English to well. Think they need to get someone who speaks English to train there employees."
bad,No me gusto para nada pagan muy poquito exigentes.
bad,I have nothing to say about this company. It was a stressful workplace to work. The management seems like they did not care for the employee's. As long the employee's was just getting the chickens off the line fast.
bad,"Human resource and nursing don't know how to do their job.there are favorites, some work harder than others , show favoritism.And they they got rid of the best supervisor ever.Ove some stupid things."
bad,"Tyson Foods i will say its good for anyone that's looking for a job to start off, but not long term. You will have to work around supervisors and managers that shows favoritism and lack of employee appreciation"
bad,I would never work for this place again if it was the last place on the plant they got out of a contract a year and half early and I decided to stay and hold out till the last day I got a bouns that was 250 dollars for staying and was told I was gonna get my education payed for so I could go back to school that didn't happen so I would not recommend working for this company they only care about them selves not the people that work for them
bad,"My forklift burst into flames today and they decided to put me on a different one with no windshield or doors so chicken poo flew I at me and hit me in the face. The weather is so cold and they still haven't given me my ppe ( reflective bibs, coveralls, gloves etc.). Very poor place to work. It's also sad I have the most dangerous job out there and I get paid the lowest!"
bad,the management team is not at all worth the mental stability  they show favoritism towards certain people. I did learn a lot of skills but overall I would never want to work there again.
bad,If you like to be put down this is the place to work. They Cater to every wim of Somalian’s they get extra time to Pray everyday while we cover their work. In Managing eyes they do no wrong. Some of us have to put up with Screaming leads & Managment because they don’t like you. I’m still here only for the pay however I am looking elsewhere. They claim to be Family Oriented but they could care less.
bad,Not a good paying job. Great job for someone who is starting out and need experience. Friendly environment and flexible schedule. Hardest part of the job would be the pay.
bad,Tyson is going to pay employees a wage that can pay the bills. It's is however a stressful job. There are not alot options here as far as jobs are concerned so Tyson is a stepping stone.
bad,"more managers than they know what to do with.  They don't know what the other managers are doing.  Things happen in one area that affects another area, but no body communicates the issues to each other."
bad,Stressful day at work. The hardest part of the job was having to spend the night in order to install a new software system. My manager and coworkers were amazing. The smell from the pork bellies on the floor took some getting use to.
bad,"Great employees, poorly managed. poor supervisors and managers terrible benefits package, over worked employees under appreciated. Company needs to prepare their supervisors better."
bad,"management is very ill-educated so the company suffers"
bad,"Its not really hard, just the people make it difficult sometimes, Management is good, Supervisor's are decent, Pays the bills and benefits are great. Good work environment."
bad,"If you need a job, it works. No life work balance. If you're a woman, forget about advancing. Don't expect to get great pay, they pay less than the average for a production supervisor position at other companies."
bad,"Company need to work hard at any poultry plant in understand that people needs life work balance. The lack of leadership in the plant areas is big, therefore a new changes would be important."
bad,"The plant that I worked for would work you until they physically broke you, then put you on light duty and point you out despite actually being at work. The union rep was completely useless. Good job and benefits while it lasted though."
bad,"Two months after i started working forTyson they sent me to Sherman Texas to observe their sister plants hamburger line, because,Tyson Council bluffs .IA is currently adding. 10 hamburger lines, and will have them up and running in june. My workday now consists of 12hr days that start at 6am, and most weeks im lucky enough to get a 6 day work week when they have the O.T."
bad,"Just for starters, we have had our jobs rebid twice in the past two years. This means a whole new life as you change shift, starting times, days off, hours of work, and position."
bad,"Very unorganized management. very under paid, its impossible to make a living or support a family based on tyson pay.I needed something better."
bad,"I really didn't care for this job, but I needed a job.  It was very cold in live hang.  Then at the hatchery it was extremely smelly.  The company offered okay benefits."
bad,Basically it was unloading trailers of product and getting that product put into our system.  I learned alot actually from our computer system to tracking product and product trailers.  I also worked alot by myself so I was basically my own supervisor and management trusted me to get my duties done in a timely manor.  I loved working with my co-workers everyday.   The hardest part of the job was it seemed like management didn't want me there or it seemed like nothing I did was good enough but I kept trying and working hard.   The best part of job was just going to work every day.   I loved the work the people and even after 14 years there I still loved the work.
bad,"I work so hard, I feel as though my supervisors don't appreciate me or my co-workers, and we have to stay back a lot, which is hard for me because I have a child at home."
bad,"You have so many duties you are lucky if you even get a break during your 12 hour shift! This company is nothing but ""good ole boys"" and if you're female you are hated for being where they don't think you belong. You are not given the time you need to check or work on your systems unless the plant shuts down because of them. They have you working on so many other things that aren't even part of your job that your equipment goes to crapl. Then you get disciplined for not getting your P.M.'s done."
bad,"All products were released on a daily basis by me as required.  Cook and chilling of all products was the most challenging and enjoyable part of my day.  Dealing with the government on a daily basis would be a challenge but I was always one step ahead of the game.  The operators I trained to do specific jobs, completed their tasks very well and always added feedback and suggestions when pertinent."
bad,"Management is well understaffed, and disorganized. Too many ""favorites"" for people to be treated equally. The work is very taxing on hands and wrists but nothing is done to resolve that issue."
bad,As a contract grower for Tyson Food there are many things that you have to over come and the farmers seem to be forgotten most of the time. It is very hard to make a living just farming only you have to have a outside job so there is no time for anything. You have no benefits as a contract grower.
bad,"This was a cool job in the beginning until I saw how the people who ran it really were . They were very rude and showed a lot of favoritism towards certain individuals whom they were messing with outside of work. They would have of work 07 12 HOURS shifts and wouldn't think twice about your health or anything . All these people care about is the meat being put out if someone has a simple issue they are quick to send you home or worse even fire you jst for speaking your mind. I once had a family issue an had to leave work I reported to the boss as I was supposed to , too let him know that I had to leave due to an emergency an the boss responded ""NO, I DO NOT CARE we don't have anyone else to replace you today so you have to stay"" . I was very unhappy at this job I felt so unwanted , hated and misused in each and everyway .  I will never recommend anyone work for this company and I do mean EVER !"
bad,Plant jobs are not for me ut i just hang in there to support my daughter and I.
bad,"Always short handed due to employees being late or going home early. I was transferred to a different department, my new manager continued to ask me provocative questions. I reported it once he had retrieved my phone number from my work file."
bad,top heavy company with no respect for their workers. its all about management.
bad,"most managers work 10-11 hour shifts. there are many departments with in the plant for supervisors to gain new knowledge and expertise.  as a company Tyson in very large so there is opportunity to move to other plants or move to corporate and pursue other careers.  things like safety, accounting, marketing, sales etc..."
bad,Ok place to work. Very cold lots of over time chances to grow and make more money. Big facility. Easy hiring. 12 hour shifts half week work 3 days and a half
bad,You work at Tyson's then say goodbye to life. No time for nothing but work all day everyday for them. It is really stupid how they treat you there. But it pays the bills.
bad,Get enough rest and time up with your family as possible!.. Utilize your vacation days and prearranged absence (s) thoroughly! Always communicate with your supervisor and team members!
bad,"Its a not bad place to work, but often wont work with your schedule from day shift is like when a store opens till they close. Tyson doesn't offer you chance to go to store than go to work on production. They work you and than don't care about your life. But if you don't care about that stuff than its good to work at."
bad,This job is not for everyone...supervisors aren't well trained...very few Americans work at the location l work for. Basically to many family and friends working there
bad,Tyson was a ok job have alot of Hispanic that couldn't speak English hard to understand a person that can not speak English but other then that job was pretty kool
bad,Worked for several years and was able to advance.  High pressure job. Very little time off with family and friends. Great benefits including retirement and insurance.
bad,Leader ship does not value it’s employees and publicly humiliate people  and has sporadic and inconsistent work Also poor benefits not worth union dues
bad,"To many people worried about what other employees are doing instead of doing the job they are supposed to do. I worked for them for many years in the truck shop it is a good job, but recently the management had lacked in making it a enjoyable and fair environment. They lack the skills to move the establishment forward into the future. There are people leaving weekly"
bad,Too many clicky people are there. Get one mexican mad they lie on you and management that believes that do most of the work will side with them. Management lies all the time and it's a lot of racism  there.
bad,"Has the potential to be a equal chance opportunity employer, but poor management & lack of concern for employees. Provides hours, but fast pace work & a lot of confusion. Work really doesn't have definite get off time"
bad,The job you dread going to! Subzero temps for 12 hours. Unrealistic performance expectations. Huge personnel turnover. Crowded work conditions along with constant threat for lack of job output = the most dangerous work conditions I have ever seen. Don’t ever apply for this job. You can’t make a living at this place. Go to Walmart if you want a steady low paying job. Also poorly maintained equipment. Bad employee attitude because of working conditions. You are threatened with termination at the beginning of each shift!
bad,"Tyson is literally a prison even down to the looks. I feel like I'm on death row. You have NO LIFE.!!! I spend more time here than I do in my home. I work in labeling so it's 12 hours shifts and 6-7 days a week. There point system is a joke. Yes it seems as if 14 points is a lot but in actuality it's not. People have things going on outside of work. Especially if you have children. You have Dr. Visits, classroom activities, sickness etc. I don't think they need to do away with current management but they do need some form of training to better manage and be more productive. This is a job for single people with no children. There is no work/life balance. The pay is ok for this area but better believe you're definitely going to work hard for it.  I'm a very hard worker and not lazy by a Longshot but sometimes I feel more like a slave than an employee..."
bad,"I worked in R&D  and there is much mismanagement, you are away from home a lot and there is no room for advancement. you will have to wait years to move up."
bad,"It's not easy. It's very fast paced and speed. But it's a great place to make quick money, the pay is good. But not a place to work for a long time there"
bad,I would say a typical day at this plant was challenging and very well under managed by the plants upper leadership half the time things were out of wack and very confusing. The best part was getting paid weekly.
bad,"i have never done this type of work and it was a good experience ,but i was not fast enough and it was very cold,you stand on concrete all day long and i really liked working with the people"
bad,The lead that I had got onto me because I was trying to help the next person out and the lead barely trained me on my job I was doing. I was told a few steps that's all.
bad,Work to many Saturdays. Only have two holidays off (Thanksgiving and Christmas) and there are so much disrespect from managers to supervisors and from employees to supervisors.
bad,They ain't looking for full time employees. Only hiring temps through others resources and releasing after 90 day employment. Work ain't hard but dangerous if you are careless
bad,"I had a great foreman, would let you go to dr. appointments and other appointments too. The GPM and HR didn't care. I lost my leg in a accident. HR wanted me to do a job someone lost their hand 2 months before I returned. Maybe if I was really broke and starving I might return."
bad,"worked in stock room. fast paced, no breaks minus lunch, supers dont care whats going on. they work you until you break and turnover is high. too many moving people"
bad,I only worked for Tyson for a short period of time before moving back to Texas. It was a workplace with various different cultures from central america to Somalia to Asia. I never really had opportunity to move up in company nor did have time to meet and converse with coworkers. Therefore I don't have much I can say about this job.
bad,"If you're not Mexican or Burmese, they treat you like you're worthless. The supervisors lie to your face, will try to write you up for something you didn't even do, and the union is a joke...they do the absolute bare minimum to help you...unless you're Mexican or Burmese."
bad,I enjoyed working with  the interpreters and various cultures.  
bad,it a productive and fun place to work and alot of good looking women to look at while you work . the cafe is high and the food is not good for the price they charge. biggest problem is LACK OF COMMUNICATION
bad,"It was hard working there because of the work. It wasn't easy and you have to balance your everyday life with your work life."
bad,Tyson food is a place of very poor management.  The team members are treated so unfair. People of higher authority personal deal with the team members. Very unprofessional place
bad,"Its not a bad job it just wasnt for me, I have goals that i wanna reach, and working there wasnt gonna help me reach that goal.The insurance is the best thing working at tyson"
bad,it was very cold i really wasnt a hard job a great work place just couldnt work arount dead chickens i wasnt there to learn much management far as i could tell they ran it pretty fair
bad,"Tyson is a place where you are expected to fulfill many roles, but not be trained on any in advance. You are expected to figure it out all on your own."
bad,"I enjoyed making friends and making sure my job was done right when Im inside, I felt professional just because I was a Qaulity Assurance Tech. My QA supervisor always got mad if I left work early because I got the flu"
bad,"Tyson, in my opinion, have under-qualified human resource staff. The supervisors don't seem to care much for the employees, they seem more interested in meeting a quota, even at the expense of those they lead. Supervisors should be trained outside of Tyson as to how to manage or lead people and treat them the way they want to be treated."
bad,Would not suggest working at Tysons. To much favoritism with the supervisors. Friendship with Supervisor and employee makes it hard for other employees.
bad,"Working for Tyson Seafood was a good start, and after few months started change the management, bring staff from chickens industry in fishing industry til Company filled for bankruptcy."
bad,"Typically a day starts at 5 am. I have laid hands on practical training from what I did in my coursework. Working culture is great, although I would like to advance into a more mind jogging like analytical and product development related job."
bad,"Water fountains are far from work areas. Restrooms are far too.When loading the forklifts with pallets, you lose control of your grip on high altitude. Icy floors. Unsafe work area"
bad,Job was too stressful and cold for me.. stood on my feet for long hours without breaks ... but the people there where good spirited and the pay was okay
bad,"Over worked , management does not care about the workers health.  Very disrespectful environment. Rude staff from managers all the way to the cafeteria. Rude nurse"
bad,When I worked there it was boring and very hot. You are always sweating and covered in feathers. It's also loud and always wet. The pay sucked it was just a bit over minimum wage and was bearly getting any hrs.
bad,The 12 year i spend at tyson was the worst but in all good benefits and you make the money but too tired to spend it. the management and hr is very poor and need better work ethics and respect toward the workers. I would never go back to work there.
bad,"You never knew what time you would get out of work. Always worked on Saturdays. You had no time for a personal life or to go and do anything as you were always so tired. You ended up working 60 hours a week. Money was good but at the end think about it, who is going to enjoy it? There was so many times I was so tired driving home I ended up driving on the other side of the road. Supervisors only care about themselves. Management is pretty good. However to complain about a supervisor you can forget about it."
bad,"Primeira Empresa boa de trabalhar,aprendi trabalhar em equipe."
bad,Working for a few years now its okay work the night shift. Coworker are good chicken we produce is good. Working nights u get use to it and u make a little extra.
bad,"It's okay, not very diverse but a great learning experience. I enjoyed learning the works of an assembly line just disliked the distance from everything."
bad,This Tyson is no  longer in business. It was very cold and wet. The assembly line was very fast. It damaged a lot of people hands from having to use scissors or a knife at a really fast pace.
bad,operated forklift/lifts that did not work properly. Worked with individuals that did not do their jobs. Management showed a lot of favoritism to particular employees.
bad,Tyson Foods is a very productive and fast-pace plant. The hardest part of the job is when the shoulder cutters doesn't pull their shoulders down which makes it more difficult to detach the breast.
bad,work was so high paced that it was hard to give them a quality job when performing a task. wages were sub par if you have any kind of education/decent experience.
bad,Although this is a great job the problems with the job start at the pay and the lies the employer says. when hired yes you start at 10.00 but you see soon there is not much in the way of raises.
bad,you get paid to freeze your butt off and not have a life management is bad co workers are rude the hardest part of the day is clocking in and most enjoyable is walking out of the door knowing youre free what i learned is that i need to go back to school so i dont have to work a dead end job ever again
bad,I've been with the company for almost 4 years now. it a descent job that will make it where u can pay most bills. with working long hours with minimum pay wages. also where management doesn't care about product or worker.
bad,High workload and extremely fast paced. Extreme hot and cold environments with different levels of cleanliness. Productions driven all the way around.
bad,"I have wasted my time filing three OSHA whistleblower complaints. A handful of workers including me, have been terminated for reporting unsafe and unsanitary conditions or management ethics violations. The scale tech department had to bring the aerospace union into the plant due to the amount of harassment they were receiving. Workers are being threatened into giving false testimony against injured workers or other loudmouths, making it possible to accuse anyone of anything and still look ""legal"". The highest individual you can appeal to, the Regional Haman Resources Director is himself the chief crook."
bad,"if wouldnt have beeen on overnight, i might still be there .. enjoyed most people but need be a stronger family oriented company"
bad,"Worst corporate culture I ever worked. Upper mgt./HR do nothing to support middle mgt., Morale is worse than bad. Turnover rate indicative of overall problems."
bad,"By far the worst job I've had. The smell was horrible and the long hours were even worst. They went by a point system and whenever you called in you would get a point added, wheather you werer sick or not. If you get over 14 you would be fired."
bad,"This job is just...Not worth your time. It doesn't matter how desperate you might be for a job, don't go here. Orientation goes quite nicely, and even when they hire you they seem nice, but that's kind of where it ends. After you go into your training, people will be nice for a few days, but as soon as you make one wrong move, everybody starts talking about you behind your back and refusing to help you if you don't understand or you are unsure of something. These people convince you that your job is more important than your health because they threaten you with a stupid attendance policy. If you get 3 points before your 90 days is up, you get fired. Of course, you lose points by calling in. If you go home early, you lose points. The point system sets you up to fail. If you are going to be late or anything, you have to call in to an automated line, rather than talk to an actual person. Even if you're going to be like 5 minutes late. The employees will talk about you behind your back on a regular basis. There is absolutely no team work going on in this atmosphere. Especially since half of the USDA workers don't make an effort to do their job. There's at least three of them who fall asleep on the job AND GET AWAY WITH IT!!!. The company is a bunch of cheapskakes. They literally charge you for everything. They are constantly charging you for SOMETHING. they charge you for any supplies you need, they charge you for lunch, they will even charge you for a cup of ice. Heck, I'm surprised they don't charge you to go to the bathroom. A lot of the staff isn't very friendly, and a good"
bad,"Things were quite hectic from time to time, which wasn't anything that I couldn't handle. There seemed to be a lack of motivation from other co workers and minimal interaction with supervisors, which motivated me to take charge of things more often. Work was redundant, hours were stifling."
bad,"I basically was the man known through the plant as one off the best workers it was very cold sometimes, but i managed. I have been pursuing my degree for quite sometime, so i opted to leave to enroll in school."
bad,"not really much to describe. assembly line set up, cold, nasty floors, but quality product."
bad,"I worked at Sara Lee 17 years I ran every machine in the plant .I cleaned all the machines molder,ovens mixers ,dividers I loved working for the bakery at the end I had some problems concerns I went to management with and they decided to let me go.I have had a hard time finding full time employment so am looking for a dependable job who need a dependable worker."
bad,"Easy, steady job, the only thing was the temp agency that hired me for sara lee didn't give me any hours, so they had me on-call but I can say I did like my job."
bad,"The hours were great. Pay was great. Hard work, kept me busy."
bad,Do not sign up for the slicer job. I have done it and its the worst job in the world.
bad,"first experience in a facility of this nature. Very active and competative among the employees and management. Fast pased enviroment. Small work force, high demands, long shifts. Was able to work up to a supervisory role only to be let go due to restructuring."
bad,The only thing that is really good about this company was the insurance.
bad,Not a very good place to work. The only positive thing is the money and the hours available. They sweep all of the problems under the rug. HR doesn’t care unless it benefits them
bad,"Tyson is a family friendly place to work however, the pay should be a little more for the work that is required. U are able to move up in the company."
bad,The job was a dirty job worked with knifes and worked with blood and raw meat was a very physical job most days where the same worked very hard everyday and communicated with my co worker daily was the good part of the job made the days go by fast but worked in a very cold freezer but enjoyed the skills I learned
bad,"6 days a week in most jobs at the facility. "
bad,The supervisor did what he wanted and had more complaints against him and still havent been discipline.some supervisors were great to work for and some eas just getting overtime
bad,For being such a large business you'd think they would pay their employees better. But since they employed 70-80% immigrants they could get away with capping the base pay around $14.
bad,"Co-workers are dedicated, loyal, hard working team players! "
bad,"They seemed to always be short staffed, always behind, and working past allotted hours..  Which really puts stress on the body and strains home issues."
bad,"Transportation division has low moral. It's a revolving door. The waits can be long 1-17 hrs at any dock including tyson or customers and you get no detention ever ,However they pay layover after 18 hrs or truck not going over a couple hundred miles. It's"
bad,"Tyson could slow their production lines down so the team members can get better quality meat. "
bad,It's all right but the management is awful they all for them selves there is no team work I was the first to catch on to my job assignment I didn't even get appreciated just tried to use me
bad,"While I liked most of the people I had to associate with at Tyson, the work/life balance was not good, the management is all for themselves, and the human resources department is a joke."
bad,"Good job stay busy at all times until things get backed up. That's a problem, pushes us to work harder. No matter what they have me doing I'm always busy; pushing barrels, giving out breaks (On the line deboning chicken thighs), or pulling tubs out of the cooler I'm always working."
bad,"Job was long and gruesome hours. promised to get you home when it was time, but would reroute you some place else, instead on sending a load that would allow you to get home to family."
bad,Only 2 because it’s not a company that praises the hard workers it will teach you need patience and a strong back bone in order to work there and show up day to day
bad,I really never wanted to work here. But I needed something for my family. The job was never fulfilling. I wanted and needed more for myself and my family.
bad,"A typical day of work included addressing the attendance issue and shutting down lines.  I learned to constantly be covering myself through documentation of events, Tyson Foods management...overall, an immoral group of management personel  with conflicting views of TM and lower management rights when compared to policy, constant manipulation of TM situations by select supervisors, at least at the Portland Indiana facility. The hardest part of the job was addressing TM issues. The most enjoyable part of the job was when the team worked together toward a common goal despite any mechanical or scheduling issues ,and prevailed with a positive variance which would lead into the next scheduled shift."
bad,"a good place to work if you are looking for a second chance, and have no life and family , all the overtime you want , but no end in sight, just live now."
bad,"Worked in Amherst, Ohio and the pay is way too low for the monotony and pace of production that is put out in an 8 hour Shift. Other states with Tyson pay much better than Amherst, Ohio. And you only get two breaks in an 8 hour shift. And you got to stand on straight concrete with no mats under your feet to help support your back and lower legs."
bad,It would be a fun job if the temperature wasnt freezing below 0 degrees on top of you using a pressure hose to clean all the meat machinery it can be very overwhelming if your not use to working in the cold
bad,The job is not bad depends on department and what your doing. Onsite cafeteria. Has all three shifts available. Cold occasionally wet environment. Usually don't work Sunday's.
bad,they allow you to come and go as you please but give you points for family emergencies the supervisors are rude the plant is poorly managed theres not very good communication
bad,very hard work and they don't seem to care how long you work or if you get a day off. has gone through several changes in management over the last year and only seems to be getting worse.
bad,"Typical day at work would vary, i learned how to clean operated machines and the management was ok but a little careless. Also a lot of the workers were mean and the hardest part of the job was that supervisors made the job harder than it had to be. The most enjoyable part of the job was when i got my pay check"
bad,Tyson foods wasn't a hard job but it was very cold. Had to wear more clothes & got overheated once. Sometimes the lines would be backed up really bad. Had to throw a lot of product away cause it fell on the floor. And you'd get splashed with raw chicken juice
bad,"A Houston plant is too much politics as a incorporate work place. HR department is under control of the plant manager. Management team is unprofessional, unfair, and also lier."
bad,"There was a lot of misunderstanding with how they would pay me. I really don't have much to say honestly the company is a good place to work, there was just a big understanding about my pay i was getting paid 10.00 as a temp then after my 90 days was up to get hired as permanent i was still getting paid as a temp and i worked 2 months. That didn't sit well with me at all."
bad,I didn't like working here mainly because of the slow paced repetitive nature of the job. However the shift management and leads were always available for questions and were willing to explain and show you how to do something if you didn't understand
bad,Good atmosphere and good place to work and support your family. Have learned a lot about production and safe quality food.
bad,"Its always a rough start. Always picking up other people slack, i feel like they dont understand the concept of teamwork and its not an environment im used to. Also there is limited communication due language diferrence"
bad,"I learned how to de-bone a ham"
bad,Working long hours and saturdays give very little time to recoup from a long week leaves next to no time to have a social life. Spend most of my days off asleep.
bad,"Working with alot of numbers.I did not like it too much."
bad,I liked working at tyson but i worked in the outside setting like in a warehouse doing inventory and they did not have a air cond. and it was very house alot of people got to hot and passed out. We had told them but they were like they did not care about us.
bad,"The recent spinoff of Sara Lee has not quite learned how to properly structure a management team. Perhaps the most obvious indicator of this is upper-level management's tendency to say one thing and do another- even in quarters where financial performance is below street expectations, the top level management team still felt that they earned upwards of 200% raises...but buyer beware- the company has slashed benefits to lower level employees as a ""cost savings"". A number of the employees have faith in the company and have stayed the course thusfar...but you don't have to look far to feel a general sense of dissatisfaction confirmed by recent high turnover."
bad,Tough work and it is work. Pay is okay not much overtime allowed.
bad,its a smelly job. makes your stomach weak. they work you way too hard. i almost passed out a few times due to no break.
bad,Too many people with different goals instead of alot of people for one goal.
bad,"Typical days at work were heavily focused on cost reduction. This included job combinations and eliminations required to become competetive in the Deli industry. I gained first hand experience in crisis mode management and doing whatever it takes to reduce cost under dfficult circumstances. This also became one of the most difficult parts of the job. Although Tyson as a whole is an admirable company with high standards and successful operations, the particular division where I worked is struggling and created a very difficult work experience."
bad,"Tyson (Springdale) is a leader due to its sheer size, only. It lacks a friendly working environment, stable executive and senior management group, and work and family balance."
bad,"really busy, unpridictable .hours not enough to maintain family lifestyle.management ok. coworkers ok, job is really not that hard."
bad,"Great for someone that loves to work with there hands, hard labor, and is not for a parent with very small children."
bad,Plant philosophy of lazy fare. Culture of operating at the level of the lowest common denominator. Suppress individual desire to increase one's horizons of knowledge and professional abilities.
bad,"I don't speak negatively about prior employers. Old equipment, rush, rush. I'd rather do it right the first time. Temporary fixes become permanent. is my motto. Good people , communication lacking."
bad,"Because Tyson Foods has welcomed the worthless labor union into their facilities, they must now protect, preserve and coddle the lazy and there are a lot of lazy people at Tyson"
bad,It all depends on where you work within the factory how easy and how much you get paid. I got base pay and I liked it. The management was kind of very strick and confusing. For my first job though I like it.
bad,The places starting pay was very low but they offered full time hours and decent health care with vision and dental insurance. After one year the pay was better and the management was decent.
bad,They are all about a snitch culture nothing else. Management don't care about the workers only quota's and their meeting of goals for their quarterly bonus payouts.
bad,The job was to stressful plus management stunk was not an easy place to work because they leave you so short handed which makes your job ten times more stressful
bad,"Poor work life balance, unless you work in corporate offices. Production plants and distribution centers beware, long hours ahead and some form of weekend work is always incorporated. Set schedules are in place with the option for management to issue ""mandatory overtime"". If you don't show up for these ""extra"" shifts they will count against your attendance record and can ultimately get you terminated."
bad,Tyson Foods could pay there employees more. The job that I have as a Forklift operator is very under paid compared to other companies around our county
bad,A typical work day will be stressful if u let it its a fast pacce plant and u have to kno what your doing to survive............................................
bad,"Fast paced,  stressful, no teamwork. Managers that shouldn't have that title and have absolutely no experience directly people or being respectful. Especially if you're not Hispanic."
bad,bad working conditions no weekends off one day a week off at company's discretion. Management skills were very poor very poor manage maintenance manager. Good thing about Tyson the benefits were excellent the pay was okay lack of time off was the main issue at Tyson no weekends off for no one
bad,"The pay was great, but you just don't matter at all. I would work overtime and double shifts regulary, but when i had safety concerns,  they were swept under the rug or ignored altogether."
bad,It was okay but didn’t have a life outside of there because we was always there. Don’t care about well being. Also they expect for you to continue working when you’ll sick can be passing out an it still wouldn’t matter to the staff. Which is sad.
bad,"It was a hostile environment, I did not enjoy the foul language spoken around me. Management was not helpful, they cared more about getting the job finished rather than how it got accomplished"
bad,"If you work fast, and more productive than an employee that's been there for a decade or longer, those individuals will find a way to get you fired. Being paid by commission or piece meal, by productivity would be a great paying job on production line. I only worked there to hopefully get hired into maintenance in which my life experience is that. Unfortunately they refused to transfer me."
bad,"tyson is not a very good place to work. they dont care how a job gets done or who does it, as long as it gets done. they dont care if you use unsafe practices to do the job, as long as you dont get caught."
bad,One of the easiest jobs made difficult by unskilled management not knowledgeable about the job. Work 9-10 hour days 6-7 days a week. If you are lucky you will see a note on the wall changing your work schedule. But do NOT expect to be notified like normal professional companies. Simply put..........over 5 years of service and they struggle with communication..
bad,"Management is poor. They say they care about their employees but have a funny way of showing it. You go to them with an issue they make it worse. Gossip more than the production worker, Very unprofessional. Your best bet is to work on first shift when the upper management is on the floor."
bad,Nothing good at all ..harsh environment. Climate controlled .it takes about 90 days until u get your real pay otherwise u start off with 9.50
bad,I like my job but shouldn't I love the job I do the jobs are not hard to do its just what you make it but the people and managers makes it hard for you
bad,They hype it up so big as how great it is then once your in they change all the rules. nothing is ran as they say during orientation. they even go as far as to say you own your job that you bid on then even though your doing your job if you make someone else fix their error to continue your job turning out right they have a problem. quantity not quality.
bad,"Good pay, good benefits, people who work there act like you are in high school all over again. The gossip is unreal.................................................."
bad,sunday thru monday means nothing you work on avg 13 to 27 day before u get a day of . your money isnt ever right and if u doñt say anything about it you wont get it the trucks are old and run down and they wont fix  them but alway telling you we're getting new ones that never come
bad,"Clock in at 7:55, and get my smock,gloves, and hair nets. Be on the floor at 8. Stand and stack different varieties of chicken on 8 high racks. Pushing each stacked 8 high rack into aisle and start another one for 8 hours a day"
bad,"Hillshire is a traditional CPG company.  There tends to be a lot of rules regarding interacting with executives, although they are very approachable, senior managers will ask that you do not build relationships up the hierarchy chain."
bad,we work everyday 12 hours/day. i have no time with family.  the benefits are not up to par and management has poor communication skills.
bad,"A typical day at work consist with a constant battle between the Union and the Company."
bad,not a bad place to work but high pressure to keep equipment running most team members are good hard working people and I guess that is why I am still there
bad,"Start off by turning on the Box machines so by the time i get them set up and ready to run the glue pods should be warmed up and ready to go .Once you've completed your setup i make 4000 boxes for the line to use before they get here and start up. I then clean them up and have them ready for 2nd shift. Next i make sure everyone and everything is where it's supposed to be when the chicken comes out of he chillers. As i am doing all that the PAC-mac and the hichita are getting turned on by me and i run a couple of cycles through so i can have it completely ready, which i do, I now continue and re supply the line as needed. Basic day without writing a novel. Thank you!"
bad,Jobs gives plenty of hours but if you work in a certain department on night shift you would always work 1 to 4 hours over. You have a hour break but it is broken down into two 30 minute breaks. Some of the people that are assigned to train you in a certain area or position are really helpful while others may just leave you to learn on your own.
bad,A typical day at work involves line work. Management leaves it up to the leads for day to day interaction. My co-workers are excellent. The most enjoyable part of my job is realizing just how much as a team we produce in one shift
bad,"not a great place to work, but it paid the bills. working graveyard shift was more fun the working during production hours."
bad,"good steady job. pays good, good benefits. easy job to keep but repetitive work"
bad,"Working here was ok for a start, but I did not enjoy the environment. The work was at a fast pace and it was a challenge working in the cold. Management did their job. Co-worker did their work as a team. The hardest part of working in here was the cold environment when I worked at this job. The most enjoyable part was that I had a job and it was a new start for me back then."
bad,"Good job working maintenance. Learned the value of teamwork.The most enjoyable part of job, working with some of the co workers"
bad,"Its freezing cold, I learned how to trim and press bellys and how to tape at a fast pace without getting behind, co workers are good people the hardest part is standing in the cold for ten hours with short breaks the most enjoyable part is your off days and when you get paid"
bad,"Tyson wants people to fall in love with Tyson and retire from Tyson.  They focus on each individual being a part of the machine and do not want any one not willing to drink the ""we're your family now"" kool-aid.  Most of the people are ""lifers"", that love the North West Arkansas area (corporate headquarters), went to the University of Arkansas, and live for Arkansas Razorback football.  Seriously, it's ridiculous.  If you like all this and want to sit in a cube and collect a paycheck, then go to work for Tyson."
bad,standing long hours and the smell of the place isnt for everybody.make enough money to make a living with the oppertunity to be promoted
bad,"I enjoyed working no typical days and no hard time,but i did enjoyed working with everybody.Work is fun and work is me..."
bad,the company has chosen to reduce costs by outsourcing a good portion of the work.
bad,"Tyson Foods is a very good start out job, it the type of place you could get hooked to stay for ever. The team members are nice and very helpful. Management don't really look at the whole picture and take care of small things. If you really need to work there is lots of overtime. Tyson has been working seven day a week now for about three months. Production line position is always open, younger people is always leaving. The job is simple if you are in production. Management has great benefit, there are not many opening there people seen to stay in this position, clerical job are also few."
bad,A lot of heavy job Lot and lot of hrs bare get weekends off and management is bad. The pay is good vacation suck only get one week vacation after your one years
bad,"Team members treated unfairly! In orientation or meetings they want to know what they can do to keep employees, but they should be asking about how to keep supervisors instead!"
bad,Worked at tyson for ten plus years and they are very unprofessional they use the (good old boy system). Supervisors and management are a joke they talk a good game but dont follow up with anything they say. If you have family dont try and leave they get mad at you. The job is more importantthan your family and personal life they come first.
bad,you go to work early I left early a few hours of work good pay. Worked all year give you benefits like dental medical insurance vision to buy house. Weekly payment you rest on weekends
bad,fast paced and hard work not for someone whom can't keep up.  Management sucks as far as family emergencies and don't get hurt on job they drop whatever they can to screw you out of benefits. ....
bad,I enjoyed my co workers. Great communication skills except with our upper management giving details to us as employees asto what's going on and times we will be getting off from work. Pay was ok but not enough for the everyday damage on hands.
bad,"Very good pay and benefits but very long hours made it difficult to spend time with family,work itself was easy but management and coworkers made it very stressful. Management never responded towards complaints."
bad,"The worst thing about working for this company is the management staff. They're very disorganized like they would say one thing and then another all the time, always understaffed which would put in extra workload and stress on the other quality techs which would be very stressful, not very supportive in the things we do not feeling appreciative but would rather deal with the constant criticism on a daily basis. The only thing for me that was good is the benefits such as 401k, health, dental, and vision insurance, life insurance, and really like the paid time off with sick leave. I learned a lot on quality control since coming from the production floor and no prior experience as a quality control tech I'm forever grateful and would like to grow in that field but in another facility."
bad,"A typical day included getting product out at a fast rate to meet the demands of our clients. The hardest part of the job was the smell sometimes but, I managed to get through it."
bad,"a typical day was 7:20-5:30"
bad,Very poor. Benefits are great. But there is no room to advance. Jobs are usually fast pace and hatchery work means no holiday off if that holiday falls on a production day
bad,Review paperwork
bad,Very poor management. The high stress of the job that I do would make anyone want to quit. Bad communication in the management team as well as with the team members.
bad,Dont really like it but hey its a job management sucks very hot in some areas very very cold in some areas wouldnt really recommend the job to anyone.
bad,Stay focus and make sure you pay attention to your Job and come to work on time and come back on break on time help each other to get the job done! it's alright place for retirement and investment
bad,It's physically challenging.there are many things that can go wrong so you have to be on your toes. You don't always get the help you need. Benifits are very good.
bad,I managed 42 team members and 1 supervisor and 4 support members.  Union Jobs for the hourly's.  Pay was not enough for the work they performed and not enough PPE was provided for the team members.
bad,"must be fast, able to multi-task, under stress, be accountable for all inventory, must be able to receive in a timely manner, work in 56 below zero temperature"
bad,"Unfair about the religion between islam and other. For example: they let the islamic pray during the working time they don't care the catch up or not, so we have to work harder during that praying time, they let islamic go pray 3 times within working hour."
bad,There not to bad to work for if you like to work alot of hours at a blistering pace because they have only about half the people the job calls for   they don't hire extra hands so your screwed if someone calls in
bad,good place to work although management is very poor of service. You really don't have time to spend with family due to employees working on the weekends.
bad,The pay was good for the work. The hours on 2nd shift make it impossible to get enough sleep and anything else done. Supervisor are nice. The team members were all nice.
bad,"Good place to work. "
bad,"The equipment is great..Challenging.. Fun to work on...  What was bad was the maintenance dept. was understaffed, too demanding,  hard to get time to get your breaks. And who wants to work 20 days on and one day off."
bad,"The lady at human resources was barely even in her office when I needed to speak to her and when she was, she was very short with me. The supervisor and team lead over at DSI were even worse. Team lead yells at other employees for stretching their hands, supervisor laughs at team lead for yelling at others, and makes fun of others on the way they talk, plus he was barely even in the work area. Also, he told everyone that a specific job had already been taken when it was not. NOBODY IN MANAGEMENT DOES THEIR JOB CORRECTLY"
bad,Very productive and benifical. It has a safe work enviroment and very orienteering.  Tyson has a friendly staff and most people are willing to give you a helping hand
bad,I liked the people I worked with but the process I was in was not challenging me mentally. I wanted to get more experience in shipping and admin capacities
bad,People not willing to show new employees how to do their job correctly. Alot of employee turnover. Not part of the good ol boys club.
bad,the human resources on 2 shift was horrible. The supervisor too. The shift was suppose to be from 5pm-1:45 sometime we did not get off 4 or 5 in the morning
bad,"Working in the plant was the coldest place i ever worked. And the smell is bad, it's not for everyone. i did like the forklift job.it was on the out side of the plant."
bad,"Checking in all material and ingredients to make our product."
bad,"When i first started working there, it wasn't bad. But then they got bought by Tyson and started slamming my department with 60+ hour work weeks, 6 days a week. I don't care how much money you make if you never have time for your friends and family."
bad,"Tyson Foods was not a healthy environment for me. I freeze when the temperature gets below 72, and my position required that I work in 34 degrees on a daily basis. I was hired to take the bone out of thighs with a special electric knife. Most of the time I was on the line where they weighed chicken and put it into bags. My health deteriorated as I worked there. I would dress in layers in fear of getting too cold and then I would go into super work mode and sweat until I had to go to the nurse. She dried my clothes twice in a day sometimes and somehow when this was happening my blood pressure started acting up and I have been on medicine to keep it regulated since. The management was unfriendly because they were unhappy with their jobs and took it out on everyone. The only thing I got to enjoy there was lunch break. Even then, lunch started when you walked off the floor and when you walk away you have to half way undress before entering the cafeteria and get redressed before your 30 minutes was u and be back at your station."
bad,this job was very stressful and cause injury. Fast paced but need team work and organizing. The hours varies with production and you can go from having 40 hours to 30 very easy. This job goes by the demand of it's customer's. This is the food industry. Lots of heavy lifting which I did not prefer.
bad,Rough job on the hands. Alot of people end up with hands and wrists in extreme pain.
bad,"A typical day at work is always fine. "
bad,"typical day at work usually none,learn to do alote of station at work veriate works as neededm coworkers are very nice learn to speak other languages hardes part of the job is able to do alote at work but gets pay less most enjoyale part of the job is to work with deferent jobs n peopls"
bad,"I worked there for almost 3 years. At first it was a great place to work, it does have great benifits. Some of the supervisors are good people and treat the employees with respect and aknowledge that without the employees there would be no poduct to sell and then there is others who act like they're better than you and try to put you down. The most enjoyable part of the job was the pay check! It paid good but you work so many odd hours that there is no time to spend with your family. I went in at 5pm and most days didn't get off for 15-16hours later and they didn't provide us an extra break which by labor board they are required to. I ended up having to have surgery on my wrists due to carpel tunnel and the supervisor tried to make me do a job aganist my restrictions. and in the cafeteria it costs $5 for a burger you can get at McDonalds for $1."
bad,Its easy work they spend a lot of money and make a lot of money. Management is good they run all day and night da people work around me very funny and nice cool people da hardest part of da job would b when they have expection supervisor has a lot of work 4 u 2 do. The best part of da day is getting off but overall its a job and everybody need work
bad,"I have learn to get the job done by any means no matter how long it takes. Management makes the job harder than it is with imaginary issues. Love my team members through thick & thin, they go the distance for me. Dealing with upper management. Tackling issues with my team."
bad,I liked working here I had the best supervisor that would bend over back wards to help you in any way shape or form but I had transportation issues which caused me to utltuminty lose my job
bad,Poor management u work a lot of overtime including weekends it’s hard to have a life  especially if u in the maintenance department. The Union is for the company and not u even though u pay union dues weekly. They have a very high turnover most of the people that works here are very unhappy.
bad,"This review is specifically for the RVAF plant"
bad,Worked all shifts throughout the plant. Excessive hours and no work/life balance. Good people throughout the plant.  Difficult to attract/retain qualified/skilled supervisors.
bad,Will never work there again for anybody thinking bout it reconsider it stressful long hours you'll forget about your life pays good money an benefits but naw
bad,Working at Tysons was an experience.The job i did not mind .i loved  the hours and benefits.Lots of perks.My management was great but showed favoritism to several people. OTHER co workers complain the whole time you are there. They act like you're not doing enough  even though you push yourself harder and  harder everyday. Its cut  throat they either like you or don't and if they don't they try to get you in trouble or constantly complaining out loud  making remarks or calling the superviser over to watch you. ONE guy in particular  Josh that's all he did all day complain step away from line and rest and watch everyone  else work. Which made it hard or they would purposely miss alot of shackles making you work harder then complain when you couldn't keep up.Have people  quit  all the time. I can see why now its not the job so much as the people. OVERALL  management was  good people. I feel they don't give you enough time to grow. LOTs of growing pains with the job.
bad,I work here currently because it pays the bills but I'am seeking employment anywhere else but here! In my department Management is not equipped with the tools to keep people around for the long haul. Favoritism is all I see day in and day out! I would rather work a simple lower paying job then deal with the people and management. Someone is always ready to throw you under the bus for a chance of advancement. Racial issue's in a place full of minority's. this place needs help and is always hiring because no one wants to stay. to take a pay cut to get away says it all so you all have been warned. at least in Amarillo Tyson PBX!
bad,I had great hours but they were taking so much out for union that I barely had a check. Very fast paced and challenging. Discounts on food and drinks.
bad,Es una empresa buena con buen ambiente para trabajar
bad,Management would never be around when needed machines would break and management would never call maintenance to come and fix problems. Most days you would get switched from one position to another position.
bad,It's good if you can stand working in cold temparatures . Average.You work with different meat  deparments and different types of meat.  Fast paced enviroment. you can work overtime .
bad,Never liked working there. Just tolerated for 15yrs. Couldn't trust management. Desire for advancement was always deterred by fear of chain of command
bad,"Good company, but ran poorly by people In power at that location. Great benefits, nice hourly wages. Management isn't worried about their job."
bad,I worked there and left to find another. Found another job but did not work out for me. But I'm glad they gave me the chance to come back and work for them.
bad,The job was good while it lasted. The employees were kind. I learned alot from Tyson. The hardest part was standing on my feet eight hours. I liked the coworkers.
bad,"standing and stacking boxes all day, didn't learn very much"
bad,"A typical day at Hillshire Brand, I get to work and go to a daily start-up/safety meeting, I go to my area and start sanitation support while they are still cleaning, After lines are released I set the line up for the product running that day, perform preventative maintenance and fix anything that may go down during preflight of lines. Continue to work on PM's and/or other projects during start-up. then if anything goes down make necessary corrections to keep the line running and keep down time to a minimum. "
bad,Wasn't any advancement but was steady work. Management didn't worry much about team members.
bad,"a typical day would start out by putting on your equipment such as mesh glove, hard hat, safty glasses, steel toe boots, clean apron and then some one will select your knife. I learn how to sharpen a knife with a sharpening steel. management would always be watching for bad cuts.co-workers never failed to be late too work and I would have to pull their count. the hardest part was when co-workers were late and took extra time in breaks."
bad,A typical day at work was making sure I was able to hang 40 chickens a minute onto shackles. I learned how chickens are really processed. Co-workers were very friendly and easy to get along with. The hardest part about this job was having an issue with a supervisor and going to management thinking it was tooken care of but wasn't. I enjoyed the cafeteria that was provided.
bad,Empresa excelente agradavel de trabalhar...
bad,"Management asks you to do tasks, but don't provide a way to do it. The plant is too small to achieve all the things they are trying to do. Everything is in the way in storage areas. Items needed for production are not provided in time from management when the process has already started."
bad,The Tyson foods company is a great company they prepare you for everything in the poultry industry. And assembly line  the associates there are very helpful and informing
bad,Went over and beyond my work duties and worked harder then my peers / co workers. Brought up unsafe workers and incidents and got fired for filming it because of lack of action from Chains of commands. But threatening to bring my lawyer into the mix and got my job back. Eventually resigned
bad,"Long Day on the clock. No help or restroom priveledges."
bad,"Short interview, need to take tour first in my opinion. Plant was clean and organized, Receptionist was nice. HR manager was friendly. The production floor environment was warm"
bad,"someone had taken my keys from where ever i had laid them down at and didn't turn them in. i had to leave my car up there for two whole days, when i had came back to receive my car someone had gotten in my car and drove it. i filed a police report but Tyson lied about having cameras outside so they couldn't see who stole my car. BAD FIRST COUPLE WEEKS!!!"
bad,"the places worst problem is bad management. management doesn't seem to care about workers and allow favorites to do what they want, there is no respect for the workers."
bad,The time I worked there I just needed a job.. it was easy to get in. I didn't like working in 40 degrees all day. My time her was better then Amazon for sure.
bad,I would get dressed clock in go to the floor to my bagging station and bag pumped pork product. you get a 15 minute break and 30 minute lunch. The management was very poor supervisor would get on your case for the littlest thing even if you didn't do anything wrong just because she didn't like you or had something against you. Hardest part about the job was dealing with the poor management.
bad,A typical day at Tyson was fast paced and steady. I learned to be quick and efficient. Management was caring and fair. The hardest part of the job was working with few workers.
bad,I have absolutely nothing good to say about this place. And I would not work here again if it's left to me. But it pays the bills for single people with no life.
bad,"I don't like that place, management only cares about numbers not there workers. maintenance gets blamed for most of the downtime. a lot of favoritism."
bad,the job was colder that I thought before starting on my first day and colder when I left on my last day the environment oat the plant left me wishing everyday for a different job
bad,"Tyson was a good experience for me, it made me realize that I will never work in live production ever again. From the mistreatment of the animals to the disrespect to the workers."
bad,good money very very cold work environment and very wet and slippery all sorts work hours never get off correct time your supposed to holiday and birthday pay
bad,I can only speak for the facility I worked at and not other Tyson locations. I was there when Tyson bought the plant and as Hudson Foods it was a great place to work that promoted team work. The managers that were brought in changed it to a cut throat place that was hard to go to everyday.
bad,A typical work night basically consist of doing what ever you are asked to do at the moment . I learned that some job titles are meaningless unless you are in the right position . I feel as if I was under poor management do to the fact of lack of help and not being organized . The workplace culture is diverse . The hardest part of my job was getting my team members to work as a team . The most enjoyable part of my job was receiving certain benefits .
bad,Esta muy bien el trabajo es facil todos muy amables
bad,Supervision will not stand up for their employees it's every man for themselves. If a situation with your family or children  should arise don't worry Tyson will point you no matter what you have goin on.
bad,yes tysons aint a bad job if you like the cold and the wet when u get there you put on a water proof lab coat safety googles and ear plugs it is extreamly loud in there  you get two brakes and a lunch i learned how to hng chickens on a hook and the mangement is very good to you there the hardest part about working there is how cold it is and how wet it is and the smell is very bad and the only part that i liked about it was when i was abel to go home not my type of work
bad,The managers and employees are helpful. They are easy to get along with. Was told several different things in the interviews that did not line up with what really occurred when hired.
bad,Very large incorporation that provides tons of jobs. Teaches work ethic and provides good benefits for its employees. The turn over rate was 34.34% in 2014 when I was employed there. It's a job that opens you up to many cultures as there is globalization in this industry.
bad,"A typical day at work was really, really cold. In my case it was cold and eventful. I learned a few things working at Tyson. Management was nice, and everyone was respectful. The workplace culture could be identified as diverse. I meant a lot of different people of a lot of different races. The hardest part of the job to me was having to deal with the cold. It was not even so much as my body being cold, it was my hands that I couldn't keep warm. The most enjoyable part of the job was the cafeteria. They made some of the best breakfast and lunch. I absolutely loved it."
bad,it was ok working their really not the best place i worked way to much overtime they had to be done not organized was clean just some times a mess
bad,good company to work for also good people. Dealing with HACCP you learn a lot about safety and quality. coworker are good to work with. The hardest part of the job is making sure nothing leaves the plant unsafe. The most enjoyable part of the job is learning from USDA.
bad,The pay ever week is ok but you just got to get use to the people. Some people act like their in high school the way they act. so places it cold some are hot but overall a descent place to work.
bad,"I did not enjoy working here at all. I was young when I was working here, so they only gave me a few hours to work a week. When I got older they still did not increase my hours."
bad,Honestly I hated working at Tysons my hands and arms hurt so bad every night. It was good money and you had Holidays and weekends off.
bad,All supervisor have good planing and pretty good qualities.I can say that they encourage all worker and the company improvement .I don't have any problem a bout this job but the most enjoyment part is cone line.
bad,"por lo general es mas trabajo de  producción, se puede aprender de trabajos mecánicos, lo mas difícil es soportar los fuertes olores que produce el gas H2s."
bad,Good place to learn very tough environment. If you can last there you can  last anywhere.
bad,"Don't remember much about it, except that it was really hot from all the ovens. I did not know to many people because we was in a separate area from others call the pan room. had to make sure that everything was cleaned and ready to go."
bad,After you have worked at tyson foods for a while your just not making any money.
bad,"On a normal day I would go in and see what machines are down or what has broken. troubleshoot the problems and repair, could be working on anything from hydraulics, pneumatic, mechanical also did all electrical work from Motor Control Centers to PLC's. Did all the plant electrical troubleshooting."
bad,i worked her  for  summer  seasons and  i was  making  good  money and  getting to  know how  floor  processing works and   indeed i  got  experience  doing this job
bad,I can not say anything bad about this company it helped to pay my bills until something else had came along
bad,tyson was a great company due to cutbacks and union rules dept. downsized and i was a casulty
bad,"Job not hard, Management is not that good at hiring supervisors because they are not shown how to run machines and  some are not trained be a leader, there is a lack of communication within this facility."
bad,proceessing different kinds of meats. My co workers and I got along great.
bad,I work for tyson for 18 years; that was my lively hood. I was fired for job performance according to the new asst. plant manager who is now the plant manager. The hardest part of the job is getting use to the costant shift in bosses; in the past year they have had 3 plant managers.in the past 18 years i have grown and bonded with many people creating a warm and family atmosphere. WE have had managers move here to work and left in 3 days or less. they have said that they never seen a plant ran like this. broken bow ok needs help
bad,Working at Tyson is a good place to work only if you enjoy being pushed over by management. They work you senseless and management dony even help with personal issues even if your the victim of anything that happens there.
bad,"We had to work ever Saturday starting around October until about April.  Sometimes we would go in and people would be sent home as soon as we clocked in because there wasn't enough work.  It made it hard to spend time with my kids because I worked 2nd shift, and every Saturday."
bad,"While Tysons has helped my family by providing family with jobs, it personally wasnt for me. The jobs are gross and not for those with weak stomachs. The lines paces are incredibly aggressive and dont allow for breathing room unless you have already been there for a few decades, in which your whole body has already become used to the putrid scents and muscle spasms. It is not for everyone and for those who can handle it, i salute you."
bad,"Well maybe my 4 years of working there, I learned that they only concerned is the chicken. I learned that hard work doesn’t gets recognized . It’s a good job for somebody who is a felon are on probation but other then that it’s not."
bad,I was nervous about working here overall because when you walk through there all you see is dead pigs and blood. It was something to get used to and for sure not a job choice for everyone.
bad,"Performing job task, learned that working alone is awesome, management is not up to speed (they prefer not to stay on their line NOTE two set of eyes are better than one), the workplace is not bad it's just some teammembers that make it hard for those that care, the hardest part of my job is walking (now there are Quality Technicians on the floor - one on each line that is authorized to issue a deficiency to a line supervisor but refuse / they claim it's not their job but I rather they address the issue and not wait I'm one person), the most enjoyable part of my job is my thirty minute break."
bad,"a typical day at work you cut shoudlers and wings all day long. you only get two 30min breaks. You will be hyrting extremely bad. And if you go to the nurse, the nurses will cop and adittude  and tell you lies about what happened to you. The hardest job about the job is dealing with the pain you have to get doing all the work."
bad,Tyson is a good job that make good money. It not the work place the bad thang about it is how it ran.To work at tyson u got to be able to work jux about 10 hours a day.
bad,"Tyson is okay to work for. The plant in my area is the only available decent waged employment. Not much room for advancement, but it does pay the bills."
bad,"Go into the locker rooms when you arrive, put on your metal apron and plastic apron, and your belt and hat, gloves and earplugs, you sharpen knives constantly all day,  to achieve your main goal which is trimming the gullet from the cow tounge."
bad,"Fast-paced at moments...then at other times very slow-motion...then the constant strain, wear and tear on the body. All while being in freezing temperatures. Constant travel up and down a flight of stairs. Unloading and loading product on 1 elevator for 5 lines. Constant clutter of objects and people in the way."
bad,"Walking into Tyson Foods is very depressing. Everything is fast paced, boring, competitive, and not human like. CO workers are awesome to talk to. Break time is long enough."
bad,Poor management as well as floors and equipment never getting fixed in a timely fashion. I drive in negative 10 degrees for 8 hours a day sometimes 7 days a week.
bad,Need new equipment. The equipment need to be replaced. management need to be better far as attitude and respect for the satff. and need more staff
bad,I had lots of trouble with other employees and harassment issues. Management was helpful with assisting with teaching and job advancement
bad,this place was another good place to work however it paid less and at this the time the hours you worked for the money you were making was not all of that I feel if I would have been getting paid at least 11 dollars an hour I would have felt better about this work I did learn how to properly load a truck because you can not have a truck off balance it could fall over on your family or anyone else family with that being said overall I enjoyed the work just not the pay reason for leaving serious family problems
bad,"not a fun place to work but if you need a paycheck he pay is not that bad, gets really cold inside so dress appropriate for the temperature in attire not to binding, room for advancement, just make sure you really need a job"
bad,The company makes so much money to pay people a lot more for what they pay the work is to the extreme.Also very cold and wet nasty raw meat every were the hold 9hr you working all the breaks together only 40m..
bad,i have good experience working at Tyson that's the reason i try to coming back I have good day and bad day working rish is every other place you work its always bad and good day that is mornal to me thanks
bad,I had to work there because I have responsibilities but then I got to frustrate D with the work and the traveling that I had to look for something different.
bad,Good people good franchise to be apart of with awesome benefits. It is the true definition of advanced franchise each and everyday you have employees competing to get to that next level.
bad,The work place was ok the work at. The bathrooms could be attended to. The employees are not respectful. This would be the last place I would offer anyone to go to
bad,doing other peoples jobs for them when they wasnt trained how to operate the machines.
bad,"I work third shift, in which, the lines go down and have to be cleaned and then set back up to run again. My co-workers have no sense of team work and do not care about the lines that are running and the down-time they endure. All they want to do is set-up and tear-down. They have no interest in learning the packaging equipment, check weighters, x-ray machines, or other food safety equipment in the area. We have a high turn over rate in my area. The only thing I like about the job is the benefits."
bad,Overall good place to work just don’t get hurt that they will fire you unsafe workplace good pay good benefits hard work fast paced factory set environment
bad,I felt that they cared more about there products then there employees and to get a problem solved threw management was like finding a needle out a a hay stack
bad,"Most f the time you would hate to go in there the Supervisers where not  very nice to people and that named it where people didn't want to talk to each other the leads where mean as well if you asked to go to the restroom the lead didn't want to let you ,people always talk about other people ,it just isn't A good place to work"
bad,Tyson  I loved to operate FORKLIFTS at Tyson it was a alright  job if you could over look managers an things they had going I was alright because i just stayed to my self an did my work
bad,It was a nice work place. I felt safe and comfortable. The trainers a nice and very helpful. the work hours were ok. the machines where always clean. the only thing about it all is that it cold.
bad,Its not a bad job as long as you can stand on your feet hours on end. Also you have to deal with cold and not getting much time after work with family depending on wich shift .
bad,"very long and hard."
bad,Trainers are great. Help you understand the easiest way to learn your job.
bad,lo que aprendi hay fue a cortar en piezas el pollo y estivar tambien aprendi a ser basculista
bad,"To start our day off we do our exercises."
good,"I didn't like the employee everyone there speak Spanish and 100 percentage are Mexican from the border they weren't nice and doesn't understand English"
good,always mandated for at least 48 hours with minimal raises. alos little chance for a home life as we usually work 48 or more hours weekly. very small upswing
good,Trabalho bom e fácil
good,"Since Tyson took over it ruined the culture, became a micromanaged environment that even they couldn't keep up with - they took a perfectly well run company, ground it up and spit it out.  They could never make it work so they sold it at a loss."
good,I loved working here. I love fast paced work and this was a fun job. Yes it is repetitive but each product is very different and its was awesome to learn how the different products are made.
good,"My job was eliminated after 20 years on the job."
good,Some days are ok and others days things seem to just go wrong. some co workers are nice. others are not. Its somewhere to work if you just need the money. Ive learned a few things while working here but its not a place where I see myself staying and the pay could be better than what it is.
good,I was recently let go due to poor probational period performace. I was still in my prob period when they did my exit review early. I was in the union and they did absolutely nothing about it.
good,Typical  day at Tyson  shift  starts at  7 so i be there around 6 or  630   to get  my reports  of how much  chicken  would be coming in to are area  how many  pallets  we  need to make  that day . and  i would make sure  to help  the other workers and get  supplies as they need them .I actually really enjoyed  working with people helping them .to be honest  i really enjoyed my  job  anyone will tell you noel plant  is the hardest plant to work for regardless of that  the people  you work with  make it worth it .
good,This was a decent job that would pay the bills.  If you can handle the cold enviroment and not bothered by the chicken blood and constant wet no a bad job.
good,"answer calls for break downs is what made up most days , you learned what you could from your co-workers. management has lack of communication with workers. The workers was good people to work with and hardest part of the job is getting no backup from management."
good,That plant does not want anyone outside of their social circle to advance. If you did not act or speak the way they wanted they targeted you. Good insurance
good,"Its stressful, loud and very unaccomadating to anyone with a mental disability unless you jump through many hoops. Overall, it is good money and if you can handle it, and dont mind only 1 free day per week, its fine"
good,Job pays good but management is terrible. Everyday we are told how bad we did the previous day when 75 percent of the people on the shift are new hires with less than 90 days of employment there. Also the supervisor leaves early all the time
good,"very stressful and fast paced, very political environment, afraid some one would get a couple minutes rest but would short your breaks with no compensation. Use Threats to try to get more than your share of work."
good,They work too much. You have no time for your family and when you are off you are too tired to enjoy your time off. Its very cold and you will hurt after each day
good,"they are very disorganized "
good,This occupation has its flaws to be worried about there production over there employees. But its all for a good reason for retailers and wholesalers can have foods.
good,"October 2011 to August 2013				Godrej Tyson Foods Ltd"
good,i would star at2:30 with inventory then help with shipping at 930 go to scale tell 530
good,"I worked for Tyson Food for 20 years at the end of my 20 years I made $12.85.. the best thing about Tyson Foods is the  Stock Program ,retirement program and you get your birthday off as a holiday..."
good,"Rough environment, cut throat, poorly managed. High turnover, both salaried and hourly. Poor involvement from corporate. Average pay and pretty good benefits."
good,"Tyson.. not the best place to work. It’s cold and there’s a lot of mandatory overtime. If you have kids, you won’t see them much. There’s a lot of turn over."
good,It’s not a fun place to work it’s a place for someone has family. Because they will get rid of you an you will lose  your job that’s what I don’t like about it
good,Lots of favoritism and promotions for employees that had terrible work habits.  Hired new employees in at higher pay than current employees with the same job title and responsibilities.
good,Tyson pays good but they do not care about there employees. The upper management is about there bonuses why the employees do the hard work and they get the bonuses.
good,working on the line with people. How to get long with people.  How hard it was to manage my time with all the hours I worked. Very Stressful.Getting along with people I do not like. Leaving at the end of the day.
good,Hardest part was that I learned how to do everything as fast as I could  nd after I could run whole line I asked for raise nd I was told to hold on only to give me .50cent raise when I was doing my leads job .
good,Would not return. They are more about the company then any thing eles. i spent more time at work then home and they dont give weekend off to anyone...
good,My position had 4 departments of billing and only had 2 night personnel in contrast to the 5 day personnel. With 4 departments came 4 supervisors. So no clear structure of importance except when it came to deadlines.
good,"I didn't mind working, but some of the supervisors were a**holes. Some of them act untouchable and would talk smack to the workers. I understand that they are supervisor/manager, but that's not how you treat your employees."
good,Go in at 6 in the morning. work hard all day with a 30-45 min break. Treat you like nothing you doing is ever good enough. This was a really difficult place to work at. The people was rude to each other all the time. But its a job for the most. They really don't fire you. You fire yourself.
good,"Sometimes overworked and under paid. Depending on what department you work you can be in the climate, the cold, or the heat, weekly pay is a plus, but overall you have to earn every cent you make"
good,Pushed me to take a supervisor position and then treated me poorly. Did not get the proper training for the job. They wouldnt allow me to go back to the line.
good,"But he didn't promote within, and he did not pay well at all for the job you did. But if you needed to work, he would work you. He took away your overtime by useing you at 1 of 4 stores. so you didnt get too many hours."
good,"There are great employees who work there, and will put forth their best efforts for management who cares about their well being."
good,Proceed with caution. Long days; undue stress levels; politics rule over performance; no work life balance; unpredictable schedules and work hours.
good,"there is alot of drama there, if you are the low one there then you will not get anywhere and it seems only certain people get ahead."
good,people here are okay to deal with on a day to day basis you do your job and go home
good,"At Tyson Foods I worked as a stocker, ensuring that all shelves were stocked and ready for consumers.  My co-workers were friendly and ready to help each other when necessary."
good,"Hard Laborer"
good,"Easy fast pace loving day, learning more and more in that type of business every day , every hour.The hardest part of the job is loading and unloading your work truck.The most enjoyable part of the day is when you know your at your last store and you know your just about done ,but usually that last store takes for ever."
good,"It's a blessing to have a job, but management has things so screwed up most of the employees are fed up with the way the plant is ran.  Many employees are getting laid off and everyone is concerned about their future with the company.  The hardest part of the my job is the physical and hard work being put in and not enough gratitude for what we do on a daily basis."
good,I loaded chickens that were placed in cages from four houses or more. Management was horrable workers were hard working. It was hard to deal with the heat and the 16+ hour days. Going home was great.
good,"The company in kentucky pays less than all others across the country just about every week I had to have my check corrected for being shorted, the union there is under thumb by the company and has no real fight for the workers."
good,"Fast paced work environment, overall not a bad job if you dont mind the environment smelling and dont mind letting yourself be treated poorly by supervisors etc."
good,I recommend going there because of their great training program! I was able to learn a lot from the team members and felt like the company itself was very focused on safety
good,"Over the past several years, non-management office staff were given more and more tasks to do.  The number of new employees increased by 20% within the facility where I worked.  There wasn't enough time to get all jobs completed, at least accurately.  The stress of the jobs can get to a person in this environment."
good,Our team works as a family which is good because there is no time for family outside of work.. Mandatory overtime six days a week gets old. Working environment can be enjoyable but cold. Pay is fair for the work that you do.
good,I loved it it was great very understanding and caring staff! they were very understanding in family crisis that was very devastating to me and my family.
good,supervisors and management make the work place stressful and do not take care of their employees as stated in orientation. only good thing is the pay and benifits
good,Manager was not to be found when you needed her.  Manager was not a resource person.  Policies seemed to change as desired and company policy was not always followed by manager.
good,Working here is tough.   The time you are there its hard to make it to kids programs dr apps.   And all around hard to schedule a day off.   Very stressful environment
good,there was no part of the job was hard  it was very lay back and easy to learned the job what i learned about this job is the to learned to work as a team
good,"Extremely cold and wet, hard work, short breaks by time you take off all safety gear an walk from building to parking lot your break is over. Standing in one spot on concrete for long periods of time with out a break."
good,"Tyson is a great company to work for. Its a place that you have to go to work, do your job, and go home. The company has great benefits but will try to avoid letting you use them if possible. There is a lot of favoritism shown at the Hope location."
good,"Very long hours, little English speaking, very hot during summer, would leave work soaked in sweat due to wearing suits in 110 degree weather with no air conditioning."
good,working at Tyson you have no life it is a better job for a single person with no children that likes to work 6-7 days a week. other than that its a ok place to work
good,"Challenging and sometimes complex work environment, But overall a rewarding experience. Sometimes work requirements can be overbearing but the work load is always completed."
good,Worked a lot of overtime. Always hiring new people. Didn't promote as should have within the company. Pull chicken guts or grade chicken feet or check chickens.
good,"Their is a huge lack of respect for employers at tyson foods. My department is the most worked department in the building, but we are not appreciated. We are over worked and for the hours we take on, under paid."
good,I personally did not like the jobcold had to whear hair nets even though I don't have hair  fast pace and no jewelry no personal items can't eat down there just passed out and work work work work if you don't forget on you
good,"Tyson Foods, Inc. is an amazing company but with its recent restructure, it is slowly losing it's culture of uplifting and encouraging others with Talent Development hiring and recruiting people outside the company for promotional positions."
good,This job requires you to move and bend. This job will affect your body over period of time and sometimes permanently. There are standards set for departments you work in.
good,Good things and difficult things like any job.  A lot of good hard working people make up the foundation of this company.  Some new and exciting things are coming in the future.
good,hours were good pay way not management was ok the job was not hard enjoyed the people did not like the cold the a lot of standing and using hands very fast pace
good,The job was not difficult but my immediate supervisor was.  My days were numbered and it was obvious.
good,The job was very fast paced and required a lot of multitasking. I operated several machines and once given a task I could complete without being supervised.
good,Good Place to work but only if you can change the management..
good,I enjoyed some of the people who worked there but I felt they were a little racist as I was one of a few white people there. We have to stand all day with only 2 10 min breaks and a 45 min lunch break. We would have to work late most nights and also saturdays
good,Work in -8 degrees with a freezer suit. Learned I'm not able to move very well in a huge freezer suit in such cold weather. Management was poor. Co-workers were alright. Hardest part was everything. Most enjoyed was learning to use a forklift in cold icy conditions.
good,"evry early start to the day generally 10-12 hr days, great relationship with co-workers and customers. middle management great to work with fairly cooperative. upper management clueless. hardest part of the job was the physical labor. loved being out with the customers away from any offices."
good,cool co-workers
good,Fairly Ok work . the company didnt adhere to certain holidays. the company also wasnt allowing employees to take time off for personal days .
good,"Workplace harassment is high at Tyson, broken promises, too many Saturday workdays. Management is more concerned with the products than the employees."
good,You have good people who love that job and it good place just long hours and long night that suck frfr the money is ok not all of that could be more but anyway it a ok job for star out
good,"Good place to start your first company job if you can handle fast moving line.. but can be dizzy afterwards. The training process was nice, but on the line is very difficult."
good,If you can stand on cement for 8 or more hours a day in a freezer. The job is an assembly line for frozen breakfast sandwiches. You will be working in a diverse group of people. Meaning most people there speak another language. Dont drop your stuff even though there security. They wont find your belongings if you misplace anything.
good,I worked for Tyson’s over a period of 34 years. I seen a lot of changes first hand but the worst was political. I ended up making a team member upset with me and he did everything he could to get me fired and ultimately did. Management is out the window and they don’t truthfully stand behind their policies unless they are called on the carpet.
good,Most enjoyable part of job was working with others and making a safe work place. Satisfied at the end of the day knowing i was a good employee...i enjoyed learning new things and being challenged everyday troubleshooting machinery is the most enjoyable part of my job
good,The management was awful. They had their favorites and I was the only female on my shift so it was awful. Lot of other ppl on the other crows were good. The HR team was awful. I wouldnt recommend working there. But if u can overlook management the pay is greqt
good,Ok place to work long hours as a picker 12 hours everyday. Team work is not present but sometimes is. Diverse working atmosphere with ethnicity from all over.
good,"Tyson is a fun place to work but management should take their employees more seriously. If we come to a supervisor and express our concerns with working with another employee the supervisors should at least try to work with us instead of listing it as drama. Tyson should value their management support and tech support more honestly I’d rather be a plain hourly tm with benefits, incentives, and a bigger point scale."
good,"They hire people fast and the pay is good,  But the working conditions are harsh.   and certain Working supplies are limited to certain workers.  Also rules and regulations vary on the people."
good,"16 hours days/nights. Short staffing every day. Teamwork and loyalty were non existent."
good,"Fast pace environment and the line cannot be down for more than 15 mins. The head maintenance does not want to spend money on spare parts. Parts department very unorganized. CMMS was ok but the supervisor does take the time to look it over. Parts always duplicate due to lack of communication through CMMS portal. Maintenance training is a joke, unless your are a newbie. Then it should help you out in the learning process. The management teams could be better!"
good,They honestly don’t care about you. I had a kid and missed 4 days of work and still got pointed. Upper management doesn’t care one bit about any issue you may have they expect it to go perfectly while they sit in there office and make personal calls.
good,work for this company is ok....but the management team needs improvement overall tyson is a great company to work for. on the daily basis i would be in charge of twelve people that work with me. to get sale orders put in a timely fashion.
good,"Buddy System gets you anywhere at Albertville tyson maintenance. As long as you have a personal relationship you will grow. If you do your job, and stay to t"
good,"Tyson was easy work, but working 7 days a week did t work with my family. They don’t allow doctors notes, so even if you’re sick you better hope you are off more than 5 days and have FMLA or LOA. Poor management. HR sucks! I would not recommend working here."
good,"Team lead should be less involved in the tyson gossip and supervisors should do more supervising. Its a easy job, however the costant talking behind everybody back is stressful to listen to day after day"
good,Rain sleet snow hail come to work or get fired get hurt or sick get fired they care more about chicken then workers and their wellfare wouldnt recommend to a friend at all its a job
good,Takes a toll on your feet and back it kills your hands nine time out of ten you’ll end up with  carpal tunnel syndrome co workers couldn’t hold conversation becymost were foreign
good,Poor work morale... Inept exicution by transportation management.... Unless you live in Arkansas you are desciminated on available loads... Only good thing is their benefits package... Have worked for them going on 14yrs and per my personal experiences the longer your employed as a driver the worse you are treated... I have watched as their senior drivers are leaving the company due to the horrible load planners and dispatch of loads.
good,It was an okay job but was tough hours. The hours were not set so you came in at different times every day which is kind of hard to do because you can’t get a routine down.
good,They payed good money but alot of hours. A racist environment had an hispanic ask a white why they worked there... they said they shouldnt work there because they are white. Favors the spanish over english. They hire everyone and anyone they can.
good,"If you like the drama that's always going on there, then it's a place for you. I like the every week pay so I work their because that's how I take care of my family."
good,conditions are as expected for the industry.   Compensation to employees  could be improved.   A very diverse place of employment.  Advancement seems limited
good,Not ment For A person with Family The hours dont add up they tell you one thing an do another this work place have favorites and you will see it. And they talk to you with no respect and will try to get over on you.
good,the workplace is very dirty and can be dangerous. managers ask too much. left relying on co-workers to keep plant working. can go days with no work and left to sit around with nothing to do.
good,"Department Manager had terrible managerial skills and horrible temperament, and therefore, the department had a high turnover rate. Manager believed in screaming and humiliating plant managers in front of their peers in a full auditorium."
good,"I was hired for full time and only got to work 20-30 hrs if that each week that is not full time hrs, i only worked one week for 40 hrs in the 7 months i was there. so i had to quit due to family issues and not sure if i wanted to go back, probably not since that was my second time working there and the first time which was years before this time i still didn't get 40 hrs then either."
good,"It wasn't my type of thing for work. But definitely not a bad company to work for. The pay can be good, plus benefits. If you don't mind working in cold temperatures this would work out for you."
good,"It is a harsh environment, depending on your supervisor it can be relaxed or extremely stressful . You are under constant pressure to meet production. People are not important."
good,"Managers were extremely unprofessional and it felt like being at a large highschool. Not a great work environment, supervisors ignore problems and leads dont lead."
good,During my time at a management level within the company I worked overtime every week.  I averaged 50 hours a week.  My VP expected everyone to work overtime and did not any appreciation for it.  For internal audit travel was over weekends and all through the week and audit work was often during the overnight hours.  The audit VP was difficult to work for and did not show appreciation for the time away from home.  The work environment in audit was very political and there was extreme favoritism on the part of the directors and audit vp.  If you work for Tyson expect to work a lot of overtime.
good,"Performed physical and visual inspections of products and plan systems; documented calculated results of inspection accurately; took corrective action when necessary; alert appropriate personnel to adjust processes; identified, segregate and isolated nonconforming product and reported the results to management; maintained warehouse facilities; updated and maintained quality control and warehouse records and reports."
good,"Tyson food,is an good job for first time employees looking for an job that pays weekly,with many different positions to try,an move around trying,different positions,to learn new job skillls"
good,"I started work there 5 years and supervisors don't listen to employee they make up ways to fire you and you have to be able to deal with gossip and ignore it, the best thing to do to stay along time is don't socialize with the employees but listen to them when it comes to your safety"
good,"Worked there for 2* years. Things never got better only worse. The upper management does not care about their staff, supervisors included."
good,"My day is different every day. It just depends on how everything is running on what I have to do. I have learned a lot about industrial maintenance in my almost 6 years here and I started knowing absolutely nothing about wastewater and I now have my Missouri Class B Certification. As far as management goes, well everyone has their own opinion about that. My co -workers are great. we try to make everything we do fun so we can look forward to the next day. The hardest part of my job is that we are short handed and so there is never enough time to get everything done."
good,"I work in Human Resources.  It is very busy."
good,Fast paced work environment with multitasking an essential asset. Challenging due to language barriers with the team members.
good,"I got great work experience there."
good,"I didn't like working at Tyson Foods. The management was unorganized, people would go off of hearsay in regards to when we would work or not, first they were ooverworking us 7days a week to cutting hours down to 24-32 hours a week."
good,"Tyson Foods Inc isn't a horrible place to work while at the same time it's not the greatest. In my particular career field we seem to be overlooked or looked upon as second class citizens."
good,I begin reviewing 2nd shift supervisor notes and spending reports. Attend many improvement meetings throughout the day. I am constantly learning more about mechanical engineering. I have a great support staff that keeps me informed. Not understanding some of the electrical components of our equipment is the hardest part of my job. The best part is helping the operations group with their process from knowledge gained in my previous positions.
good,"On an average day I would do inventory on hundreds of materials, as well as receiving new materials in. Hardest part of the job was dealing with non-communication from upper management. The most enjoyable part of this job was my co-workers."
good,"a typical day is long and cold. Since I worked on the shift where all the new people came in there was constant mistakes. I learned to like the 3 days on a"
good,"The tension between members of management and their respective team members is very high. My view of my job was that I was responsible for keeping my area running as smoothly as possible each week with the resources at hand, but I was informed point blank that I should be more interested in covering my butt. This leads me to the opinion that, rather than finding solutions the problems faced management was more interested in finding specific team members to blame for said problems, leaving solutions at a secondary value level. This type of attitude creates a hostile, almost volatile work environment and not at all conducive to a healthy work relationship with hourly team members."
good,"a very fast paced environment, i loved working with everyone. the most enjoyable part was making new friends"
good,Its a good job for a short amount of time. The supervisors only care about themselves and only care about numbers.
good,"A typical day required clocking in with a badge sometimes 10 to 15 earlier. Getting ready (wear protective wear that cover you from the chicken), then fixing the machines to make them run again, then waiting till they breakdown. Good amount of idletime however when its time to work to be scared if a supervisor starts hollering out of no where trying to investigate why the line is down. Most of the time they dont disrespect and treat you like a child. Second shift has the worst schedule ending at 2-3am on a friday and starting again at 6-9am (i found is very demanding and almost military-like schedule). They took almost 5 weeks to pay me the shift diff. Took HR forever to get information that shouldve been immediately tended. Work isnt all that hard but some people your just going to have to handle and take like a grain of salt. Lots of snitches not towards myself but inbetween most. Lot of unfairness but that just standard in most planes of reality or perception."
good,good pay but not enough to compensate for managment and time spent at work.
good,I love the environment!!! The employees are friendly and pleasant to work with. The managers walk around to get familiar with employees to assist and solve problems.
good,"A Empresa precisa avaliar seus Diretores, Gerentes e Supervisores, pois muitos deles não estão capacitados para exerce o cargo que ocupa. O Supervisor Geral de RH que fica em Curitiba é um exemplo claro de falta de conhecimento."
good,"Meus dias de trabalho eram como qualquer outro em qualquer empresa, afinal gosto de trabalhar, me interesso por coisas novas, novos desafios, aprendi principalmente ali a me valorizar mais, por isso o fao de pedir para sair da empresa, a direção é muito boa, a gerencia há falhas, é só aprenderem a dar ouvidos a opiniões que as coisas podem funcionar bem melhor, meus colegas em meu setor não tenho do que me queixar. A parte mais dificil não existe quando se tem persistencia e força de vontade, a parte mais agradavel é o trabalhar, ser util e poder contribuir para o crscimento desta ou de qualquer outra empresa."
good,"My job in the chicken process plant  to keep  everything cool.  that why I went to school some 25 years ago.  I felt I was not as mechanical as I should me."
good,I learned a lot with the company.  Tyson promotes diversity but it is difficult to promote.
good,Long work days with no lunch breaks you get two 15 min breaks in that time you can not leave the premises of Tyson Foods. Every time you have a vacation day expect to work that weekend or the one after.
good,"A days of work really easy and time really goes by fast. Other employees easy to work with and around. Get along with everyone and supervisors. The hardest part of the job would be the little lunch break. The most enjoyable part would be payday, bills getting paid."
good,"During my 1 and half years with Tyson, I felt very different things. I was told many times that Tyson is in the business of making money and the employees that did not want to make money or help Tyson make money should leave. The particular branch I worked for needs some major reconstruction in the management department. I understand the need of making money, but we are not slaves. We are humans and we deserve to be treated as thus. They treated us like we were just their worker bees in a hive fully of other worker bees. We worked in very cold condition and were constantly sick. The repetitive movements cause many, myself included, to develop carpal tunnel or other hand disabilities. However, when we went to see a doctor or were sent to a doctor Tyson wanted to throw a fit. Many people were terminated due to their doctor visits, which could be one reason this particular branch had such a high turnover rate. I will admit that I learned a lot during my time there. I worked in Whole Leg Debone, and started as a trimmer, with scissors which were dull most of the time. I eventually worked my way up to a saw operator, then became a novice scorer, and finally a line feeder. I was able to do every job on the line. This is partially due to myself and partially my line lead, who is now a supervisor. My coworkers, as in my linemates, were hard workers, for the most part. My line was part of a experimental line where we got rid of the trimmers and the saw operators accomplished their usual jobs and then the duties of the trimmer. This type of line called for 6 saw operators, and we were"
good,The management could use some help and the employees need to learn English.
good,"Tyson Fresh Meats says they have these good values and ethics. However most of management doesn't practice them.. not everyone is treated equally. They tend to over work their employers to the point of injury, then get mad at them if they have to be placed on light duty due to an injury."
good,Work to many hours some times 28 hes straight at salary 😫 no holidays some times 7 days a week ........................ .............................
good,"Management is poor and"
good,I believe certain locations are great to work for but I would not encourage anyone to pursue employment at Mexican Original especially in maintenance management.
good,No evidence of reasoning behind termination. Accused me of kicking a +200lb door an needing repair. When escorted to collect personal items door operated properly with out error.
good,"I didnt really care for the job because I was barely helped and there were no benefits to help. I also never got paid for overtime. Pretty much, Tysons was just a job I needed at the time."
good,Good money but 7 days a week with no break and no family life.supervisors care nothing about there employees.only certain ones can get days off.dont recommend working there on maintenance you don't have a family life.
good,"We have to work 9 hour shifts, 6 days a week, from August until March. Your whole life is consumed by this place. I definitely wouldn’t recommend it to anyone with a family. The pay is good, but the wear on your body is rough."
good,Love the job. Good job to make $20+ an hour. Only way to lose the job is if you dont come to work. They give us Turkey & Hams this year. Lots of money to make during the summer.
good,"Tyson Foods, is an ok place to drive. I was hired into AR shuttle which was a very easy home every day job. For around a year and two months after being hired in, I worked my tail end off for the company and my fleet manager even going as far as to work countless Saturdays (which are not required). Since you are home every day with shuttle, they adhere to a pretty strict attendance policy. I at most missed three days in a year and two of which weren't counted against me due to truck breakdowns and not being able to get a proper break in before going back to work. All I can say is DO NOT violate ANY company policies!! Because they will pick and choose and not be consistent with the punishment. I was fired for ""sabotage/unintended use"" of company equipment which can be punishable as a written warning/suspension or they can go to the max and terminate you. The part where they are inconsistent is, I shared the day cab with another driver who had an accident and tore up the fender backing into a pole. He failed to report this accident due to not wanting to get in trouble. This is also gross misconduct, a terminable offense. He was only charged with a preventable accident and 4 points against his safety record. So you have a guy that misses work left and right, doesn't go above and beyond for his company, tears up company equipment and doesn't report it, and keeps his job and then someone like me who gets fired for unplugging a cable. And forget trying to point out these inconsistencies to your fleet manager or the Associate Director of Transportation. They don't want to hear it!!!"
good,"It's somewhat laid back in shipping, but they provide no training past driving a forklift. it pays decent for this area, but I feel like I want to make more money."
good,"Enjoyed the work task list, but management was in a hurry to write anyone up if they could not find them. I had boiler room, roof AC and Exhaust fan, classroom training, and if they did not find me in the boiler room because I was on the roof, They would write me up, I got tired of being written up and quit."
good,Work more saturdays than off. Was not told this in the interview. Management structure is not strong. Have had issues with benefits trying to deal with my maternity leave. Definitely not satisfied with the company.
good,"Tyson foods is a good job, management could do way better and the hours are crazy . I learned how to drive the trucks and put them in the dock doors. The job was easy but working everyday is crazy"
good,I never had a problem with my job I loved doing the work at Tyson Distribution Center in Rogers the problem was the management. As a woman I was continuously harassed and when I would report it they did nothing. Then when i didn't report it because they did nothing I was reprimanded. In any situation management took the mans side whether he was right or wrong. I was forced to wear a freezer suit for men that did not fit me and keep me warm and I am a curvy woman they refused to provide me a freezer suit that fit me properly which was a violation of federal regulation since it was necessary ppe for my job. In the end I had to buy my own freezer suit  and gloves.  Management and Quality control do nothing to monitor the safety of the food that is in damaged cases that are repaired and sold to employees and donated to local food banks. I often checked pallets from other shifts that were to go into the sales and there could be between 5 to 30 cases on a pallet that had not been checked for hold to make sure it was safe to sell to employees or donate and supervisors and plant management knew about this because i reported it to them regularly and they did nothing about it. Major favoritism going on. I and two other guys had been there for years and wanted to learn a new job but instead they took some one who had only been there a year and taught him the job because his cousin was a shift manager. Also management will tell you to do things that violate safety regulations and then if you get caught doing what they told you to do they act as if they knew nothing and then reprimand you
good,"Management was a joke. in the year i worked there, my department went threw 5 supervisors. some people goofed off when ever they wanted and others were written up for dumbest of things."
good,"The Job is not to bad, but they have a high turn over rate and cut hours. The management micromanaged a lot. They do hire felons and they do rehire. The job is ok just need to care about the people more and pay more. They will overwork u. No work/life balance."
good,"Tyson Foods will promote from within as long as your supervisor will help you get the training you will need on different software that is used, for example, SAP. My supervisor has stopped my advancement in the company by not making this training available to me."
good,work isn't that hard you just have to learn you own flow about how to get the job done. when working the job you have to make sure that if you don't know what your doing that you ask questions on how to do things the right way
good,"You can meet people and make friends, or you can just come to work and do your job but its a physical and hard working job. You also have to make sure that your doing what you suppose to do and not listening to other team members."
good,"On a typical day there isn't much downtime which I didn't mind. I moved into a position that I like alot. I had an impeccable disciplinary report but was let go because management said I wasn't doing my job well. I went to school for this job and completed all of my training while working full time and maintained on the Deans list, pretty sure management was to blame for my job loss."
good,Tyson is a good company but I am looking for an opportunity to interact with a team in a different environment. I enjoy interacting with different people and being in an environment that is not a meat processing production.
good,Okay place to work. They don't want to pay you squat. People in the factory were overworked. They are more worried about quantity than they are quality. They work every weekend.
good,It's an ok job if you need quick pay the management isnt too good  . I prefer to work with a little bit better people . People who listen to their employees and know their jobs better . The company is more interested in quantity and not much in quality . They waste a lot of product .
good,"Tyson Foods has great benefits and will work with your schooling to help you advance further in your education. Tyson as a whole company is great to work for, however, the atmosphere in this location needs some work."
good,"overall I like my job as supervisor however, the Team Members do not have any work ethics. They make the supervisor position very difficult. The lack of upper management  is why I would leave."
good,The best thing was that you would work 4 hours and get paid for 8 hours.the hardest part was having U.S.D.A  inspection you work at your on pace self motivation
good,The Management didn't follow the plans and rules that the company had in place each supervisor did what they needed to do  to get the orders out. There was continued confusion on the production lines with employees that had a good amount of time with the company and the new starts. The training period time wasn't long enough for an individual to get the speed needed to perform the job's position.
good,The management is far to detached from knowing the needs of the normal workers. They make decisions without any thought of what it may cost them in the future and that is the cause of many headaches while working here.
good,its ok but could be extremely better. you really never have time for yourself while working here.The time you get off is not fair we only get one day off guaranteed.
good,"Tyson Foods Inc. is a good place to work overall. The position I held at the Truck Shop was a position with little to no advancement opportunities. Unless your goal is to become a diesel mechanic, even then you have to wait a long time for a position to open up."
good,DSD business working with bread delivery to grocery stores.  no patience from most stores and receivers.  hard to get along with and upper management does not care about how many hours you work or a family life balance
good,Tyson is a good place to work if you can deal with the extra drama it has to bring with the job. They have a lot pros & cons to the job but its to much unfairness and favoritism done out there
good,Good pay and benefits for mechanics and supervisors. Pay is based on training level and if the company feels you advance too fast they'll prevent you from training. Supervisors and management try to create a wall of separation from hourly employees. No floor training at all as experienced mechanics and supervisors don't want to waste their time. Some leads will help train a new mechanic.
good,"I enjoyed my job on the whole bird line.  The last supervisor i had was a great supervisor when he was there.  My biggest reasons for not wanting to show up for work in the end, was that my GPM was unwilling to work with me on time i needed off for dental work.  The next biggest complaint is the lack of staff on night shift."
good,You had to work at an fast pace so you can get the product to the other side at an timely manner. You had to make sure that you focus on what the task at hand.
good,4 days on 3 off however while i worked there i always had overtime and 1 day off didn't mind it but 6 days a week with over 12 to 14 hours a day will burn anyone out at some point other than that great people leadership and fun working environment if you allow it to be and do your job right.
good,"Co-workers were a lot of help but management could careless about anything, let alone their worker's. Management and HR are tied together and do not help employees out. Supervisor's would promise you the world but never follow through. They weed out who they want to go. I was a utility operator and at time's I had to do two or three jobs at once.."
good,When i first started at Tyson Foods it was a good easygoing job. however when the new plant manager and supervisor showed up it want down hill and fast. they stopped caring about the employee and just wanted the lines filled no matter how it got done.
good,"Too many employees being promoted to Lead or Supervisor w/o the experience and/or knowledge to back up the position. Too many Burmese being hired, promoted and being treated to a different standard than the rest of the employees."
good,"A typical day at work would be disorganized as in we didn't know who was going to do what because of lack of communication. Management didn't have respect for team members and lack communication skills toward leads, trainers, and team members. The hardest part of the job is the lack of respect for one another. People seem to talk to one another with profanity and disrespect. Also another is some leadership team members wants to get paid top dollar but doesn't want to do the job. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people of different backgrounds. Teaching them to make a living off of deboning a chicken. Seeing them no nothing to being one of our most loyal team members, like family."
good,"It's a good place to get a fresh start in life. The work is constant work. It's really cold in the facility, only because the product have to be a certain temperature."
good,"My time at Tyson albeit short was  okay up until I hurt my arm, then their inhumanity showed a bit, complete lack of care for your injuries (I couldn't even move my arm and drive but they demanded I show up in spite of me living 30 miles away) and when I brought in my doctors not for further injuries the time was still counted against me so...I mean if you need work and you can stay healthy, you're good. But a word of advice, don't get hurt or you'll get tossed like a worn out tool."
good,"I have worked with various groups in IT at Tyson, and most groups are either ok, or are pretty good. However, I have never seen such complete incompetence from the management like I see in IS HR team. Our management does not care or support their own people; we constantly have to deal with snobbish and at times degrading comments. We are being talked down to, as if we are misbehaving children, not adults. "

good,"Get your truck inspected hookup to a trailer go to farm get loaded "
good,"The managers lack compassion and understanding for their workers. You have to jump through several hoops to even go see a doctor despite the fact that you work in a cold and wet environment. The pay was good, which is the ONLY reason I stayed loyal to this company for nearly two years"
good,"Tyson is not a bad place to work if you are looking to make decent money quickly but I dont believe is where one should settle. There are a lot of policies in place I do not agree with which in the end can cause you not to advance with the company. You get paid every Thursday but you are required to work every holiday excluding Christmas and Thanksgiving day but you do get holiday pay as long as you work the day before,day of, and day after. You get to use your birthday as a holiday at work to request off with your supervisors permission. I strongly recommend getting FMLA once your first year of employment rolls around. Tyson does not like paying individuals for being home so they will try to make you come to work anyway despite getting hurt on the job and they will still give you a point for missing work due to a workmans comp doctor appointment if the doctor takes you out of work for a day or two which is not right along with not paying you.Many individuals do not follow the rules and management just turns a blind eye until something happens."
good,Very good competitive wirk with great benefits and great opportunities in advancement at Tyson foods.Management is courteous and attentitive to their employees and strive to be accident free
good,Tyson well the Tyson I work at in Van Buren Ar needs a lot of improvement in all areas. They don't follow any of their rules they only apply to people who they feel isn't fit . Basically it doesn't matter how old you are or the experience you have if you don't know someone in charge your not getting a job or benefits you deserve unless they like you.
good,Very fast paced nor a job everyone is capable of doing on a daily basis  as you advance the pressure and stress also advance with you the environment is cold and wet
good,Ahy que ser muy rapido. Area muy fria y mojada. Se corta las carne con cuchillo y estijera.
good,It is not a company I would apply to again.  The jobs were not hard.  Some of the people were nice but others want to talk and leave the wort to others.  Supervisors only cared about their own quotas.
good,"Good pay for the type of work.  Long probation period,  The job is hard on your hands, union based. A lot of Forenigners so they is a language barrier. their management could use more structure but overall it isnt the worst ive seen"
good,New management comes in..start firing old management within a month. The hourly team members aren't respected enough or compensated enough. Injury rate is high and turnover is even higher.
good,Typical night at work can be hard at times. The people who work there are okay and willing to help when needed. It can be very laid back at times.....
good,"people talk behind each others backs, and run and tell on you for the smallest things. the pay is good, but working 7 days a week is terrible. the training is poor as well"
good,This company is bad news. Tyson works 6 days a week and most holidays. The company shows the chicken more respect than the employees. There process is ill managed and needs to be restructured from the inside out.
good,"Work 6 days per week (mandatory).The job is face paced and you stand on a cement floor 8-11 hours per day. Starts at minimum wages."
good,This is a wonderful job if you have thick skin and do not mind being talked down to everyday. Your supervisors and fellow employees do nothing but bad mouth each other due to the constant fear of being fired. Tyson rules with an iron fist. If you disagree with me then you have not made it up high enough in the corporate ladder at this facility.
good,"Very repetitive position that takes time to adjust to because even if you have done manual labor before, this position uses muscles that you didn't know you had!!"
good,"repair computer equipment"
good,productive fun place to work with plenty of exercise.learned how to handle chicken in the proper manner honest fun loving co-workers.
good,"Poor leadership and no personal life. Aspect you to work at the last minute with no notices. They allow a full shift to come to work and then inform team members low volume; Full shift is not required. Very inconsiderate and no respect for employee. The best part about working for this company is a paycheck, benefits and having a job."
good,"Started out to be a great place to work for, then the company started to make management changes and turned out for the worst."
good,Typical day at work starts at 5:00 am. My job has 2 post as a scaler the front and 1 post in the back. The post in the back weighs the pepperoni racks as they are received in the line. Once they are weighed and tagged they are pushed on the rail line to the other person that is in the back.  Hardest part of the job would be filling both lines with racks to be used by the guys hanging the pepperoni. The most enjoyable part of my job is just knowing that the meat has gotten out to the cookhouse to be cooked.
good,typical day would be set up machines with material and maintain supply threw the work day. co workers were great to  work with everyone was willing to help each other daily management never came around that much but the ensured that the job was getting done.
good,"leading and assisting customers to select the best product , reviewing their merchandise and cashing out , closing and opening the store"
good,"Not a bad job, pay and benefits are good, work life balance is not so good. Job culture is not so good. Management is weak. it is a cold place to work and the hours are long."
good,"I have to go in and supervise my line of people to make sure they are doing there job correctly. I have to make sure they are wearing their proper PPE. I deal with a lot of people with different attitudes so I have to stay in control of my words and actions towards others. There are times when people may not be having a good day and try to take it out on you, but that's when I have to bring it to my supervisor's attention. I feel like a lot of times I bring an issue to my supervisor he does not handle it the proper way, I also feel like he don't have my back certain times when he should."
good,"My typical day at work I worked in the day pack department so it was extremely cold, one of teh coldest department there was to work in. It was also wet so we had to wear long boots so that your feet didn't get wet. We would rotate every 2 hours. Some of us would be hanging chicken while others would be sealing them in a vac line, then there was other people who made and stacked boxed filled with blue liners. We also had a dry ice line and whenever the boxes of chicken would come around you had to shovel a whole bunch of dry ice into the cox of chicken to keep it fresh and it would continue down a conveyor belt and then they would go to a different department which was the shipping department."
good,Running machine putting out packaged product. management was not the best when there was a problem.
good,Very easy job but management has a lack of direction and seems to be running the plant into the ground. Would not recommend to anyone I know.
good,The work isn't that hard . The only thing is when the line is short and you have to do multiple jobs that will put a strain onto your body.
good,"feed haul delivery,  not interested in this company any more, !!! want to work for a company that treats there drivers as people and not numbers"
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was making a difference. Watching the department improve in every category year by year. And knowing that you created that atmosphere.
good,"Production driven, its all about numbers.  Downtime is critical mass situation.  Stressful job, great people, some with minimal skills and lack of iniative/ motivation.  Key team players carry the weight of others and are compensated inadequately.  Constant retraining new employees.  "
good,I enjoyed the physical work because it helped me stay in shape.  However I was uncomfortable working with such hostile people around such dangerous machinery.
good,"Everyday it is below 40 degrees. Everyday the job duty is to dismantle hogs to make into sausage. The co-workers are ruff and vulgar. The hardest part of the job is the physical manual labor, making the same cut 4-6 times a minute."
good,"Made very good money to start out, advancement is limited and hard to come to. And if you have family and are working second shift, plan on not seeing them much. Like any place, youre going to have to take the good with the bad. Seemed Tyson had alot more bad then other company's though. It was a job, and it made a pay check."
good,we processed live birds had to keep production machines running the line must stay running with very few stops
good,The good old boy club. If you can put the company and all the egos that go with it before everything in the world it is a great job.
good,"it pay the bills ,but not safe place to work at.a typical day 8 to 12 hr"
good,The plant would be able to keep good employees and have more effective production if there were better management in charge.
good,It was nice to work there but you can only take Hostile Managers for so long
good,Tyson in center Texas does a great job with customer satisfaction but could definitely use some work when it comes to the work environment. They have a very night turn over rate and I feel that it’s a direct reflection of the work environment. One solution I would recommend is filling job openings with individuals that take more pride in culture that they wish to achieve.
good,"I want to look for jobs that can pay "
good,Got fired for an incident at work with another employee... And they went over socia media conversations and threats the other employee made... Didnt even let me defend myself and got band from tysons for good..
good,"People there are amiable, and have very diversified backgrounds racially and spiritually. The work itself fit my abilities well, as I was able to keep production at peak performances throughout my work week."
good,"I was told there would be an opportunity to work 1st shift upon hire, however there are no positions available on 1 st shift. There r employees working 2nd shift that have been waiting for 1st shift positions for years."
good,"The job over all wasn't bad. Main problem I had was how far I had to drive. Coworkers were pretty nice, and the higher ups were pretty easy to talk to. Would recommend to anyone that lives closer to the company."
good,I enjoyed working there they showed me a lot just had to move back to sc to help my mother. If I hadn’t I would still be employed there. I loved my boss
good,Both times I worked for Tyson's they moved me to hutchinson plant rather than keep me in south hutchinson where I applied with no availability to transfer back.
good,Worked multiple hours scheduled for 8 work mainly 12 per day sometimes even on holidays pay was decent but no time off meant I couldn't enjoy the benefits of being paid
good,Been somewhat good to me and family. Would recommend for entry level only. Slow at promoting at some locations. Is good to team members. Benefit package is on track with most Fortune 500 companies.
good,"Very difficult physical job with a lot hazard even though there is safety procedures but the health system doesn't work efficiently. Before applying, make sure you have a great knife skills and ready to work rapidly for long hours."
good,Jobs are simple. Work place is alright. Moving up can be complicated. Everyone knows about everyone in the environment. Jobs can be hard on the body..
good,They are feminists there at Tyson. They single you out. I did not agree with the management there. I worked 3rd shift and the main supervisor there was hard to work for.
good,"good place to work if they could keep everything running and not work supervisors 55+ hrs per week and do everything payroll ,safety, hr discipline, work on a line because off team members not showing up and hr. not assigning points to employees for missing work."
good,pay is terrible and no opportunity for advancement. Great supervisor and manager though. other than that it was pretty much ok place to work to gain some experience
good,I didn't like it wet conditions the smell and the pay wasn't close to the work i did. I learned many jobs from hanging chickens to sanitation in which I cleans all the machinery off at tge end of each shift and before I actually cleaned off the machinery at end of each shift I had to run the pet food area and stack the bloks of pet food that came down The line in which I had to stack it on a pallet block after block until the line stopped.it was wet cold but it was a job made way until I got something better back then.
good,Scheduling varied. Some people are more worried about what others are doing than their own jobs. Some people are not reliable and take advantage of others knowing there are limited amount of employees. Management seemed laid back while enjoying and reaping their benefits at others despair. When an issue was reported it seemed it was not taken seriously. Some of us were not honored when requesting different tasks to be reassigned.
good,"My position was very fast paced and very stressful with upper management always down trying to change things but not thinking through the changes  "
good,I like the people i worked with and my team members but upper managment will throw you away for nothing and you are out in cold but overall it was a good job if u can handle the dress
good,Was a very loose working environment with a lot of young immature people.Never knew what time you would be getting off.The supervisors were very laidback.
good,"Everyday was the same. I've known people personally to have unprofessional encounters with Tyson Foods and their Union system. I've also known people to get terminated as soon as they become qualified. Otherwise, they mean no harm and is a great place for anyone as long as it's the right position for them."
good,"This is only pork plant in the area. Over than that, it was the only company with an interesting pay rate. What I really appreciated with Tyson within the four months spent is its hiring and training system shaped to accommodate people in accordance with their skills and affordability of the position."
good,not enough family time. long hours manadatory overtime work almost every saturday. management do not listen to you. cant keep any employees everyone quits always shorthanded
good,Lack of proper training leads to failure. Just a regular factory environment. I would honestly not say anything too good or bad about the place. Training needs to be taken much more seriously though.
good,"When it was Advance Pierre, it was a good place to work, but after Tyson took over the changes became unbearable the culture changed, as did the atmosphere."
good,I learned how to operate scales and bar code machines. i also learned how to operate mixing machines. I learned  alot about people and i have taught alot of things also
good,I worked at the Vienna ga location of Tyson.  went  there to make a difference.  but I soon learned that they cared little about management. There where times I was the only supervisor that required 5 supervisors.  Long hours and no recognition. No benefits for 90 days.
good,"Underpaid for work performed. Schedule is horrible. Hard to get raises. Understaffed in maintenance, to include management. No paid sick days, so you are almost forced to come to wok sick."
good,"Tyson is filled with chicken that you grade rather it's good or bad. Some be bruised and some may drop, but you learn some different at Tyson! Meet new people."
good,It was a good work place but not for someone looking for their first job. It's very quick paced and you have to stand up for a long period of time. It was hard sometimes but it's workable anyway.
good,"I worked 3rd shift, my day was tear down the machines for cleaning, do minor repairs as needed, perform maintenance on the weekends."
good,they just simply do not pay enough. for the amount of work that we do. Most of my paycheack goes on gas just getting there is hard work. I live 57 mins away.
good,"I liked the job, most of the people.  HR needs much improvement and training on their company policies.  HR not friendly or helpful, you must be careful as they tell all your business to other employees."
good,"Due to the number of positions, work environments, as well as type of employees, its near impossible to summarise any work experience one might have. The attitudes, behaviors, and views of the employees, the weather, as well as the state of the equipment will vary day to day. One day everything would go smoothly and the next, anything and everything that could go wrong will."
good,"The average rate of pay for my position is $21 I was paid $14, a direct competitor in the same city pays my position at $19. No raises and one-time payment of $1,000 which they overtaxed so take home was $212."
good,Needed a lot of improvement in their sanitation department. Equipment needed improvement and more team members to help complete assignments. More supervisors would have also helped.
good,"They've kept everyone in IT in limbo since September with the threat of losing their jobs. Kind of hard to work or get anything accomplished under that type of environment. I was hoping for some good changes, but instead: company is keeping some bad management and got rid of everyone who pointed out where changes are needed. IT is a disaster area right now, as no one knows where everything is going. They should have changed managers a long time ago in IT HCM team, instead we have to continue to tolerate this incompetence, hostile work environment, and blunt favoritism."
good,checking badges and documenting the premises. i learn to check truck meters and fill out document sheets for the company.. management was very challenging due to lack of respect and other issues. work place was cool to be around. the hardest part of the job was working in bad wheather
good,"I learned a lot at Tyson Foods, Inc. In a typical day you can work 10+ hours depending on what is happening, even 20 hours per day Management is changing as reorganization is currently underway for the third time, in recent times. I really enjoyed the people that work at Tyson."
good,at worst the turnover hit 75 percent the place is a meat grinder. Me and fellow team  members felt at multiple times we would be better off with a  radio to contact support departments than with some of our supervisors. some were fine but others  were  truly monstrous
good,I worked in the dark meat department.  I pushed around a cart and picked up chicken tenders from every line in the department.  I also sprayed down all of the line machines when the line workers went on break.
good,No current job review at this time. I had some problems with other employees that interfered with the overall work experience and production along with unnecessarily long work hours
good,I worked all shifts & many departments in Tyson. I learned different fork lifts and many different jobs at the warehouse. It's a job that most people work but don't like to be there.
good,Once Tyson acquired Hillshire the culture changed for the worst.  You are no longer an employee but just a means to get the job done while people in a higher position take the credit.
good,"I worked with good lateral colleagues.  HR was not much.  Pay was decent. High stress.  Worked 6days/week, 60- 70 hours week, sometimes more.  I did learn quite a bit about food processing and sanitation procedures."
good,"Tyson is a decent place to work.  Unless you end up on a higher ups bad side.  I was able to learn many different positions and aspects of"
good,Ok place to work had fire and I was head of the clean up crew I worked at night while plant was shut down it was a good job experience enjoyed my time there
good,"Though it is a lot of manual labor, the staff was mostly alright to work with and the pay was decent. Have to stand for long periods of time which over time can be very difficult."
good,"It is a very diverse culture which is awesome but sometimes trying. Over all it isn't a bad place to work, but it's way to many hours. If you work second shift you live there!"
good,"I was Laid-Off due to the termination of a shift and I lacked the seniority to get assigned to a different position.  Usual Union job though, Great Pay, Good Benefits and Loads of drama would like to use other words."
good,its a job not really something you wanna do for years. its good paying though and have benefits.the jobs is easy its just hard to stay awake. if you are young with no kids this is perfect.
good,A great place to work.  The employees are amazing - they are what makes this company great!  Great benefits and having weekends off were amazing.  Paid holidays and vacation time were an added bonus.
good,Long days and was expected to be on call 7 days a week.had a territory that covered about a 25 % of the state and had to deal with employee issues.  We worked a split week so very seldon did we get 2 days off in a row
good,"Along with other unique machines Tyson Foods Evisceration lines are really interesting and will give you a one of a kind ,up close look at mechanical engineering at its best."
good,"I worked for this company for some few years. I had learned a lot from this company. The company was very successful in ran daily to daily business because its employees diversity background, integrity from the top leadership to all the the employees down the line, and as well as maintaining their employees."
good,It gave me a good place to start but there wasn't much opportunity to advance as it was a bubble of drama and only those with the right alliances will go up with their buddies.
good,"I worked many job at Tyson and I have it posted on my resume. My last position was fork lift driver. I was a pile jack driver, manifested, sanitation worker,unload and loaded trucks."
good,Very enjoyable place to work. Hours are long some days if you make them. Time management is priority if you want to be home at a reasonable time.
good,"this company not have a good secure work, has a lot probles with the manufacturing process, need to be more focus in the process the have a lot probles in almos all process"
good,overnight shift very tiresome and long work hours but no OT good place to make friends not money not really any fast advancement no matter your effort
good,I assisted and leaned the plant to ensure that  product would not be contaminated. We also were responsible for maintaining cleanliness throughout the plant.Climbing and stooping
good,"learned a lot on this job, benefits are excellent but management is terrible no  communication, no teamwork. they operate very, very sloppy."
good,"Overall Tyson foods is a good company to work for. I liked the challenges that came up an a daily basis. A typical day started out for me was to go to the setup shop and gather the different kits it took to get my slicer machine up and running and start processing the meat for the production line. For the most part I got along great my co-workers. There are always a few people that don't get along with other people but that's just about everywhere you go. I learned a long time ago that if you go in and do your job and work with people to the best of your capabilities, it makes the day go by a lot faster.The hardest part of any job is working with people that don't want to listen to you even when you may have considerable knowledge about a certain operation or process. Especially when it comes to doing something safely and productively. I have seen quite a few co-workers in the past hurt or injured themselves or others because they would not listen to reason and just did what they wanted to do. That is what makes for  long hard day. And I try to avoid getting involved in dangerous situations and people like that. Communication or the lack of communication at critical times in a production workplace can be very demoralizing an counterproductive."
good,"Good amount of room to prosper, well educated staff, safe work environment, good pay with plenty of hours. Also the ability to learn different jobs, such as forklift, bobtail trucks, and different machines"
good,"Sanitation is very important when dealing in the food industry. The hardest part is making sure everyone is doing their part. My work environment was full of nice, funny working people. I remember always wear those slicks."
good,there is no team work the management there is very poor they treat their staff bad the benifits was ok the pay is not worth the jobs u do
good,Lot of good people to work with. Safety needed to be better. Vary good equipment to work with. We did something different each day. Worked along most of the time. Given Safety bonuses each year for no wrecks.
good,"Receiving, verifying and calculating stacker sheets to determine accuracy and completion of loads."
good,"Everything in Maintenance needs a scape goat  someone did something wrong or it would never of broke, very good pay and benefits if you can take the long hrs and people screaming at you all the time"
good,"A typical day at work is, be at your work station on time, know your job, step right into it, be fast paced. Management is all over the place checking to see if production is being made, co-workers are great ,makes the day past by fast, and there is no hard part of my job because I know what to do. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing that I have done my best."
good,Poor pay but good chance for advancement. Must be able to deal with food processing.
good,"A typical day was getting my order sheets, then setting my area up for stacking the product on pallets.  This would include, pallets, shrink wrap, tickets, etc."
good,Operate forklift with computer inventory keyboard. Unload truck and compare merchandise to invoice and manifest. Move pelleted products to freezer bin.
good,I go in dressed in double layers of clothing to keep warm. I get my hand guards and proceed to my line. I stand there and cut wings until it's time for my break.
good,"Corporate managing in small town environment, safety is paramount. Fast paced work. Hardest part of the job was keeping up with level testing and having a regular life since production determines the hours you work."
good,I really liked the company when I started.  upper management forced me to move departments and gave me no options to change.
good,I would change and dress adults who were disabled and could no longer do it themselves or had other disabilities. I learned how to deal with different personalities and how to follow through with any situation thrown at me. My co-workers worked right along me. The hardest part of the job would have been leaving the people I cared for behind. And the most enjoyable part were the people I took care of.
good,Days working at Tyson Foods are routine. Nice friendly people and a place where you can grow.
good,"I cut meat (picnic) hams.  It was a very rushed, assembly line type job.  I later had transferred to the packaging department and packaged the different cuts of meats. The most enjoyable part of the day was the end of shift, when it was time to go home. But regardless I made the most of each day and had a positive attitude."
good,same good people constant work some weekends off no overtime
good,"Learned about Total-Australasia company by preparing results for US Monthly Board Finance meeting, providing commentary for New York Group and Pacific Management (Fiji & PNG) reporting. Acquired new skills in Sarbanes Oxley testing for incoming cheques. Found all processes to be SOX compliant."
good,"A days work at Tyson is all ways different but the same. We have different machine on the line that we do P/M, we also have to keep the production lines running.The production managementare hard to work with,but my maintenace co-workers are great."
good,I did not like working there for many reasons...they did not treat thier employees very well and treated like we were worker ants.  
good,"Hillshire Brands is a decent place to work.  They have flexible hours, good benefits, and the workload is manageable.  I have enjoyed the time that I have spent with the company and the people. "
good,A typical day at work consisted of multiple duties that included jack driver or line lead.
good,I work rehang of chicken and it is a long boring repetive job. You do get two 30 min breaks but those asre negated with overtime that can have you working up to six hours extra straight or more. The attendence system is harsh and you live by a quota and have to work weekends to do more and more kills and processing.
good,"space constrained to install new machineries and equipment is challenging, but same time we enjoy and learned related things."
good,Great if you like repetitiveness and low pay compared to most factory jobs.
good,This job was very demanding and took up a lot of my spar time from my children. I would work 12 hour shifts and then I would end up having to work 7 days a week. The pay was fine but you never really saw any overtime.
good,A typical day at work would consist of working hard for little pay.
good,"Decent company with reputable brands. Unfortunately, they displaced a lot of jobs overseas, taking away precious jobs for many Americans."
good,A lot of work with machinery constantly breaking down. Plant was closed die to down sizing.
good,It's a buddy buddy system if you want to progress further into management from hourly. Good place to make quick  money.  However I enjoyed somthing there to face the challenges the had
good,Not bad overall some good and bad things pay is usually pretty good managers and engineers weren’t to great recommend to someone straight out of highschool
good,Tyson is ok to work at but I don't see any advancement  here cause they don't want to lose maintenance people from the floor.plus I am looking to move down south of here.
good,"From the beginning of the hiring process up until the last day I worked there, the lack of communication here was horrible. Trying to get a straight answer from anyone here is difficult. I didn’t know what time I was suppose to start due to being told two different times by two different leaders, but when I showed up early to be sure I wouldn’t miss the shift I was told I did things wrong. Once I worked myself from a warehouse worker to a mechanic, I waited a month before I knew the day I’d be transferring. Very frustrating trying to get a answer from someone"
good,a typical day is come in go to your huddle meeting the job is pretty simple and strait forward meat comes down the line and you make sure it dose not get into the seal
good,"If they would allow us to atleast rotate weeks or rotate shifts the turnover rate would be alot less. The management staff is pretty good, some still need to be firm and fair and consistent"
good,It was a okay job with good pay. I like my department it wasn’t to big or to small. We enjoyed cutting up thighs everyday. The better the production the better our pay would be. It is also painful in some ways a lot of people catch carpal tunnel in their hands for working so much
good,this company was okay to work for was a freezer warehouse . If being cold for 12 hours isn’t something you want then please don’t apply  .. rules are strict
good,It's A great place to work and Grow...if they put you in the right setting with better Supervision... They don't take the proper step... no Social no supervisor or no people skill...
good,"High stress, extremely fast placed, 60hr work weeks, long training period, generally hard labor and high demands, but very under paid. Hard to make advances into higher paid positions without pandering."
good,It's like working and prison I do understand work as to get done but do to the stress and low pay not all but I feel like alot of line leader need to take communication class
good,"Starting off it was a decent job. The money was nice and the people where descent and it was a regular 8 hour a day 40 hrs a week with a fair amount of overtime. Then the schedule changed in the department, to 12 hrs a day, 40 hrs a week with overtime that was realistically out of the question. Since advancement was not a factor, I was force with a kind of tough decision to just go eleswhere."
good,"When I first started at Tyson Foods, Inc. it was a big company run like a family business.  As time when by, and other companies were bought and brought into the fold, the culture began to change."
good,No matter how hard you try to make money management keeps your pay around the same as others that dont run as hard as you want to...and there is alot of down time that you don't get paid for
good,Working there was ok but advancement is not guaranteed. I  tries over and over and got passes over by people with less seniority and not as much experience. They play favorites and habe people chosen before a job is even posted.
good,"Tyson's Foods is a company that is available for people who need a job ,without discrimination, but as a whole, the company plays favoritism to certain nationalities. Opportunities for advancement is available. Management treats people in a harsh way, they use their Authority to intimidate team members,they pick and choose who they help or who they like .Management is constantly changing constantly. You never know what time you will get off work if you work 2nd shift .1st shift gets all perks and 2nd shift does all the extra work."
good,Well 50 + hours a week and the hr and management are crazy there was a guy fall at work and they want to fight the workmen comp claim over craziness told him to do short term disability well now he is looking for better job place is great if you dont get hurt and can deal with people yelling at you over dumb ness
good,"Fast paced "
good,it was not bad wish they care more about their employees wellness. And need more time to put on your safety equipment after each of your break hope this review helps.
good,"You must be kin to someone to advance in this work area. Young management, Applied for other jobs that was qualified for and turned down because was not kin to boss or office help."
good,Very noisy place of working. Its a lot of drama in certain areas of working. I love the job but the people were very full of drama. It paided the bills but other than that I would recommend a dramam free person to work there.
good,Clock in go to work station do job an clock out for lunch take 30 min lunch break go back to work site start work again for 10 hours clock clean work area gather things an clock out go home
good,"I had a wonderful time while I worked at Tyson of Lexington, Ne. I being a Caucasian female in her early 50's and I read, write, and speak fluently Spanish, my co-workers were astounded by me. I had a Somalian supervisor teaching me, his native language. I spoke to a variety of Supervisors on a daily bases. The worst part was, I was terminated due to being injured on the job, after my surgery on my shoulder cuff."
good,Look at you life and realize that there's more to life than the daily grind. Everyday the drive is not worth the while if you work with 50 year olds who hate life and purposely suck at their jobs. A lot of people fake their injuries too.
good,"Fast paced environment."
good,Maintaining all electrical systems in the poultry plant. Stressful times when machinery broke down limited understanding from upper management about repair time
good,Place is not a bad place to work just that the managers are picky on whatever jobs to give out. They have a mean crouchy security. The other bosses are r pretty good. I just think i made the wrong choice getting in debone..
good,"overseeing various processing operations and working with other supervisors in solving problems, relations functions such as training, retaining, and counseling on personal and professional problems."
good,Plant is ran by  complex manager(dictator) that is carried down by supervisor with no voices. Team members make huge sacrifices and literally keep plant running.
good,Great place to work . Supervisors need to attend more to the floor while production is underway but great company. Great  steady pace sometimes gets slow but great place
good,I am looking forward to an opportunity for advancing my career because I did not feel the opportunity was available at Tyson. Advancement seems to be available at other companies.
good,This was a very hard job on your body.  You had to work long hours in very hot and smelly conditions.  The job pace was very fast and stressful trying to make high quotas to reach bonuses and leave work early.
good,Good place to work . I learned a lot. Worked there over 11 years a;ways treated fairly for the most part. I would recommend to friends and family.I would work for Tyson again.
good,Its not a hard job at all alot of sitting around and waiting if work harder then other people tjey take advantage of you and waych you do thrre job theres good people that work there
good,"I never pushed my employees to out do anybody, I kept them comfortable,  I gave them breaks, allowed them to express their opinions, in return I acted upon their stresses. Which in return we set numbers that's still not bet met. It's all in how you treat your employees.  After all what they do, makes you look good.  But it was never about me, it was them. I gave them pizza, cupcakes, gifts whatever, cause they made me just as much as I made them."
good,"management was ridiculous in their expectations of employees, pay was severely behind most factories, proper procedure wasnt followed just to finish orders, refusal to let people off work even for court and dr appts with a prior note. its a surprise it hasnt been hut down for horrible ethics and work environment. but its local"
good,Top management is good but the leads are not good with. The speed demanded and the work environment is stressful. The pay is not commensurate to work.
good,"Good pay, but lots of hours with very little time off.  Operations team are drivern by productivity an Yield for the location.  Mostly work every weekend.  Six days per week."
good,"we stretched, got our goals, accomplishment and faults, and sent to work. sorted out who was working where and went to pulling our levels. learned to lift heavy weight correctly the importance of team work. the most difficult part of the job was lifting the boxes from lower bins to the high raised lines. the work environment was cold and difficult to get everyone to work together."
good,If your not on first shift your nothing. Maintenance manager at Haltom plant does not care. He doesn't communicate. Why am I even here. I work my but off trying troubleshooting industrial equipment so I fell like I done something today. I fell unnoticed. That's alright looking for a new job.
good,My review on Tyson's Food is that you have to be fast pace day in and out.I learned how the company works with very serious life skills.Working with different cultured people and different nationality.The hardest part of the job was the temperature.The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my coworkers
good,"Tyson says they are family oriented, they are not.  They do not accept doctor notes if you miss.  You will be pointed if you miss and even if you clock in 1 second late.  Prearranges have to be done 24 hours in advance, so if your doctor admits you into the hospital you will be pointed if it doesn't qualify for FMLA."
good,"I really liked working there because of how much there was to do and I was always doing something else every day, but the supervisors and management there were awful. My supervisor left because of everything that was going on."
good,Tyson Foods is good place to work if you want to get a lot of money and to have a good income. Tyson is the big company i knew in Iowa. Multi cultures
good,"Good place to work to get you back on your feet. "
good,"This was not my first time at Tyson Foods, so I was thinking it was going to be fairly the same, I expected a couple of changes, but it was nothing like I expected.  Team members were very rude and disrespectful, GPM, HR, line leaders ignored me completely, It was a horrible experience for me.  I stayed depressed, I just felt ignored by everyone"
good,"I worked at tyson foods for about eighteen months (a year and a half).  It was hard work when I worked on the white meat line trimming meat.  This caused permanent damage to my left wrist thus resulting in carpal tunnel syndrome.  I still have issue with this.  "
good,I did not like the workplace . its not friend friendly. they was always rude and not ansering question and always making u work dangerusily. unsafe on.
good,"I liked the job primarily because of the friendships I developed with my co-workers. The work itself is nothing exciting. The people you work with either make it or break it. From my observations, however, it seemed like a dead end job with no one there ever receiving promotions."
good,constant rule changes strenuous work poor management skills and conflict resolution hand injuries common good benefits most weekends off paternalistic environment
good,"With better management and supervisors this would be a great place to work and retire. There were double standards and requests to do maintenance around foods that were on the production line that were not authorized by USDA guidelines."
good,it was very stressful i was doing the job of three people by myself. i asked for help repeatedly and didnt get any. after i left they hire more people to do the job i was doing by myself
good,"It was good hours but the environment was stressful "
good,It is a great place to get the experience to get a better job. The pay is not good. There are no bonuses and raises are few and far between. The insurance is alright not great tho.
good,Tyson has its way of manage-ring and its the Tyson way but sometimes when the company hire from the outside and upper managers come in their strategies from previous  employment sometimes clash.
good,interesting place to work. managers definitely pick favorites and treat them well. alot of supervisors try to have relations with employees . its a good paying job if u keep your head down n are invisible
good,Plenty of hours and pay if needed. Fast pace and experience required for night shift. Self motivated needed and organization required to stay up with 13 dock doors.
good,"Managers were not fair.  It was fast paced. When packing you need to be fast to keep up with the speed of products being kicked out. "
good,I enjoyed the managers and the job itself. I just had to relocate to Tifton. A typical day is me getting tot he farm at 7am and checking on the birds to make sure they have enough food and water and to check for any maintenance problems
good,"Knife work It was hard work, so no fun, no relaxed. Everyones be quite in production area, because it's high sound in work line. Sometimes employees fight each other for some reasonable issues."
good,"Safety is very important. Supervisors do their best to communicate what is going on day to day, but the schedule is ever changing. There are times when the hours are heavy, but it comes with the industry."
good,You have no home life sleep eat work peroid. To much overtime you work 6 days a week all year round practically..supervisor are really nice they are there even more hours then everyone else
good,"Overall, a good place to gain income and also a place to meet tons of people. I have the upmost respect for this company for giving people with backgrounds a second chance. Most companies discriminate and reject anybody that doesn't have a clean background."
good,Math is necessary when working for Talley person. I learned how to work directly under supervision. I learned how to work under pressure and on a time schedule.
good,"My nurse manager was an egomaniacal, lazy, brown noser, who let it be known, he was only using job as a stepping stone to corporate. He didn't like it when people could see through the facade and call his bluff. Worst nurse ever!"
good,"Overall Tyson is a good company to work for, but the amount of hours you work does not allow you to have much time outside of work. There is a lot of opportunity for advancement in the company and to move around to different locations."
good,Favoritism is a big deal in this place.  Be prepared for harrassment and plenty of back stabbing behavior.  This place is good as long as you over work yourself and the supervisors can see you breaking your back.
good,It's a place u must be alert. Watch ur surroundings. It's a good place to work tho and the benefits are great it's a very diverse place. Gotta be able to get along with ur co workers
good,"I learned how to clean poultry in performing my duties daily. A days work was good, due to what kind of job is was. There was nothing hard about the job."
good,"Great team members, hard physical work in a cold environment. Good job security and benefits. Very long hours, zero home life. Slim to none chance for meaningful advancement."
good,I was very good with training others. I have learned a lot to work with community and working with team. I like to be friends with everyone. the hardest part of the job to me is when other culture don't get along .The most enjoyable part of the job is being translator and working with community service.
good,I learned a lot working for Tyson Foods. I am thankful with this company. Management in my opinion is far for being professionals. It is a pity. The best of this place is that it is an school by it self if you want to learn.
good,Tyson wasn't a hard job they just worked seven days a week and now they have it all better now. its not a hard job very simple and you are trained good.
good,Plenty of work to do and to be done and at least 40hrs a week. Some team leaders and supervisors can and will seek to make good workers jobs harder than necessary. you only get about 2 breaks throughout a 8-10 hour work period and only a 20 minute lunch...included within the 2 breaks
good,Great  people to work with. Management  is cool too the work is easy too.  washing machines off with a pressure hose and chemicals the negative is you work everything night they pay is not bad but it ain't great
good,"I made sure the floor and machines had stayed cleaned., I also had to throw away birds that wasn't any good., and I had to make sure that everything was cleaned out good."
good,"Tyson in Waterloo, Iowa is one of the best paying employers in the area. Consistent work schedule and hours as well as benefits. seasonal overtime opportunities depending on production requirements."
good,"You are working in a freezer."
good,old equipment. needs to be updated. its a job thats about all i can say for this company. bad conditions for employees. managers need to take a course on people skills.
good,"IM retiring but I would like some part time work helping chidren, get an ed.I like to see kids happy.The hardest part of the job, is when I can""t get a person to understand what Im  trying to get them to understand. But I would really smile if I coiuld see that they really understand, what they need to understand."
good,I would hang chickens in preparation for them being cut and packaged. My co-workers worked well together but management didn't communicate well with the team and wasn't supportive.
good,"This job consists of continuous assembly line work. I have learned a lot of knife skills, the managers here are very supportive and helpful. The coworkers here are very solitary and many do not speak English which makes communication difficult along with the location of the facility. The hardest part of this job is the communication barriers. The most enjoyable part is the supportive management."
good,"Enjoyed working with all the different cultures. There sometimes is a language barrier, but is a fun environment with great people."
good,You never know until the day before if you will be working mandatory OT on the weekends. Due to labor costs you never know if you will be asked to leave early. If you have seniority this is not an issue.  The employee turnover percentage is very high too for newer employees.
good,Had a lot of good friends learned more skills the hours long hard to get a break the best part you stayed busy the smell in a meat packing plant bad
good,"work life balance is behind industry best practice."
good,"Setting up equipment  for production. Repairing down equipment thru out the day. PM all equipment. I have learned a lot about industrial ovens, fryers, tumblers, and conveyors. The best part of my job is my fellow co-workers. the only reason for leaving Tyson is because work has gotten slow and they have been laying off."
good,Worked in different departments.  Learn how to work as a team lead and machine operator.  I enjoyed working with my fellow team members.
good,The jobs pay well but the work environment is harsh. It is extremely cold and wet. The winter months are the worst. Busy and fast paced.
good,The most enjoyable part of the  job was being able to move around and do the other jobs when employees were out. The management was also very helpful and willing to train in all areas.
good,"Tyson is a nice place to work.  The environment is forever evolving. If you want to move up in the company, you will have to spend time working at a plant."
good,"stressful"
good,Tyson required a lot of time at work with poor balance of home and work.  It was a very diverse culture with people from all parts of the world.
good,"I was a paper work/recorder and my duties were to fill out production sheets ,do  metal checks and check equipment for wear and tear,the log it into the computer. Used the electronic inventory management/ scanner to move product into production and to make handling units. I used electronic walkie truck to move product, and filled out pallet sheets for finished product.My co workers were some of the hardest working people I have met,they made it easier to want to work there these last couple years. The hardest part of the job was the cold air always blowing on you no matter how warm you were dressed.My coworkers were the most enjoyable part of the job.What I learned at Tyson is how to run aot of different machinery.Dont have much to say about management."
good,"come in set up for the day , production starts at 8am. learn how to manage your time there, the people are great to work , management needs to communicate better. the pay needs to be better for the one producing plant with Tyson it has the lowest pay per hour."
good,My supervisor was great to work with.The human resource officers were less to be disirable.Good pay and benefits.The hardest part of the job was changing the spiral freezer belt.
good,Great environment for gaining experience for various titles. Friendly environment but also hard-working environment for those who seek long term career choices.
good,Physical hard work you are standing in the same place for 30 minutes at a time for your whole shift. Very hard on your legs and the rest of your body.
good,"The longest 2nd shift job I ever worked."
good,"working in pack out where is it cold. the hardest part is every thing is cold steel and handling frozen chicken . Most  of my co-works are good people and work hard as well a I. Half of them do not speak English so it is hard to talk to them.  the most enjoyable part of the job is when I am on the fork lift."
good,ok company. Good working conditions. No place to grow. but nice people. Small town
good,Front line supervisor team is great. I would get to work one hour early to print off production schedule do a shift to shift passdown. The hardest part of the job was very long hours 14 hour days 6 days a week.
good,There was no job training and management was substandard.  I enjoyed learning about Industrial Ammonia Refrigeration. Job was under my skill level.
good,"To be at the line by 7:45 am to start up for the process of the poultry to be inspected and packed in proper trays to fill the orders for that line. Inspect poultry for any defeats or any thing did not meet USDA regulation. Tyson is a work place that produces poultry. A place of work that makes sure all orders are meet no matter what it takes. I learned working for Tyson the way poultry is inspected, packed and shipped. My co-workers were those who did their job according to Tyson work policies, rules & regulations. A hard day is when the machines would not work proper and orders would be delayed. A great day at Tyson is when all go as planned and orders are meet."
good,Tyson's was a good place to work for a short time. The supervisors are unfair to people they dont like. its a hard company to move up in positions.
good,A good place to start a career. It can be stressful and time management is a must.
good,"- Managed the slaughter process"
good,Overall I like Tyson Love the people I work with but sanitation is  not for me.
good,Company is loosing contracts due to poor management overlooking the big picture. Management is only worry about making money and not about quality
good,I good place to start your career path. Great for building work experience.
good,"Checked daily logs of the incoming shipments of raw materials and schedule times of the deliveries.  Verifying the shipping manifest information and count, weighs, or affix labels are accurate. Scan incoming product and enter into company network. Place in warehouse in order of usage to supply material to line. Checked all pallets for shipment against truck manifest, inspect for proper identification on wrapped pallets, and load truck. Take monthly audits of warehouse and shipping/receiving areas"
good,Tyson is great in the fact that you can make the money you need with extra overtime all the time. It's a difficult job because of the hard labor which takes a toll on your body. The management tends to pick and choose favorites rather then value or notice the hard working people. And considering you're at work for more of your week then at home it leave little to no time with family and friends.
good,"Various job sites, managers and co-workers. changed so often, there is no real way to judge"
good,Normal shift for mechanical line for product movement for packaging.
good,"I worked as a Production Worker, and a Machine Operator. I enjoyed working as a team with my co-workers."
good,they are fun to work for as long as you don't work on a production line then every thing is just so fast
good,"Very good company, but had financial difficulties and jobs were eliminated. Had good experience in HR."
good,Evolving company and with a short history of involvement in the US market.
good,Tyson foods is a great company because everybody worked as a team and everyone was on the same path when it came down to getting the job done .
good,"everyday was a challenge for me, because i received an unexpected calls, like an auger broke machine is not operating normal, it was fun to work with machinery, like waste water pumps, electrical troubleshooting, I motivated and excited to get equipment ready to work. I gave feedback to my supervisors, when it came to a new management it was difficult because they expected more then unusual, and the change of rules."
good,it was a fun and good place to work at but most people that worked their didnt care half the time and i think they should stop smoking on grounds
good,This positron required a lot of activity and it was enjoyed very much. Sometime travel was required to new location for fill-ins and that made a nice change of scenery. It was nice to be able to have a job where self motivation was required and nobody had to make sure you did your job. Physical activity could become strenuous but nothing that couldn’t be handled.
good,A hard but good job. benefits were a little weak but thats part of the economy now. all in all it's down right a fair job.
good,good co-workers.It is hard drity work and you learn alot of stuff.
good,"Maintain the efficient flow of product to lines. Manage equipment,people, and problems. I learned back then that I had a maturity problem. Management was not bad. I felt that they did not have proper training. But that was the worst thing i would say. Co-workers were great. Most people were trying to prove themselves,as i was,so we tried harder. The hardest part of the job was on those days when everything went wrong,it went really wrong. We called them putting out fire days. Fortunatly they didnt happen often. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people i worked with. I built a crew for live hang that i still brag about to this day. I was proud to work with those guys."
good,"At Tysons you learn the core values of manufacturing. You get young and fresh individuals training to perform heavy manual labor jobs. Its very challenging, but it builds your leadership skills from to ground up. USDA and quality assurance are at every corner, so that trains to learn how to deal with authorities in the workplace and address issues that are presented at hand. Safety is at the forefront of everything. This provides you with a sense of awareness and caring for your employees. Great place to make the next step forward."
good,Typical production line work. alot of samolians working there at that time
good,"Rendering is very nasty, working with animal carcasses and maggots. It is not for the feeble hearted. Tyson is a good company, good salary, pay, opportunity but you must be suited for this kind of work."
good,"Always there, almost always open. If you need work, they'll have it."
good,The work isnt hard. You just have to be on your feet for a long time. The floor is hard and the boots are uncomfortable. They care more about the product then the workers.
good,Tyson is a competitive option while you are searching for work. The worst part of the job in my opinion is that the company policy is rarely updated for clarity and applied selectively.
good,I liked the Tyson foods in pine bluff way better then north Little Rock. The experience I got in pine bluff was better and you had more chance to move up in the company. Plus the pay was better with better incentives
good,The job itself is id say is basic at times most of it is the same all day i did sanitation so im familiar with dangerous chemicals keeping machines running using the machines/equipment talking to people and working together I do my best and am wanting to continue to grow and learn more
good,Overall it’s not a bad place to work if you do not have a family. To make decent money you need to run 8 days or more. You will have to sit around a good bit waiting on loads to get ready
good,Ok experience advanced far. They hire within. ................................... management isn’t good. I don’t know what else to say it’s an ok place to work
good,It's a ok job but it didn't leave me with as much free time as I would have preferred. The work is not hard but it does take time to get to the pay u would prefer.
good,"Tyson was okay I just picked the wrong department I would definitely go back one day maybe but I’ll go to a different department if I do, where I was working it was hot & they didn’t have enough people to switch me to the front."
good,"Working at Tyson the job is very easy, it is cold in certain areas but not as much in others. There staff is not great at communicating and being on the same page as one another."
good,Its a fast demanding place to work at they will put two many pounds of chiken on freezer lines two were machine cant handle it its ok of a job if you ask me
good,"My department was shorthanded, and my job was physically demanding. Being shorthanded, we had to do more to pick up the slack. Our Supervisor and GPM did what they could to help out, but things were steadily declining. I resigned because of increasingly common and severe physical problems."
good,Very stressful place to work not a good work environment . It's not a team work place like they unless you have been there for years  . You're treating like you cattle to
good,"Worked here for 4 years happy with the stable pay and benefits, but management needs work, from the highest in management to the lowest in management."
good,Tyson's need to pay more money for the work that we do.some of the supervisor need to treat other with respect and stop down taking to other.hire more people to help out in other areas when someone need help in there work area.
good,The job environment was great. Got to meet different people it was more of a fast pace work place. No time for communication wasn't a problem for me. Just had to move only reason for leaving.
good,I totally enjoy the excessive assignment of rolling hogs. Besides being under paid for the most complicated and exerting job. I benefited more with getting in shape than benefiting financially. I traveled a hour sometimes two hours to get to work everyday.
good,Great pay and binfits clean need training more and to be able to communicate with your supervisor because some can't speak English and hardly see them
good,It wasn't really for me. The environment was kind of strange and a lot of the workers there were either unreliable or just straight up weird. Plus I wasn't a fan of ruining my clothes.
good,Ok sometimes just not always. You can't count on one day to next on same instructions for same job. It depends on which supervisor you work under. It needs more supervisors that care about the employees
good,"Good pay, but not too good management. Work in a hot environment all day, but not too bad. just monitor and watch all equipment and do repairs as needed."
good,"This was an ok job.  It served it purpose in my life at the time.  You make enough to pay the bills.  This was not a career job for me but it did provide what I needed at the time -- decent job, ok pay..."
good,"This job was fast pace but we worked as a team. the job was hard sometimes with only small breaks, but I enjoyed everyone there. Sometimes its cold and sometimes it was hot but we done the work."
good,I thank God for a job but it could be improved as with all jobs i guess.some people dont have anything.i am glad that i will only be unemployed for a short time.
good,Cold and fast passed full of a lot of people. decent manegment. long hours at times. hard working job at times. pay kept me there didn't like it one bit realy
good,Packing product at a fast pace other wise product would hit the floor. They would run machine fast then one could pack. The management never around unless a machine is down & then it why is it down & why do i need to baby sit
good,Management support is very low at this employer.  Culture of the workplace is based on how well you know upper management and not by your track record.
good,You get trained for a week and get paid for being there for 90 days. Good benefits and 401K offered. Get paid fairly reasonable and good work experience
good,Hassle free employment. Friendly staff in Human Resources. As long as employees come to work in a timely manner you are guaranteed long term employment. Tyson also offers resources outside of the physical plant.
good,"Not what you know but it is who you know.  Many workers who advanced are kiss ups instead of the ones who earned it.  Managers are not leaders, they are bosses.  No room for advancement if you ain't tight with someone in management."
good,Lack of pay and promotions cannot have a career working there it has a bad work environment the supervisors care more about chickens than they do about the employees and safety is always number 1 with me
good,"The interviewing leaders were careful not to disclose the amount of dysfunction in the immediate team much less the company as a whole (Sara Lee days). However, I found my place with good colleagues who focused on the task and didn't let the culture affect our work."
good,It was a high-paced job to perform working in production processing plant had to check bags for date codes and tears also weights fillets look for size
good,"time was not taken care of correctly and was sent home if exceeded more than two hours over time in a week"
good,"Several management changes, 1 per year the whole time I was there. Confusion regarding expectations. Management unaware of what RN Managers job role was."
good,Hard work good people slot of hours and different cultures to work with meet a lot of good hard working individuals from different nation's was a great learning experience
good,"Pay is competitive,  benefits are good, offer good training programs, relaxed atmosphere, treated like you are valued as a team member. Chance to advance."
good,"A typical day at work is fast paced.  I've learned order picking and unloading conveyors,  the management doesn't communicate well when it comes to extended hours, fun people to work with. The hardest part is the freezing cold, going in and out of freezers all day."
good,"It was more of a learning experience for me like I’ve never cut,hung or cleaned a chicken before I liked the environment that I worked in because it was well coordinated in a formal manner but as for the management it was ok but I can’t say fair"
good,Line leads only get paid 12.86/hr pay does not match work load or stress no matter what position. 10 cent raise for being there 5 years...   One thirty minute break in eight hours
good,"Stressful place to work and all they care is about making money, your safety, happiness or work life balances mean nothing to them. Depend on the plant, but there is no career advancement until you make it into corporate"
good,"Difficult work environment. Fast paced training on knives. However, training was mandatory. I worked on the processing side in the cooler. Usually fast paced. Very diverse workforce."
good,"At Tyson, you need to be accustomed to a fast-paced, challenging work environment. It has wonderful benefits and paid time off. The pay is fair, too. It just isn't an easy job, and you have to adjust to the position."
good,"A typical day at this job consists of sitting in a cubicle isolated from any other employees.  Entering invoices for payment using 10 key for 8-10 hours a day,"
good,"It was an experience to work at Tyson, but the lack of communication was a downfall. The associates working the line were awesome, and dedicated to their craft. Management held a lot of information from these workers though."
good,"Family like environment with hard working people. Lunch rooms are included along with hot meals with discount meal cost of $2.00 chicken with 2 sides. Holiday specials/gifts. Employee appreciation Friday, every Friday we get snacks. They grill for us on certain days!!"
good,"Tyson has opportunity to make good money, they have great benefits, but management sucks bad, I worked as a fabricator and did General Maintenance and I worked all 7 days a week most weeks and they expected me to stay late often and come in early, it became to much for me, I had no time to myself or with my family"
good,meeting new people and learning new things. Good pay rate excellent benefits. No weekends but long nights and most of all good food. learnig more about what I eat.
good,The work is fast paced so the days go by pretty quickly. It is very cold and it takes a toll on your body as much as the manual labor does. I would get sick a lot more because of working in their freezer.
good,Shipping department is a good to place to work if you don't care about being cold.The supervisors on 2nd and 3rd shift are good people to work for.The GPM and the first shift supervisor are both useless people they don't care about the crews at all.
good,"it very cold & stressful to work .they pay go & trainin is awesome."
good,Tyson food is A-OK workplace but you also can have a good time but the job is also stressful I really didn’t like the management the pay rate wasn’t  good
good,"Tyson is a very well known and respected company. However, growth and development has limitations. Therefore, it is hard to grow and advance your career. Learning opportunities are limited as well. The most enjoyable part of the job is working along with other team members to achieve the same goal. I learned that as a manager, you must also be able to communicate. It is important to be a leader as well as a manager."
good,Tyson foods is a nice place for opportunities you just have to want to grasp them when they are there for you to like any other job at times it might get stressful when changes happen but you just got to know that all your hard work will pay off.
good,The work is easy but very stressful. Easy place to move up in the ranks. Easy to find what you need but can't be slow or you put your line down and can get wrote up by USDA
good,"I worked with others to accomplish one goal, process the poultry to customer demand. lead and follow directions to succeed in daily activities. great atmosphere."
good,"Typical day . Suiting up from head to toe , then putting on coveralls ,beard net , hair net , gloves , steel toed shoes . Then head to the minus 10 room where you palletized product and loaded it on to the truck ."
good,"Line work is quick paced and must pay attention to detail of work, can be stressful mostly physically, and overall a fair job especially for someone starting out and could help advance your skill levels."
good,Very stressful work environment with little management direction.  Employees are discouraged from spending time with family and there are no incentives for giving your life to the success of the company while letting your family life suffer.
good,"The mergers and acquisitions of the last few years drastically changed the company culture. From an almost ""family"" atmosphere it has become demoralizing, almost toxic due to the emphasis on the bottom line while paying lip service only to what the company claims as it its biggest asset - its people. This last round of restructuring, Tyson has lost some very good people - many dismissed unceremoniously. There are still a lot of good, talented people around. However, all the sudden changes in processes, systems and management priorities and styles is negatively impacting productivity, - hopefully just short-term. But the general lack of truly useful communication from upper management is truly frustrating."
good,"I would stack tubs, make boxes, operate pallet jack, give breaks. Some times I would shovel ice, label boxes, sort chicken according to size. Clean tubs or clean the areas needed. I also bagged chicken and trimmed chicken."
good,"For the physical redundent work demanded, not worth the pay, but its a job.  Cold work, some strenuous lifting required in some departments as well.  Turnover rate seemed high.  Not recommended for long term."
good,"I am a maintenance technician work on poultry equipment maintain all equipment do welding, electrical, plumbing, and all that's needs to be done to keep production running"
good,"fast paced place , you could be working more than 12 hours in some days and weekends,benefits are not the greatest ,lack of advancement and management is rude"
good,At times they cut hours and speed up production. They don’t care about there employees well being.  Supervisors are jerks. They won’t promote unless you a kiss *ss
good,The people.  Rules work for some but not all.  Its all about who you know.  People are often rude and managers curse at you making you feel less than.  Its all about getting chicken out the door.  No rotations on the cone lines
good,"as long as you can do the work without hurting yourself or whinging about the conditions, production and slaughter or hides are decent places to work. it pays more than most any other labor job you will find, and I am sure it pays more than any labor job where you will find a mix of immigrant workers who mostly can't speak English, or even speak to each other. where I worked there was something like 70 languages spoken according to the community liaison or chaplain. workplace culture is about showing up every day to do your job in a timely fashion. the hardest part of the job is physical endurance. there is always an exception to the rule, but the vast majority of production jobs at a packing house will rely on repetition of motions that can easily cause repetitive stress injuries. hardest part of most jobs is keeping your knife sharp, the hardest part of saw jobs is keeping pace and keeping correct count while avoiding complacency errors that may result in severe injury. a typical day at work in a Tyson production job involves standing on your feet doing the same task over and over, usually with a knife."
good,"great team, difficult jobs "
good,I was there for almost a year loved working with the people that I worked with enjoy the job the steps that they have in my opinion or not enough sometimes life gets in the way in my case I went through a divorce it's kind of hard to make yourself get up put one foot in front of the other and go to a job even though you know that's how you're going to live but it's hard to do when your heart is broken. I think sometimes in a factory setting you just a body doing a job they don't look at you as a person. I think Tysons needs to implement more steps since life does get in the way sometimes
good,"I love this place, but on any given week you don't know if you are working Saturday until that Friday. it makes it difficult to have a family and spend time with them."
good,I loved working at Tyson however it appeared that my career was stifled and that's why I left to pursue what I thought was a better opportunity. If not for that reason I would have still been working for Tyson.
good,Had our daily huddle to inform the team of what was happening for the night    Supervisors where for the most part good to work with  Hardest part was working in the cold
good,"Nepotism runs wild in this small community several HR problems overlooked for the fear of reprisal. "
good,"If you have a life with kids and a spouse but plan to spend a lot of time with your family then Tyson is not for your,You go in never knowing what time you are going to get off and if there is something serious going on at home and you need to go you are going to get pointed for it no matter how serious the matter is."
good,Its a slow paced environment that takes communication and team work. You have to work in extreme weather conditions at times but over its a adjustable just to work at.
good,Fast paced and not a bad place to work I liked my job I just need a day shift job and I was unable to get moved to days. The job like anywhere else has to get done there is a quota to meet and it is expected to be met by the end of shift
good,Tyson is a profit driven company that requires it's operations to perform at top levels day in and day out in order to meet the demands of customers and shareholders.
good,Was amazing until Hillshire bought Tyson. after that the culture changed.  Came in as in intern and it wasn't what they said it would be after a while.
good,Fair work for a for a wage. Long hours and always working weekends. Supervisors are fair and have to work there way into their positions so there is room for opportunities.
good,"Very diverse culture, Pay advance at your own pace based on company scale, Great work environment, good employees to work with, we were a good team. Very good communication between management and employees."
good,"Schedule is extremely varied, communication between departments is abhorrent. Good pay rate, awesome benefits including good yet cheap insurance, 401k and stock plans."
good,"good people, working hard. "
good,A great place to get your life started. I wouldn't recommend long term stay not many raises or pay changes. I know people that have been at Tyson's over 20 years still making the same pay as the people just getting out of their probationary period and this is the main reason for me looking elsewhere
good,Working in places like this is hard. You have to have a tough skin. I moved up quickly. I worked with great people. There can be a lot of drama if you don't stay out of it
good,I loved it but it was too cold an then half time they didnt want u go bath room when u need to the money was ok an benifits was cool we had hang chicken an pack liver an gizzards an put lables on tubs it was just coldness
good,Company was very understaffed. Crew worked with very old equipment that was constantly breaking down making it impossible to really maintain. Worked 12-14 hour days in difficult conditions.
good,I was filling time with some temp work. But it was very well structured and repetitive. So if you like to expect things ahead of your day then you're set. Their managers did a terrible sales pitch to keep me there.
good,"Day to day was packing and producing sausage. This is a good place for a single individual. I got paid every week, which was good. I had to make sure packaging was up to standard."
good,I really liked working there for Tyson's..... But they don't show that  they care about us and others. They have lots of play time with others.  Mangers need more training classes as well.
good,"A place that will always have available work, compensation is great, however, work/life/balance isn't feasible for anyone who has a family. Good benefits"
good,I was able to learn to operate a few pieces of machinery here so that is helpful. However management is not very employee friendly
good,A typical day at work is usually working to fight the negative attitudes that seem to be everywhere.  I learned a significant amount about appropriate management and motivational styles.  The hardest part of the job is finding positivity.
good,Everything ok is routined which is great but the job can cause sever arthritis due to the low temperature of the departments. Some team members aren't ideal coworkers neither is management.
good,Love the people I worke with at my site but hate dealing with management and their tactic on things they know nothing about. Alot of micromanagement!!
good,I loved working at Tyson a great factory the management was good the experiences alone was wonderful nice environment great benefits
good,High pay and very good benefits. Unfortunately that is where the good things to say about Tyson stop. They have very poor management and employees with poor work ethic.
good,"I typical date at work could racking off pans on and off all day. I learned to have more patience, because if the line breaks down then you will have to work later then normal. Management is challenging. The hardest part of the job is racking off a lot. The most enjoyable of the job is the people."
good,i clean equiment. I work with meat. help make meat products. like hot dogs and other meat products. we work hard to make save quality food. for people to eat.
good,"A Typical day stretching, meeting, Work and once you are done go home.  Emphasize in safety. Physically demanding work. Your Learn about Lean Manufacturing, safety, quality. Management can listen about your concern, but once your concern touch anything affecting their performance is like talking to the wall. Employee with seniority are not appreciated at least to my Supervisor.  The most enjoyable part of my work is the product giveaway.  The employee appreciation day."
good,"Woke up early to go to Tyson, stinks very bad. I've learned how to pack product and cut meat. "
good,not willing to share or review my employment with this company at this time. I am not willing to review this company even when I resign.
good,"I have to be at work ever day"
good,"Tyson cut hours, fails to pay for overtime and neglects injured employee. The knowledge of some managers are definitely lacking in several areas."
good,"guaranteed 9-10 hour shift each day, fast paced tally work, I learned to memorize codes and lots of numbers in association with the handheld and the loads that were to be shipped. The benefits are excellent however the management is terrible and the department operated poorly as a team. The most enjoyable part of the job was working closely with the few others who took the job as seriously as I did."
good,Good employee's with great attitudes and a will to learn. The hardest part of this job was getting management to trust that you can do a good job on work tasks.
good,drop misc chuck product into boxes and sent to box sealer. put label on boxes made sure right product was in box.also made sure you worked with proper safety gear at all times.
good,Being a floater was a busy job you always doing something you was never bored or never had nothing to do.  I was from packing the birds to doing the scales to making boxes.
good,"Unfortunately my HR Manager was passive aggressive and unwilling  to encourage team member strengths; only focused on weaknesses. However, the training I received was excellent, the relationships I built were lasting and I learned so much. I believe the organization in itself is amazing and would be willing to work for Tyson again under different management."
good,Okay Pay horrible management. The hours are long some job duties were impossible to do on your shift. THe pay could have been more for the amount of work we were doing.
good,I learned most of my skills at Tyson Foods and have exercised everything I have learned. Management is okay and most of my co-workers and I have no issues. The hardest part of the job is the hours.
good,"It has been a great place to start my journey to my career goal. Don't see myself staying here and advancing.  I have learned alot through Tyson. I have become good at troubleshooting mechanically, pnuematically, hydraulicaly and some electrically."
good,"Tyson foods have a lot of over time available. The benefits are great, during my time working there I met some really nice people. the hardest part of the job was dealing with the cold weather."
good,"i get to work and set the desk the way i want it, go make coffee, get a deadline sheet ready and print off 3 copies. then get what orders are there for me checked so the numbers match and if the truck is ready for a manifest and seals and get billed ot if it is only partially loaded, if it is ready then i make sure the numbers on the stacker sheet match the manifest for what is loaded. then send seals and manifest out to teuck and bill cutomer. if a partial  again make sure numbers maktch but send 1 seal out to lock until it can be finished"
good,Overall a good job but the hours were not very family friendly
good,"Before I give a review on my job, I would like to say that SAFETY is the most important thing to me when performing any task on any job. I want to leave work everyday the same way I came and that is with all of my limbs still intact and everyone else around me the same way. I like my job, I don't hate going to work everyday. The guys I work with are all pretty much down to earth and don't mind training you. I work in the hottest and nastiest part of the plant. The summers are very hot, but I'm used to working in all types of weather conditions.The most enjoyable part of my job is fixing or rebuilding something and watching it operate correctly. I don't plan on working at Tyson for the rest of my life, but I am gaining plenty of experience."
good,"Worked hard, made a profit for the company,  hardest part of the job was working 14 hours a day 6 or 7 days a week. Most enjoyable was seeing the results of a hard days work."
good,"its a good starter job with no rtaises , saftey was there number one concern"
good,"chargement du camion "
good,This unit of Tyson is great to work for because of the wonderful people who put so much effort into making McDonalds product
good,"Productions on a daily basis, learn to operate different machines on the plant. The hardest part is stand in the cold area for 8 full hours. Good part, competition among the departments on the productions."
good,"The pay was good. the slave conditions however were bad. I was told  many days that i would have to wait to use the bathroom, some days i waited at least an hour. If you walk off the line and go without permission you could be terminated."
good,"I have to say thank you Tyson Foods for giving me a start in a great career. most of the guys I worked with were good guys, Like most places you have those that are lazy."
good,Tyson food inc is a great place to work for . it is well managed and the people who work for the employer are very helpful it also is a great place for advancement they have plenty of benefits and paid vacation and training.
good,"A typical day of consists of constant movement, great exercise it was but the high demand for production would attempt to invoke stress.  I learned that you have to be yourself, stay humble, but at the same time stand your ground so others do not run over you."
good,A typical day at was cold and long. I learned how to marinate meat and pack out. Most of the co-workers were friendly but some not so much. The hardest part of the job was making sure the meat was marinated the right way.
good,i would work there again only because of the pay. the job wasn't that bad it was just the way you were treated. the other employees were easy to work with.
good,"worked in a very cold climate trimming chicken breast. The people/managers were good people, but the job could get very stressful at times. The pay was good enough to help me take care of my children."
good,Theres not much room to grow at Tysons. Little or no room to move up in career position. They make it very hard to work full time.
good,it's an okay place to work. stock purchuse plan is really good. always made money on tyson stock.
good,Management staff was not treated with respect. If problems occured out of the floor upper management would blow their tops and wouldnt try to help solve the problem in hand.
good,"Fast pace cold an wet on the floor, work pay varies an is normaly in the middle of nowhere. However its a company that is worth appling for."
good,"Typical day at work is 10-16 hrs, Mon-Sat and some Sundays. NO work/life balance at all."
good,"The company was in a constant state of change.  I moved my desk 6 times in 5 years and always had concerns regarding the next reorganization, where people lost there jobs each time.  I somehow managed to survive and only left the company after they decide not to let people in our office work remote anymore.  My role went from being prominent and managing software delivery changes to a somewhat mundane admin role.  It was great money though so I didn't complain, but certainly wasn't challenged."
good,Tyson is an alright job. The jobs there are often repetitive and constantly do the same motions thruout the night. Once you get the motions down for your job and get quicker the job that is assigned to you will be come easy. Tyson's jobs aren't hard and the most enjoyable part of the job is just to appreciate you have a job.
good,I trimmed chicken at Tyson for a couple of months....my experience was good overall.. as I said it was only for a couple of months so I don't have much of a  review.
good,"The have a lot of great position that if you applied for it you can get hired, they respect everyone,they don’t really care about race or color, it’s still a great company for people to work..."
good,This job was very hard on my body..standing in one place for 10 hours a day. The good thing about this job is you get every weekend off to be worh your family.
good,The job is good over all but management fights against you instead of helping you succeed such not getting the parts needed to fix your matching so therefore you look pride in your work and loose interest on your job.
good,"This is a good job and people seem to stay here for awhile. The hours are good and helpful doing twelve hour shifts. The only downside is working in the cold. Even though we have suits, it is still freezing"
good,I'm trying to find a better job with opportunity to help provide for my family. My current job alright for the time being but I would love to have more.
good,"Management wait to call maintenance when machinery is runni ng bad. Then when they dont get their quota , they try to blame the operator, like its their fault."
good,There have been recent management changes over the last year and it has been nothing but a pain to everyone that has been here for over the last 3 years or longer. The work loads are not much of a problem as long as the operators are being trained properly. Management has on more then one occasion stepped on everyones toes with that specific issue. Our last meeting as a plant felt like the aftermath was just pure unappreciative of all the workers. Policy changes are completely against the workers and has no appreciation for the hard work of most of the plants hardest workers. I used to feel appreciated for all of my efforts and now i just feel dread and depression.
good,"Imperial, the company inside Tyson i worked for was OK. They were pretty flexible with hours when needed. Management was not very supportive but the staff worked well together. all though they did have a high turn over rate. they eventually lost their contract with Tyson."
good,"During my tenure with Tyson's, I've met some hard working, decent people.  The job itself is straight forward, and the management staff are reasonable and fair.  I would recommend Tyson's as a good place to re-enter the work force."
good,The bad thing about tysonfoods where to get to your department u had to walk outside in the elements at the back of the building to get in your department.
good,you'll pretty much be doing any job in the plant at any given time no matter what your hired to do the areas are cold in the winter n blistering in the summer if you can deal with this you'll be fine
good,I worked well when i was with this company it was worth the money I got to meet a lot of good people and the management were very good people just a few things i would change.
good,I liked the job but the location was far to commute to an from home with the family at the time but if ever given another chance of opportunity ever were to present itself I would definitely work there again. And I have always recommended this as a top paying job available for anyone looking to work
good,I liked the experience overall nice company I just think it's time for something  new but I really did enjoy the environment and the people i worked with
good,Tyson is a good company to work for. Their training process could use some improvement. I worked there 13 years and received 4 promotions. They are a little inconsistent in corrective actions.
good,"Ok for beginners not many opportunities to advance. Hard work, good work culture as you progress in the company. Options to move around to different locations if needed"
good,good place to work! Not the type of work I was looking to honestly! But no complaint at all great benefits & plus you get them right away the only bad thing you don’t get holidays off
good,Stable employment with no advancement opportunity. Management was good. Working environment was difficult. Working with heights on equipment and breathing in dust from feed mill.
good,.hard work and dedication. Not full filling. No communication. Felt left out as a supervisor. Tm would know about changes before you would. Very flighty company.
good,"Tyson didn't really stand out too much to me. The majority of my year spent there was as expected: get to work on time, do your job, get your money, go home. The major downsides were the fact you don't get any paid time off until a full year of employment, but their starting pay and other insurance/benefits were fair. The work itself was pretty tiring however, often coming home exhausted."
good,I   learned working at tyson chicken is not so bad i learned how to do everything to a chicken i need to do from cleaning the chicken a holding it the proper way
good,"A typical work day was a day that included team effort, cleanliness, and staying motivated to complete the work on time.  Management wasn't bad at all, they were helpful when the team was short on workers.  The culture was easy to adapt to.  It was fun having different conversations with people of different ethnic backgrounds.  The hardest part of the job was getting past the heat."
good,It was hard work and fast paced I learned that you gotta keep working in order to achieve what you need in life from this job. Long hours good pay and decent benefits.
good,The pay rate really sucked when I was working there. I have since heard that everyone/every department has since gotten a raise and way better monies for their job performance. You start early and get done at a pretty nice time. The staff is cool and management is alright as well.
good,Working for Tyson is a great experience and way to help you pay bills and Learn different jobs to do they have good benefits and allow you to be off on holidays with pay
good,"not a bad company to work for, pays good. management is friendly and normal business hours. worked some saturdays. overall internship went very well. would work for them again."
good,Management team could do better to appear to care about their team members. Appreciation was never felt by the management team which does not encourage someone to continue to work for the company. Other than that the job was great. The money is excellent and you get plenty of time with your family.
good,"working on assembly line grinding up meat in a grinding machine . package the product and get ready for shipping . great working place , great pay  and working as a team ."
good,Didn’t make much money. The work culture was good. If it wasn’t for me moving I still would work there. It was a lot of opportunity for moving up within the the company
good,It’s good here but it could be better some conditions of the place could be better they should add paid maternity leave or make conditions better for pregnant women who wanna work
good,"In all Tyson was a decent place to work. It is cold there which made it difficult to work sometimes. Sometimes it was fast pace sometimes it was slow, depending on who you are working with. We had a good boss, he was fair and if we had a problem he took care of it. The pay was good and we got decent amount of hours per week plus overtime sometimes."
good,Tyson tried to provide entertainment to keep employees wanting to come to work. They would often have bands come play and encouraged employees to utilize their musical talents.
good,"lots of work, no reward for it.  the company demands to work weekends and holidays and gives nothing in return.  no comp time, no money, no nothing..................................................................."
good,"If you want good pay and benefits for entry level work, heres your sign."
good,It was ok the hours were poor working late nights away from my kids. I tried to het moved to first shift but it took to long..in i had done pointed out.
good,It was a good work experience the job of being a shoulder cutter was a tough job at first but it became easier the more I did the job. I liked and respected all my coworkers they often helped whenever I  needed assistance.
good,I worked in the frozen food area and it was very cold but they would not allow me to transfer to a warmer area. I worked putting frozen chicken into plastic bags and it made my hands so cold that my hands were hurting all day long.
good,good place to work I really enjoyed it I really desire to return to work for Tyson foods in the future. It's a great place to work with a lot of potential to grow
good,Tysons foods is a good job and excellent pay the distance just wasn't working out for me I live to far away but other than that it is an awesome job to have.
good,Room for advancement with hard work and dedication.  Fast paced environment.  Competitive compensation and good work family.  Good benefits. Long hours
good,A decent job with good benefits.. Very good place to learn from a agricultural standpoint and business as well.. You get paid every week. And will have the opportunity to get as much overtime as you can work..
good,"A good place to work but the plant is closed, so no one will be hired there. Tyson was a god company to work for. That  is really about it. Nothing more to say."
good,"Great"
good,"I had to bag meat, box them and many other thing including raw meat. "
good,Tyson foods is a fast pace work environment sometimes very stressful but overall it is a good place to work pay is good people are very nice supervisor are sometime rude but understand how stress being a supervisor is
good,the labor is intense from the first day on the floor at case ready plants they do put alot of time into making you understand the safety accepts of your job there are great programs to help get a diploma or high school equivalent  as well as second language training
good,"I was a hard worker & loved it there just thought I was moving great pay great benefits definitely a change not a difficult job .. supervisor was ok,.........................."
good,Flexible hours and summer hours but old school mentality. Love the people and location. General management focused within marketing. Really bad benefits
good,"A typical day at Tyson could consists of just about anything, depending on who you're working with and whatever shift you are working. The day shifts don't really have to put up with much because no one will usually try anything out of the ordinary during the day time, but the second shifts is the time that you should always look out for everyone around you. Make sure that you keep an eye out no matter who it is, because during the night shifts is when things would usually get a little out of hand."
good,"I worked 4 years  at Tyson and I have miltary experience and technical school certified in welding and truck driving.beware buddy system & run🏇🏿If you know someone you can move up, if you don’t move out😘"
good,None..none..none.dont know what else to say but i have no recommendations for this chicken plant but that its very stressful and confusing most nights
good,"Not a good place to work if you are looking for job advancement, but it is a good place to get experience for your next job. It is a place your copping skills will be tested."
good,Okay job...a lot of hours including weekend so you don't have much free time but good overtime hours..but have no choice in doing them...so overall it's a okay job with good pay
good,"I liked working there driving the forklift and the jack. I loved working with the other employees, they where good people to work with and talk to when you have a bad day."
good,Very good place to work really nice employees really nice supervisor excellent hours with plenty overtime available first and second shift available..
good,"They don’t pay you nearly Enough for the work they expect you to produce, also they like to wait 8 hours into your shift to tell you you’ll have to work a double not cool"
good,The company is growing and very big. I do not actually work for Tyson I am employed by advantage solutions they are our client. They care about there employees and are always there to help
good,"A typical day at work for me was long. I did multiple things around our inventory control and enterprise inventory management departments. I helped in fixing a new SAP system during its rollout and trained management on it at plants. I really enjoyed working for all my team leads and managers. The workplace culture was summed up well in the phrase ""we don't leave til the work is done"" which is something that I'll definitely take with me. The hardest part of the job was the travelling. I was away from home 75% of the time and some times even more. But the most enjoyable thing was being able to have such a large contribution to a large and well known corporation."
good,Tyson is a huge company. Plenty of opportunity to move up and make good money.very dependable job. Good people to work with. Also opportunity to advance education through the job
good,"processing work orders daily "
good,"Fast pace, too many people trying to play top dog, and to much drama, and always short staffed.Never ran a line with right amount of people,and ran normal speed with less people"
good,Tyson Food is a fast-paced company great benefits great salary great atmosphere to work I would recommend it to friends and family if I had the opportunity yes I will work at Tyson again
good,"long"
good,"Weekly pay, sometimes get raises"
good,Tyson is an ok place to work if you like working in the cold and don’t mind it. I just think they need more people to speak English and not to just throw you somewhere and expect you to learn within an hr of working.
good,"Jobs available for All!!  great place to work. but when employees do not come to work, work hours and job may change because lack of attendance, Summary: Great place to work"
good,Place has been closed for some time.You learn how to work in both heated and cool departments.You learn what to look for in quality control.You learn to work in a rather fast enviroment.
good,Tyson you can alot about it it different things going on a very big bussiness across the country and even the world this job ain't for anybody but if you like good money why not come and work for that good money
good,Great work place. Great management. The work schedule itself is very to hard to deal with since I started very early in the morning and would find lots of trouble having to wake up for work everyday day on time
good,Indexing Hogs. 1 Hog Per Dog. Operating Control Board And Pulling Hogs Down Rail. Job Was Physically Demanding And Either Very Hot Or Very Cold. Management Was Very Friendly.
good,Great place to work at if you don’t mind a fast pace environment great time off great benefits flexible work schedule most weekends off most holidays off
good,"Counting, hunting batches, shipping and recieving, loading and unloading trailer,  know the trailer #. Taking in information and getting it to the  corrected department"
good,i liked working at Tyson. We’ll be relocating to Texas for my husband. He’s graduating from Friends University in May so we’re trying to find jobs in Texas for him to get better job offers
good,"Good place to work if you don’t have a family and just care about the money. Middle management is good blue collar workers like the rest of us, upper management doesn’t care much for the individual just the overall job of the shift."
good,"A large staff were paid well for basic work.  "
good,Going to work at Tyson for was for very hard for the last three years but I manage to keep going in every morning because I have things they need paying for life it's free!
good,"great benefits pay depends on the manager, there is a standard however. you must be a part of the clique to advance after a certain point. which conflicts with what the company values are."
good,"Job was good while I was there. The people aren't bad. Do you're job and you will be okay. The work environment however, was a little hard to adjust to."
good,"long hours and long days. a lot of weekend work, most teams were good along with some upper managent. I would not work there again it was tough in the end"
good,Stacked boxes all night for 12 hours. Didn’t want to give you your raise. No payed vacation plus you had to pay for your food there. It could be a better place if they could get everything running the correct way.
good,It Was OK. There were pros & cons. Long breaks. Easy going. Production. Some people could have been a little more courteous. It was some good weekly pay.
good,They have a bunch of dispatchers that lie to drivers now. The good dispatchers are gone. I worked there for 4 years. Made good money the first 2 and a half years then i had a new dispatcher  and lost 20 thousand a year running under him. Kllm driver wanted my load and dispatch told me to give them my load  and take their load .I said no and driver manager got involved and told him no and quit .A driver can only go as high as the driver manager. That is wrong because they support the dispatcher.the dispatcher lies and the driver manager supports dispatch. What a circus. Glad I don't work there anymore
good,"Everyone has their opinion, but the job was easy, and very cold. I would love to go back, but when fired I was told I wasn't healthy because I had my BC removed."
good,Good job for someone just starting to work and getting out of high school. Great people there that will help you with anything including outside of work.
good,Depending on the area of the plant that you get put in will determine if it's too hard for you or too easy for you and we will find you something that will fit you and your emviormentand your pase
good,Management is not the best. Daily routine consists of Checking and maintaining and keeping continues production going.  Must be able to work well and communicate.
good,"Typical day at work included; cold but fun, labeling and processing chicken, scale chicken legs, and most of other workers were enjoyable to work with."
good,I was only there temporarily to help pay bills during the slow season when are construction jobs slowed up and we didn't have very much work and I wasn't able to pay my bills and started falling behind
good,Tyson for me was hard  work as a inspector helper it was a  big responsibility to work fast paced  making sure I mark the proper symbol clean and gutted chicken .
good,while i was working for tyson foods in sedalia i enjoyed working as a team and having any issues dealed with accordingly so overall the employer was ok
good,"Only work for Tyson about 15 months to transition accounting system from Advance Pierre to Tyson. Not much help from Tyson only had 3-4 visit on site.  Not very accessible during transition. Never had the chance to train anyone on our daily duties, still had not hired staff.  Finally train managers and sent the SOP on daily duties."
good,It was a good place to work and still is but the pay does need to go up because the cost of living has gone up for most. the team members felt and still feel like family.
good,They had me on cone line i HATE it.Some of the people was hateful and mean. They don't care for others all for them self and to many groups and 'manger friends'
good,Tyson bought the company I worked for and phased my department out. i cannot give an impartial/unbiased view of the company due to the environment I was working in during the end of my run there.
good,"The work was easy, but the breaks were cut short due to having to be back on the ten minute mark. The pay was ok and the hours were good. Management was very full of themselfs."
good,Not a bad place to work got along with everyone. The job is very fast paced depending where you are in the department.  In the SUMMER & WINTER it gets very hot & cold in the plant
good,"Fun experience,good job ,enjoyed it, certified forklift driver warehous..frozen shipping ,stacking ,warhousing.,good job and I enjoyed it I enjoyed just about all my jobs and love learning something new"
good,this was a good place to work great driving partner good hours and pay customers was friendly and always good to talk to will unloading the hardest part of the job was waiting
good,working at tyson was enjoyable in some ways like i met a huge diverse group of people and made good friends with most of them and still am friends till this day.
good,Great culture. Team members are great. Management and employees care about the company. Decent benefits. Most enjoyable part of the job is the people.
good,"I was privileged to work for Tyson under management who valued people.  Unfortunately, those managers are gone, and the company and culture is less than it was.."
good,Its a job that you can learn different things..you have to work hard and cry long hours.6thou work with all different types of people there its not hard to learn the jobs.you will work ...you never no when your getting off unless you work 1st shift...
good,"The company is very categorized and department heads or division heads are very territorial.  Promotions depend on political views, actions and social skills with other upper managers."
good,I like my job at tyson..but i think at continal tire i will have many opportunity..i been at tyson 13 years n counting..tyson is a good company to work for but cant move up at tyson
good,Tyson was a very fast pace and highly productive company. It required long and challenging hours consisting of 13-16 hours as a Supervisor. The company set up safety classes to keep safety awareness alive within the environment. They did have programs to recognize individual progress as an employee. My personal reasoning for leaving was to complete my ministry studies and acquire my ordination. Overall Tyson was a good place to work for with great benefits.
good,"It was a good place to work at. The only thing that needs to be in effect there is how to treat team members. Tyson has to show more respect to there team members, other than that it's a great place."
good,"they could treat their employees better, the environment is very messy including managers, and its all about who you know; but the pay is good and you get incentives"
good,"Very results oriented company that continues to look for ways to add responsibility and possibly cut headcount where possible. A very serious and lack of fun environment."
good,I would go back but catch chickens is a very hard job ..catch 9 to 11 chickens is hard but we'll worth it when u see your check and you get to help feed people by catching the chickens
good,"its a production line with pepperoni on third shift very fast pace. There is some slicing into the pepperoni to take of the wrapper, but that is very easier, but again you have to be fast."
good,"2nd shift is much more realxing but you are alwasy short handed of people. 1st shift is more pressure. People are good, Management is good (depends on who you have)."
good,Ok to work..bakery is to hot not not have better air conditioning....strict 90 day attendance policy...worked 12hrs 2 2 3 should be broken down into 8hrs due to heat
good,It was an okay experience. The main thing was that it was every week pay. The managers weren’t really professional and neither was the staff. It was a small town so there were a lot of nosy people
good,"Overall positive experience until Dawson plant burned down and I was transferred to Vienna.  Since arrival, they have not found a good fit for my particular skills and I have felt like the proverbial 5th wheel."
good,American people have it really hard out there in some departments for money it’s great but the stress that you put up with ain’t worth it..............
good,"It's an ok place to work if you are just needing a job.  If you are looking for advancement in a career, this is not the place.  They seem to like to hire people that are completely satisfied with general labor."
good,"You clock in, and perform your daily work out. It took about 10 min of working out and stretching before you can begin your shift.. This job was very fast paced at times. They really needed you in the spot. The supervisors were always very willing to teach you the proper ways to perform certain job tasks. Mostly friendly environment and always the willingness to help your fellow co-worker."
good,"Vast portfolio of brands, but dedicated people in various departments: Marketing, Insights, Sales, Analytics.  Sometimes overstretched on projects and objective gets lost."
good,"worked a lot of hours, breaks are way to short. long way to walk just to smoke. the point system is messed up. pay was great, but worked way to many hours you don't have a life at home when you take a job at Tysons."
good,Shift i had was great but under paid as a tech for this area. Also in addition the new policy on attendance had change for the worst. Some of my benefits had been taken away.
good,"Its a great place to work. Meanwhile, you must be able to meed the FDA approval of the food guidelines. Last but not least, if you cannot handel the smell of chicken this is not the place for you."
good,"I have learn how they put the chicken on the lines to run into another line for pack off, U do have good days and enjoying working there.There no hard part of the job when u only just packing meat and put it in the boxes to be ship.The most enjoyable part of a job is when your work is done, its time to go home when your shift is over with."
good,good salary.  sometimes long hours.  good management.  a very clean processing plant that focused on putting out a quality product.  I would recommend Tyson Inc.  in the future.
good,a great paying job there is a lot of favor for personal reason rather than skill and education. the way i see it the room for advancement can happen in time
good,It's stressful and action packed. Never get a chance to breathe. And lots of blood and guys flying everywhere. People are to themselves. And they over work you with little care at all
good,"Triage work and personal injuries, workers comp , ergonomics and 2500 employess never a dull moment at tyson, met and made a lot of good friends . My favorite nursing job ever."
good,"Fast paced environment, good if you can handle to poultry processing and need a job. Different shifts are offered with incentives, as well as different areas."
good,"It's a good place to work and decent people. The hours are good, although sometimes they give late notice for mandatory weekends. They value their employees so overall a great place."
good,"I was not there long enough to form a good opinion. I did not like being in a slaughter house environment. The staff was okay, but I had a problem with the outside conditions with having all manner of carrion seeking out the remains of chickens after they were slaughtered."
good,We go to work to make a living to provide for our families. To achieve the best of the job. To better the company. Working as teammates and encouraging each other to do great.
good,You will need to be able to keep up with fast paced line work. Expect to be in a lot of pain. And expect to have a supervisor that doesn't care. Always come early to your line if you are late by 2 minutes you get written up.
good,Nice place to work got along with everyone. Manager where cool I hated they closed.a good thing about working here was I didn’t have to smell the chicken as they were killed on the side I worked.
good,Some managers are rude and disrespectful to the employees and they threaten your employment if you try to talk with any management higher than their rank
good,"The company treat people with dignity and allows to grow, I have learned so much experiences but the best of all is diversity and customer services. Being a team's player is what I have taken seriously."
good,"On a typical work day at Tyson it can be a very difficult job. I had to pack meat, grade and make boxes. It was a good place of employment, and I kind of miss it."
good,Got to become a mechanic with no experience at all so great opportunities. Also there are great people working there. And it was great to see the whole process the meat goes threw.
good,"Good place to work, but could be better."
good,The jobs are fast paced. Management doesn't seem to want to listen to suggestions. Long hours and work week. Good insurance. If you got overtime the paycheck was pretty good.
good,"shutdown and start ups, pm on weekends assits production supervisors with any problems that goes on that has something to do with refrigeration, and work on boilers"
good,"100 mph 9 hrs. a day. very messy with lots of blood. You stared at the bell, and ran until the F.D.A decided to go to break . The at the end of the shift you didn't know when you were going to finish, there was about a 45 minute window there"
good,"Worked a production line, several different types of production lines.  There isn't enough information available to give to you about working there.  It was cold."
good,Very challenging place to work. Love the friendliness of most of the employees. Certain advancement opportunities. Family oriented and the upper managment takes time to get to know their employees by greeting you with a handshake at the door and having random events.
good,Stressful job environment due to facility upgrade. Continuous change and training new people. Corporate information trickled down to my level and I had to interpret the company's needs.
good,Daily reporting on production and inventory levels in addition to ad-hoc reporting as needed/requested.  Friendly environment in spite of the fast pace.
good,It’s nice to think about new job and meet new work team and learning new skills. And may be have better salary to cover all my and my family needs. Thanks
good,Working at Tyson is fast pace and very competitive if you trying to move up. The pay is good but you don't really have time to spend with your family. It would be a great place to work if the supervisor really cared about the job
good,"It's as if Hillshire bought Tyson.  Tyson had some great leaders and a culture that was business-focused, productive, profitable, but also caring."
good,it was cold and my feet would get wet. i was not trained well enough. the management did do a good job though. the orientation was a week and we watched a lot of videos.
good,Do whats rite and you will be alright. A willingness to learn and hustle. Training classes are very oriented. If you show up for classes and work you will do just fine.
good,It's ok job once you get you body in the condition of the position that you are doing but once you been there so long you can put in for a different position
good,"The company in a good job for a person to provide for there family, You can take good care of your children to achieves a lot of opportunity to advancement for the family"
good,"I covered a huge geographic area, and managed several facilties. Job required constant travel with an office in Fort worth, TX as well as an office in South Carolina."
good,The reason it was stressful was because you worked all the time and the machines had to be spotless or we would get shut down by the food services. It felt like I was always being rushed when cleaning. They were always worried about there start up time.
good,working for Tysons was a great experience .the thought  getting up and making sure product was sent out was amazing to me.the simple thought of feeding people was a big help to society.i really liked the work but some of the upper management wasn't fair to the production people.
good,Needs help with management what tome 2nd shift gets off and weekends off not enough time for break work to many hours just to have one break just help
good,"I love my job but I must say that their is so much favoritism at my facility.."
good,"It is always a chalenge, but that is what kepps you motivated. At any time things change, but that keeps learnig and knowledge is a key point. I always strive to get as much knowlege to keep up with the growing work. The most inpornt part of my job is to build relationships and get them to hsve trust in every desion i make. Atipical day at work envolves keeping up with my employees and they venders that come in, also keeping up with all the paperwork to make sure they get paid, also to make sue Tyson does not lose money and keep the plant running the best that i can."
good,"Was in internship so I learned a lot. Programmed in Progress, C++, and C#. Their culture is business casual. I would recommend any student to search for internships there."
good,Show up and work. They are flexible when you have something unplanned come up. Such as family problems.  Quartly raises are nice. But you have yo be a fast learner to keep up.
good,"I had to open ingredients,and put them in a mixer. I had to also write down how much meat, and ingredients and check the temperature of meat and ingredients in the mixer. I also had to check the metal detector to see if it is working right every hour."
good,"Tyson was a great company to work. Everyone got along well. You always had help with your work. Management was very fair. After evaluations, you could get a raise."
good,Tyson will set you on the right path. Due to the low pay and bad management most people get all the training they can and move on to better paying jobs.
good,Best factory job around the area. There's a lot of jobs to choose from and few of those jobs have good incentive programs that make them top pay factory positions around the area.
good,The hardest part of the job is dealing with the team members as they are of a different culture and lots of Spanish speaking employees who speak no English.
good,"I would go to work as normal and sometimes the orders be wrong and I would have to correct them before I can start another load to put on the truck. Sometimes Trucks come in late to where as I don't get off at a set time. I would get off hours after my shift end. Sometimes I would not have a day off but I still made sure my work was done before I left. "
good,"Its a good place to work, you have to bid for the shift that works best for you, "
good,good hours and good pay good management the culture was really diverse which made the job not fun the hardest part of the job was getting along with the people
good,Tysons isn’t a bad place to work. It’s just that sometimes they treat their employees like they are replaceable. I worked both on a line in production and in shipping and receiving.
good,"This place is very very fast-paced and if you cannot handle that, then this is not the place for you.Working environment is fine, employees are great people. The work is hard, but that is to be expected from a factory."
good,It was a hard job to accomplished with limited resources where production goals were placed on top of making changes to better the situation. Jobs needed to be evaluated but only one person allowed to do it and she did not know how to perform a day's work.
good,"Pre-operation Inspection, prepared and tested sanitizer for proper strength with Titration kit.  calibrated thermometers. collected samples for lab.  Monitored work area and team members for safety and sanitation as well as PPE. Preformed hourly audits for proper weights and information, audited packaging and cases for proper product and label information.  Report any and all deficiencies to Department Supervisor and Quality Assurance supervisor.  Perform SOP inspections on a timely schedule.  I learned the importance if checking product and the plow of food to insure the client receives the best quality product possible.  The hardest part of the job was getting samples from every combo and pallet.  The most enjoyable part of the job was my co-workers."
good,"HR  personal uneducated, have no idea how to run HR. VERY BAD OPERATION. They need to be educated. they came from the floor. slept there way to HR all 3 of them"
good,This was a good starter job for people with little experience. One can learn a lot from this place. Because your both a mechanic and electrician. This is a bacon processing plant so there is pork fat all over everything.
good,"Great environment and great workers "
good,The organization was fine.  I worked the graveyard shift which made it difficult for me to go to school in this country and advance myself educationally.
good,This was not an environment I would have made a career. I worked in a freezing cooler and performed very physical work with low pay and benefits. I also had to travel about an hour to get to work.
good,"very fast paste working to use knifes, and different type of equipment on the floor, have to be good at sharpening your knifes and cut product the wright way."
good,Se trabaja bien en equipo y pagan muy bien y el horario perfecto
good,"Unappreciative of employees, hiring associates suck, training is stressful if you don't already have experience, needs inprovement in human resource area"
good,"Great supervisor. Great Training.Had a Credit union. Had a great break area and nusre station.  Great staff. "
good,It was an ok place to work.  I enjoyed the people i worked with.  The atmosphere took some getting used to.  I would recommend working for them only if you look into what the job consists of before applying.
good,"Certain employees get away with being lazy and leave the work for the other employees, which causes the good employees to seek employment elsewhere. Pay is below the norm."
good,A typical at Tyson Food is loud and crowd we do not have enough supplies to get started to work. The management treat the employees like we are in high school. The hardest part of my job is that i don't have a specific place where I work. The best part of my day is going home and seeing my daughters.
good,As a Supervisor i learn different types of cultures and nationality. Everyone was treated the same. Learn how to make money for the company in a safe but fast pase and did that rill well.
good,Okay place to work....maintenance area was not a good place to have a shop due to the heat and the welding facilities were not very handy.  Good management and coworkers though.
good,If not for poor management it would have been a great place and I would have been a great place to stay. The pay was good but the mangment was extremely poor.
good,the employees are courteous. the work is fast paced which I didn't mind. tbh I wish I hadn't left. good job security. its a good place for a hard worker
good,the hardest part of the job was having my hands tied and not being able to speak my mind. that is the guards not Tyson. Tyson was fun. had no problems
good,Fun and inviting place to work but does not provide the best pay. The benefits make up for a little bit of the low pay. Typical Food production plant.
good,This is your typical food plant. The work environment is fun and the management is easy to work with. The pay is not the best but it is better than nothing.
good,It was freezing cold inside. Good benefits. Pay should be more considering the temperature you have to work in. Cleana and well organized place. Management needs work.
good,Its a good steady job but very limited opportunity for job growth. They typically promote from the corporate level. Male centric at the management level.
good,"workplace culture is something to get used to. Very loud environment. Cold most of the time, scarce bathroom breaks, also, attentive and strict managers."
good,"I personally felt the company did not have my best interest at heart.I worked long hours, but was never compensated appropriately. The people had great personalities, positive atmosphere."
good,Good job but a lot of drama and not enough hard working people if the supervisor pay more attention to whos working mayb people wouldn't quit as often.
good,me gusta trabajar aquí buen ambiente y posibilidades de crecimiento
good,Working 3rd Shift there on sanitation team was fun to see the difference processing machines. Was long hours lots of overtime. Great coworkers some management is good.
good,"It became too cold for me work to the best of my ability, but it was a good job. They gave me two pay raises. And paid me while I was sick. But there was no way out of the cold."
good,Loved it there. Good people good management. Pay was great. The commute was kind of bad but still worth it. Would recommend anyone to try the place out.
good,the hours were difficult to work around as far as personal time. a typical day at work included a lot of disagreement between coworkers. people there are very hateful toward each other. culture there was very diverse. the hardest part of my job was trying to get through the day without someone arguing with you. the most enjoyable part of my job was when i got my breaks.
good,It was all right until they wanted us to work 6 days of the week and not get tire. The do pay well though and the benefits are good. Your managers there are pretty much hit and miss.
good,"I don't mind working for the company Tyson Foods, the management at the plant I work for is horrible.  The Leads do not get enough credit for their work neither"
good,"There is nothing to tell, wanna know what is like go work there. this is crazy that I have to fill this out.  I HAVE NOTHING TO SAY ABOUT THE COMPANY."
good,very fast paced enviroment with little chance of advancement. very hot in the summer and liveable in the winter. not recommended for just any job hunter.
good,The hardest part of the job is being able to handle the cold and staff the lines because they can get 14 pts for absentee. Most of the employees are family
good,it was a good easy job. the hours were nice and the sunshine pay was the best. did not intend to leave but some personal things came up. overall it was a pretty good job.
good,"In general I would give them  70 % they need to improve the consistency of their organzation and the implementation of real quality world wide standards"
good,This is a fast paced production job.  It is a good job for people who enjoy a face paced job.  They have pretty decent benefits as well.  The pay was good.
good,It a good place to work at.I enjoyed working there but management have favoritism.I know because i have experience it.The job is not hard at all life is.
good,this facility is always under going reorganization so your job was not secured from time to time but they expected you to be available whenever they needed you
good,This job was going very well until it got into the slow seasons which resulted in being sent home 2 times a week according to seniority. hours got very short forcing me to seek better employment.
good,Fast paced environment with non traditional working hours. Many days started before the sun came up and did not end until the sun went down. Very little respect for personal time outside of work.
good,The work at Tyson Food can be very stressful. It was extremely hard on my hands. I was a tender cutter. I used a knife for four hours a day. I had carpal surgery on my right hand. I also used scissors for the other four hours.
good,"There was good and bad times at Tyson Foods.  Some where their just to make a check, while others just employeed you.  It was a vary bad injury to my back that made me live."
good,"The work at Tyson Foods is very strenuous. I worked in debone, where we remove the bones from the chicken. The conveyer moves your entire shift, besides lunch and break."
good,I enjoyed working there it was just a odd job I never dealt with working with parts of a animal but I liked it the pay were great and the staff was good to all people.
good,"Tyson is a place that I will refer to only individuals who are seeking serious employment. Local area or far away,  Tyson is a place of unsafe equipment and supplies no good insurance for workers comp."
good,This was a fast paced production not that I minded but the treatment there was poor. The chicken was not always up to standards but unfortunately this job tended to look past that in order to get there bonus money. Overall only the pay was good if you was willing to put up with alot
good,Es un trabajo ke esta bajo mucha presion y no hay ora de comida
good,Tyson is  a growing industry and offers many opportunity's. The hardest part of the job is the long hours on your feet. There are many different cultures of people at Tyson. The management are very helpful and caring.
good,"I maintained my system almost perfectly. I kept systems clean and running in a safe environment. I worked night shift, and a lot of times had to help maintenance both sides of the plant. I would help whenever needed."
good,Enjoyable workplace with good management. Learned many new skills from the HACCP department. Learned to work with the handheld piolet computer. Fun working with people to keep everything under control.
good,"A typical day at work was spending a lot of time in a freezer and , and learning how hotdogs and our meat was made , management was okay and the hardest part of the job being in the cold all the time and most enjoyable thing about the job was learning all the different kinds of meats and tasting some of them..."
good,In the four years I have been employed at Tyson Foods I have progressed as a person. Now able to supervisor and a team player at the same time. Gained the opportunity and learned alot about this industry.
good,Great benefits and salary.  Very long work weeks and tough to be promoted from  with in the company.  Good safety culture and quality is very important.
good,just a job I ahd to work in order to pay bills and this job was the worth of all I was able to work different areas but the smell and time of day I as working just didn't work for me.
good,"I worked there 6 weeks of 29 years,when I retired-they did nothing.I worked with nearly perfect attendance.Sure we worked 5-6 days a week(maybe 7) all reward was maybe a bag of pop-corn."
good,I think that it was ok to work here. The pay was good around the time i was working. They also had good benefits as well. I think that it would be a good job to work .at
good,Great place to work good money and benefits i learned everything i did wit in a couple of months .i ran a packing machine that wrap the product and we shipped the product out then i helped maintenance out with putting the film on the machines and help make adjustments
good,"I worked a lot of over time and the working conditions were very harsh. It was cold and lots  of dead animals, but it was part of the process, and I had to work"
good,Really nice place to work I would highly recommended plus the people are nice and if your struggling with any job that you require to do they are more than happy to show how is don't in a safe matter.
good,I was unfairly treated and the job is very stressful. Work environment is very cut throat and childlike as every one likes to spread rumors and talk about others behind their backs.
good,If you need a job and you have no experience this is a good place to start. Other then being over worked I don't think I could complain. I loved my immediate coworkers. Extremely sanitary!
good,"This job was dealing with poultry and smelling chickens wasn't really good in my opinion but the job was good the pay wasn't good at all but it provided things for myself and family. the  job wasn't too hard the supervisors was great, they work with you in the time of need, I enjoyed working with the company.."
good,I was a production supervisor with Tyson Foods and it was more about motivating your people so that they wanted to come to work.   We worked 7 days a week sometimes if we had product to get out to customers.  The hourly workers were hard workers.
good,There was numerous times where my line would get off super late. It was super cold in there. My coworkers was always eager to help! The supervisors were ok.
good,"Looking forward to a great experience!   I am unable to give a review at this time, our company was just acquired by Tyson.  Hoping for a positive experience."
good,"The upper management changes roughly every 2 or 3 years and with that comes change, it's hard to be stable in an environment that has no communication between staff and team members. I love my job, the team members make it for me."
good,"Loin came offline and I would inspect and send it to the shipping floor. We made the labels to put on boxes, it was in the part where we were always cold."
good,"Start early in the morning and you're done by 2:15. You learn many jobs,some supervisors are nice some are not. There is many people from different places."
good,"The position at Tyson was ok given the position I was at in my life at the time. They weren't very flexible at all. Now yes, I did move up pretty fast."
good,"Learned how to run multivac this time around. This required me too get film, stickers, and labels from the film room. Provided tubs and pallets, Kept up wit the orders so we wouldn't overrun ."
good,Sucks a lot I don't like it it does not care about anybody who works there the pay is not enough and the hours are never on time to get off or on breaks
good,"My first experience upon reaching America.  A period of adaptation. I learned coffee making and got the experience. Generally always busy, work , work. Working at 2:00am till 2:00pm especially when Katrina visited Lousiana, took for more than a month to produce the orders in Louisiana to be  completed  in California. The corporate management decided to close the plant in 2007."
good,"it has been a while since i worked there. Work was okay i just dint like much dirty water and blood so that why i looked for another job. I was also sick at that time so i ran out of points,"
good,Numerous amounts of hours and days put in year round. Very little downtime so this job felt as if it was consuming all of your life. Management is wonderful for the most part. Employees that stay (incredibly high turnover) work harder than should be required due to the shortage of team members.
good,The job was strenuous and was located far from my home. The company has great benefits and raises. Hanging live chicken is dirty and difficult.  Wouldn't recommend.
good,hard work but good money. Many different people work there to make money mostly uneducated people and older people and parents to help they family and their children.
good,My typical day consisted of Supervising of the Production Floor area. Sometimes the people seemed very unmotivated due to the plant continuing to breakdown and having to work harder knowing the plant was possible going to close. To many rumors about what was going on in Management. Hardest part of the job was keeping myself motivated in order to motivate my crew. The most enjoyable part was the different attitudes and my time off.
good,I really liked working there. But they just don't show us they care about how much we worked.  We was working 6 days a week with one day off and no lunch was provided for us by Tyson Foods
good,Workplace culture is okay. The people you work with are willing to teach you things if you asked. Laid back and friendly environment. The management could use a little more work and make the job more enjoyable with people willing to do teamwork. They should pay a little more also for all the work you do.
good,"It's fun, working as an team, to understand every procedure to which my assignment are place each day. To finished an assignment daily, to maintain my attendence."
good,Was not just electrical or HVAC worked as a maintenance.  Overall good work environment. Overall good crews. Overtime usually available weekly. Discounted prices for chicken is a plus.
good,"12 hour shift for four days Thursday thru Sunday, 6pm-6am. Supervisors are awfully means and not understanding when it came to school. Loved the job the management was just a bit to much finished the summer before school started then found another job. Would have loved to stay if the management was different."
good,"Stressful work environment, management never seems to agree on company priorities, and constant restructuring. Training is not sufficient for the demand of the work."
good,Fast paced working environment only real issues is it is union ran and most everyone working there are related so you might have 3 families working on one line.
good,I started in June of least year & I've learned so much with in that time. They have really nice people that work there. And we always work as a team. Nice workplace to work
good,"large company. advancement opportunities always busy, and a good idea to bring a jacket to work because of the cold. puts safety as a big priority and good benefits"
good,Tyson is a productive  place to work. Just the work is very repetitive. Your either in a wet environment or cold. Sometimes you have to work over or on the weekends.
good,At Tyson Foods the bottom tier of the of the workforce are over worked and exhausted. And if you could not keep up they terminated you with a reason that did not line up with the situation.
good,The work is not hard just a lack of communication between management and their team members. The right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing!!
good,it was ok it was cold my supervisor was evil and I left because I didn't wanna keep going through that situation it was cool
good,The job is what u make it its not hard at all and not eazy at all. But i like my job just looking for something different. But over all i have some good long days at tyson
good,"Can Be Overwhelming With Getting Jobs Done In Time , Sometimes Worked 24 hrs To Finnish In Time For Production To Begin On Monday."
good,I enjoyed my time at Tyson Foods. They worked with my schedule and were there to help when I needed it. I liked the different job opportunities they offered.
good,"I was just starting to work in a production setting, so I took a 3rd shift position.  I had to adjust to the time, but also working the cold condition.  This job was good that it got be started in a full-time work experience."
good,"to use hand and power tools to do repair work on machines."
good,"Management does not care how hard you work as long as they meet their quotas, job is ridiculous and you have to work there for years before you can move up to another mediocre position"
good,Only if you need a job desperately . Just really wasn't all that it was cracked up to be. I didn't like it at all. Maybe you can find more for your abilities but I feel I was over qualified
good,"The company was not Hillshire when i was there.It sold to a Mexican company while I was there, then closed down. But while it was open, they did not give me enough hours to survive on."
good,"Tyson was a fun workplace, and the hours worked for my family. They had holiday meals which were nice for the employees and the work was not very difficult.  The people were fun to work with."
good,The pay rate is amazing here and seeing that they have their own store for fresh meat to buy is a plus. The people are helpful and don't make you feel stupid when you do something wrong.
good,work with cleaning chickens and lacing belts adjusting load scales some knowledge of hydraulics and pneumatics and working with relays.
good,work on production line packing and grading poulrty according to procedures.continuous work .fast paced enviorment.cold and wet enviorment
good,"my typical day of work was very long but yet so pleasant, working at a fast speed makes your shift go by very fast. you learn how to work work around a lot of different people, management is good."
good,"Its physically tiring to work at a place like this, you can get physically hurt, also cold conditions to work in, but like they say its a tough job but someone has to do it."
good,"Overall good experience but need to relocate. Lunch timing could be better, and 15 minute breaks are not paid which is a bit of a disappointment. Weekend off was good."
good,"It's a very fun and cool job. Typical work day include;standing around  until the convertor starts, picked bad parts of chicken off the line as it came to my area."
good,"so started in the kill floor,it was a great changes to learn all the step it take to butcher a cow,all the different job titles,the hours where great,learning a different langues was hard but cool"
good,"while I didn't work every job in the facility I did work there for a while and the general consensus was that the job sucked. we were paid well of course but the hours, work required, and general lack of efficiency at the job made a single day feel like 2. maybe because it was night shift so it technically was 2 days"
good,regular manufacturing job. typical day at work involves cleaning machines so production to start.  hardest part is the lack of equipment they seem to have
good,It is a place that is easy to get on considering they have taken people without high school diplomas or GEDs. They also taken many with criminal backgrounds. It just isn't the type of place to move up unless you want to be a maintenance or a supervisor. Every year raise is given to the yearly raise the new hires will get after one year. So working there just a year you be making the same as someone working like six years.
good,Didnt like tyson for nothing in the world horrible/dangerous work areas.  They don't give you 40 hrs. of work every week.
good,"A typical day at work went as follows: I would get my schedule, go to my line, and give direction.  Then, walk the line to make sure everything was being done safely and correctly while the favorites sat in the office and talked about sports with the boss."
good,I enjoyed working here. It was a great place to build my experience in a warehouse enviroment and I learned new things regarding the preparatory process with the product produced.
good,im looking to find full time job and find in Nebraska.. cant find rent there and i have to quit and move back to flroida
good,It was good place to work I have enjoyed working there. I had so much fun doing staff  and working so many different people.
good,"I enjoyed becoming part of the safety team and leading co-workers in this area.  At times it was frustrating when maintenance would shut down a line to attempt to repair a machine and staff would just have to stand and wait, even if it was for multiple hours."
good,I worked my way up at the facility over 5 years while attending school. They provided a scholarship opportunity which was great. I started as a Supervisor Trainee right after finishing school. I learned a great deal about cattle processing. After working on the production floor I worked as a trainer. The management team was ok. I had some great co-workers along the way. The hardest part of the job was the physical labor. The most enjoyable part was the training position I had for about three years. In the end they layed off a great deal of the employees and shut down part of the plant.
good,with hardest part of the job was driving an hour a day to and hour a day from work. management was ok on first shift at times. I moved up to supervisor only after working in this position for two months.
good,"My experience in this company was really bad since i had extremly over hours i bearly had days off, i worked pass midnight and i worked on freezing cold refrigerators."
good,"hard work, but pays well. you work with a very diverse bunch of co workers.There are sometimes communication problems. I think a lot of injuries could be avoided if production was slowed down to a more comfortable pace."
good,"I worked at Tyson for many years. My typical day was going in and assisting the supervisors and GPM's with whatever they needed. being a jack of all trades, learning everything i could at the facility. Management ranged from great to sad, depending on you worked for. I't didn't matter to me, i did my job to the best of my ability and assisted anyone who needed it. Again co-workers range in at great to  sad, pending on where you were. Hardest part of the job was nothing. I honestly didn't find anything at Tyson to be difficult or hard in any way. My most enjoyable would be coming in and knowing i made sure product came in and left in good condition and in a timely manner."
good,It was good pay for the job that I was doing. I had a really good team of people to work with and I made really great friends. The supervisors in my area would work with you if you needed them too. They had no problem with jumping in and helping out.
good,"The culture at Tyson is highly stressful for all team members, The production team is not fully held accountable for the daily operation of the production floor,  For the most part the upper management is a good team,  The culture is to criticize quickly and praise rarely."
good,We worked extremely hard for our money. People were over worked and under paid. They would give us yearly bonuses instead of raises.
good,Sliced and cleaned chickens in production line. Handled food products and worked in production line. Co-workers were friendly. Nice environment.
good,Has lots of hours and descent pay for the area.  Does have some disadvantages as it is a cold area to work in and other parts of plant are too warm.  Over all it does have lot of nice people and the work is not that hard to do.
good,Management does nothing to solve problems or assist employees for advancement. Benefits are very good pay could be better
good,a tyical day was in at 4pm untell finish at 2am.i learned how to be patient and work hard and fast.the management was fair and good.my co-worker was hard to work with.they was young and had a lot of playing in them.the hardest part was keeping warm it was cold in the plant.the most enjoyable part was the end of the night.
good,"A typical work day requires me to be apart of a teamwork atmosphere. The management seems to be disorganized and stuck in their old ways. For the most part management seems to be willing and open to hearing new ideas and input, and also understand that life happens."
good,"I worked on assembly line of package meats bagging meat, sorting different size packages to the racks and cleaning area for the next shift."
good,"I worked nights at this job and the food we were offered came from expensive vending machines. Not only that, but we were not allowed to leave during our lunch break to buy food from local stores."
good,They insured the training period was adhered to  insure world class service. They encouraged daily growth in assigned area through acquiring new profitable customers
good,"You work long hours and get an okay pay for it, but the people are interviewed enough to try to work out all the bugs so there are a lot of arguments and people come and go fast. Not very many people stay for long periods of time. It is hard work depending where you work and can sometimes be degrading."
good,The job was okay. You were guaranteed hours. Management seemed to bump heads a lot. Never knew what time you were getting off work when you worked second shift.
good,"Things were good at Tyson just one bad apple will spoil the whole basket of fruit, but it was an ok job for the most part I did learn a lot and I had a lot of support ."
good,"I enjoyed the pay that came with working for Tyson and the medical benefits, but it is not a good company if you have a family that you would like to spend time with."
good,Typical Day was almost like catching up on work that first didnt do because 2nd shift couldnt complete all of their work because first shift couldnt not complete their work from the following day. almost like an on going cycle. Neither shift was at fault it was the machines and lack of training they gave us. Its a cold environment and the people are ok...1st shift was more politics and 2nd shift was more of the ones who got the short end of the stick. working 2nd shift u will never know what time you were getting off and dont even think about making plans for the weekends they may just take that from you as well.
good,Gulf state is a place that has lots of choices and mostly labor that cause lots of binding at the time you had supervisor that would stay on you bout breaks
good,"it was ok , it was a job not a career, co-workers was good, working in the cold wasn't that great, best part of the day was clocking out."
good,"I have found that the process in any plant has many hurdles on a daily basis, Staying educated on the latest software and equipment will consume a lot of your time. Never a dull moment!"
good,"Your day consisted of cutting an X cut in chicken tenders. You would sometimes move to other parts of the line, but not always. My supervisor was a really good guy."
good,"Monday always a lot of work learning somthing new every day , taking care of every thing in my work área, enjoying every moment"
good,I love working at Tyson foods. Because I love working on stuff. It was just the people over you was the problem there. But I did my job and love doing it.
good,I am provided with all materials needed. I am never not working on something. I am given opportunities to learn new things and exercise the things I already know.
good,"Typical day at work preparing machines, cutting, packing, bagging, weighing, and stapling bags. Staff was very impolite, unprofessional,and didn't care rather the product was good or bad."
good,"Sell, sell, sell, sell, sell, sell. This job started me in the cell business.  I liked it, managed the store in the small town of Huntsville and decided to move to the bigger and better side of things and go to AT&T."
good,Working in a chicken prossessing plant isn't all that fun. You are always wet and cold. but I did like a lot of the people I worked with. I also liked several of the supervisers.
good,"If your looking for just a job with a steady pay its a good place , not much room for improvement, company has great benefits"
good,I had no problems with my co-workers but I prefer not to give my detailed opinion on this particular employer. They worked me a lot of hours even through Christmas and Thanksgiving.

good,"•	Fork Lift Driver"
good,"A typical day would b working hard until my shift was over. I learned how to d bone chickens. the co workers were fun to be around, I think that how I got through most of my nights. the hardest part about it was staying awoke on the line. I enjoyed the people there."
good,come in unload trucks part of the day and keep the lines running with the proper supplies.  Hardest part of the job was not having enough time some days and the forklifts were always breaking down.  Most enjoyable part of the job was my coworkers.  Management let employees get away with to much and the ones that worked hard got all bad news.
good,Good Stable work Environment poor hours. Good benefits and health insurance. Has been a great career opportunity with extensive growth potential.

good,"A typical day at Tyson's Food is working at a quick pace, helping other workers and having all type of conversations on the job. I learned how to perform other positions on the job and I learned  from co-workers and they performed their jobs. It was a great experience getting to know new and experienced people on the job. The hardest part of the job was that sometimes people did not seem to have the energy on some work days but we got the job done. The most enjoyable part of the job was when the boss would be in a good mood. The day would go bye a little bit smoother!"
good,"I learned how to be a line utility worker which allowed me to learn supervisory skills."
good,"I deeply enjoy the work and it is rewarding as well as a positive environment in which to work. the work involves but is not limited to collection rounds, pm's. and troubleshooting."
good,Never had any complaints about co-workers. Typical large corporation feeling. Management handles issues as expected in large corporate setting. Solid compensation and benefits for what is asked. I had no complaints.
good,"It's a job with good benefits, but its a severe strenuous job on your whole body, with low pay."
good,"A typical day was come into work and get dressed out and go out on the floor, I learned how to cut and clean chicken, management was okay always could go to them and talk to them if you had to, Co-workers where nice to be around, Hardest part of the job was learning how to keep up at first. Most enjoyable part would be getting off at the same time every night."
good,The company as a whole has a great system but plenty of flaws and unwilling workers to settle problems and reach standardized goals.
good,took opportunity to learn continuous improvement.  Was able to move up from a line worker to a interim plant superintendent.
good,"Some of the workers weren't very cooperative, the Supervisors were very respectable but it was a trying job at times, overall I enjoyed the experience but I could not see myself making a career out of the job."
good,"This place was just a job. The favorites game was played too much with management. If you weren't considered one of their ""pets"" you couldn't advance."

Put on work jacket { white for productjon } { red for floor person} then puttingon plastic apron. sleeves, and gloves sanitize these articles and go into room to assigned job position. Most of the supervisors were really good to work for, and would help in a pinch. The co-workers were different nationalities, enjoyable to work with and get to know.  The hardest part was standing at your job station when a machine broke down , and it was ar32-40 degees in there. Most enjoyable was getting the products done during your shift in a timely period."

good,"While working at Tyson's I had many responsibilities. We produced approximately 175,000 lbs of meat per shift and I was responsible to make sure the room ran smoothly. I worked every position in the room and picked up the slack from any spot that wasn't keeping up with the pace. My main job required me to be on the computer to formulate fat percent to meet the requirement that my supervisor needed to fill process orders. I learned how to drive a fork lift efficiently as well as operating multiple machines. I enjoyed working with my co-workers, although, the hardest part of the job was never knowing when we would be off. Working as late as 2:45 AM then coming back in at 2:00 PM the next day for several days in a row. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was the experience and responsible I was given. The room expected me to perform everyday and I gave 110%."
good,Working for Journey's allowed me to be an individual and gave me the chance to find out what it meant to be in charge.  Running a store was a great challenge and prepared me for my next step in life.

good,"checked in at guard shack"
good,Was my first job. Didn't not plan on making a career out of poultry so I left and went back to school some
good,Work production is fast.  Environment is extremely cold.  Supervisors are strict.  Management is awful.  Employees do not cooperate together to get work done effectively.
good,The quality of the job mostly depends on the quality of your lead. It is an extremely faced paced environment where you will learn a lot but working at the plant is very demanding and you have to pay attention to small details and maintain control of them while still maintaining control of your overall process.

good,"Fun place to work, contract work that was difficult to find permanent placement."
good,Started off on the assembly line and worked my way up to a management position. I have learned that management is not an easy job. What I enjoy most about my job is that I have a part in making sure that this company produces safe and quality foods.
good,Lacks in supervision during work day. Not much more to say. A lot of good people work there then there are the ones who just show up with no intentions on working.
good,I have learned to be on time and its my job to come in and make sure the area is clean. the batteries charged and make sure we have enough wrap to wrap the pallets. My lead man was doing his making everything was right. The hardest part about the when people didn't show up to work and wen they horse play. The fun part about the job wen everybody getting alone and working as a team.
good,I had to be on time and made sure my aera was clean and unload trucks and load back up trucks
good,really enjoyed the job and co workers. also enjoyed the end results .
good,"Tyson is a chicken plant it process birds were they take different parts of the chicken and debone it and than they pack it and ship it out to different factors to sell,its a cold place to work in when you debone chicken,over night you clean the entire building for the next shift to come on and have a fresh start."
good,"poor ethics on medical staff, worked evenings for duration, tried several times to transfer to days to be with my family more, endured remarks from co-worker, one supervisor always making rude remarks, this was the hardest part because i needed to work."
good,I loved working with the fork lift. I had no problems with being able to pull orders to load trucks
good,"A typical day at work i would arrive 20 minutes early to get all the instruments counted and checked in. Every co worker reported to the line for work, I would hand them their numbered work instrument for that half at work. This job taught me how to be a team leader working under management. Even though my work environment was very busy and fast paced I loved the work environment"
good,i worked on an assembly line we produced petri dishes for different companies includeing hospitals.i had a great experience in knowing what the petri dishes were used for and the formations and colors had a purpose as well. our team had a very productive supervisor she well lead my team of co-workers who were very determained. my team was very specila we worked in a room called a clean room had to stay very sterile for the petri dishes that we were working with i enjoyed every part of my job i was very very thankful for the oppertunity and experience.
good,average day is working very long hours and freezing. the people were fairly nice but it is not a family oriented place. the worst part is not have employer who cares about you.
good,"Tyson Foods was a good employer for many years."
good,Hardest part working here is management. Co-workers are okay but good to keep distance.
good,"Good days at work."
good,"Great food service business. Good benefits,decent pay, little room for advancement."
good,"I have learned a lot from Tyson about the food industry. I would recommend working with Tyson for people that are looking to learn more about the food industry, and be well organized and able to work in a fast pace environment. I enjoy working with Tyson, however I am wanting to get out of the food industry."
good,"gets you motivated to do more, learn  more from just a position."
good,"This company have been changing for the past few years. I'm happy to see that Sara Lee/Hillshire Brands has settled on it's brands, and are focusing on the meat products as their premier product."
good,"Plenty of pay"
good,"Working at Tyson, you don't really need a college education, thus it is a good starting point in the labor market."
good,Repetitive and dont pay that well. No room to advance.nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnlknlknnlnlmlk
good,"great place to work, decent pay, constantly changing enviroment"
good,This job was hard and none stop. You had to get your assigned area done with in a time limit or the next shift would not be able to start on time. The good thing was the people I worked with where great.
good,"Good place to work, learn how to operate several differnt machines"
good,Tyson is a good place to work has alot of good benefits that come with the job
good,"very busy."
good,I trained all mangement in warehouse. I created new procedures ininventory and increased productivity.
good,"Tyson is an ok company overall, however, they want Tyson to be your entire life,we work six days a week half the time,with only sunday off,most of management is Spanish as are most of the workers, and you never know what they are saying to each other because they speak Spanish,i can continue to work there if need be but I would like to find a forty hr a week job,not a fifty hrs a week"
good,"During my employment at Sara Lee, I learned more about what team work was all about as you worked on teams and you were only as strong as the weakest team member."
good,"The work is not difficult, just repetitive.  Some of the co-workers have a lot of growing up to do.  It would be great to go to work for one day and everyone not be worried about what the next person is doing.  I think this type of work is better for individuals who don’t have small children at home."
good,great plce to work if you like people and the cold. i learned how to run a packing machine and food safety and quality assurance
good,like working here. nice to have a set schedule. liked the people i work with
good,Not enough communication between employer and employees.
good,You work in a plant and process and prepare chicken for various comapnies. The most enjoyable part of my job was learning the process of where my chicken comes from.
good,I agree it's a fun place to work and the other people that work there are great.
good,A lot of drama but overall it was a place to work. I learned how to stay to myself.
good,"I have learned to be more patient with my team members."
good,This job is not for everyone. If you like to be working with chicken this is the job for you. In this job you get to see the back side of how the chicken is prepared to be sent out to the grocery stores for the customers to buy
good,I had to pack 40 breast in a minute. It taught me how to work as a team
good,Tyson Foods is a place where good quality meat and the overall satisfaction of the company is top priority.
good,Its very hard steady work..very cold but friendly place to work..But they cut hours..need more hours..NO RAISE IN 4 YEARS ALSO
good,Catching chickens and putting them into cages for shipment. I learned the proper way to catch chickens. The management was okay and the co-workers as well. The hardest part of the job was lifting 10 chickens at one time and having to put them in the cage. No enjoyments.
good,"i worked on 3rd shift which was terminated. after 3rd shift ended, i was placed on2nd shift which i ended up with no particular job. 20 minutes after clock in i was told to go home due to no where to be put. after several weeks of being sent back home everyday; no paycheck at end of work week to pay my bills, i left. no unemployment benefits were paid to me thru this company."
good,My typical day work whould start as me coming in checking the scales mking sure they worked properly and stocked up on trays. After that I would prepare to get onthe line to pack tenders with my co-workers to make production for the day. The hardest part of the jobs was when the machinces would mess up and we would get behind and the most enjoyable part of the job was that I always was busy throughout the day.
good,It was very neat working at the antique shop. I had fun seeing some of the things that came in the store to be priced. My bosses were really neat. They let me work when I wanted..but it didnt pay well. It was just a secondary job anyways
good,Set up daily schedule for plant production.
good,Mainframe software programmer
good,"I learned more about fast work tasking. I learned about inventory and how it works from beginning to end, costing what costing affected in our life. Payroll I really enjoyed most of all. The hardest part of my job was how Tyson expected me to learn all jobs within 2 months. I did, but it was a hard task to make. Only thing was trying to keep costng and inventory separate in my mind on how to enter in the reports and spreadsheets. I only worked them jobs when the team members was off for being sick or vacation. That was the hard part because trying to remember everything and keep all separate. The management was not the best. They were very hard to deal with especially one of my bosses. She would tell you how to do it, then say do the job that makes you comfortable then change her mind. That was the job kicker. It is hard to work under circumstances like that. She would make differences between all team members in the department. The co-workers were a little hard to get to know. There was atleast one co-worker that keep everyone in a terminal."
good,"This place hires anyone including illegals even though they post that they will not. It has great benefits and great pay but they will not give raises anymore.Many of the leads and supervisors do not know what they are doing. Many of them just like to hold up the walls and do things that regular workers get yelled at for doing. There is a lot of favoritism at these plants. When you get hired with this company they treat you really nice and tell you that it's quality over quanitity but after starting to actually work, you will realize it's the opposite. Overall you get paid really good but treated really horribly."
good,I learned how to work on a line and as a team. I would like to go back to this company.
good,"Hardest part of the job would be the area and lack of management at this particular location. It has great benefits and advancement opportunities. It is nice to see the progress you have made when you look back to where you started, but the hours and time put into this job with the lack of drive from almost all other management makes the work conditions not worth the money."
good,fast pace work enviroment the hardest part of the job was that we had to find the bone which was a small bone in the chicken breast and cut it out an put it back on the line an we had to do 16 a minute and it was really cold there.
good,I would go to my department and find my station. Read the board and enter the information into my scale. Make sure it has the right labels and start labeling and packing the product. I learned how to self motivate in this job and how to communicate with people of different nationalities. With this job it felt like i was working in a big freezer. I most enjoyed the fast pace and self reliability this job helped me to form and cultivate.
good,"i worked there for over a year and i was able to pay the bills, long hours, 30 minute lunch breaks, very fast pace work enviroment, i like working at tysons"
good,"·Clock in on time, Put all safety equipment on, ready to work and work hard."
good,"I come to work, put on my work gear, head to the department and line up accordingly with the conveyor belt, and being making the plates for the airlnes"
good,"I was lead in my room which I was in charge of three people in the room we called ""Case Off"". We boxed the frozen product, palletized the boxes and then stored in shipment freezer. I learned the responsibilities of being in charge and making things run smoothly. Management was ok and most of the co-workers were friendly. The hardest part of the job was that sometimes we would have to clean out the spiral freezer when tacos got jammed up on the conveyor. The best part of the job was that we got free tacos and bacon and the money was not that bad."
good,i hung the chickens up by there feet for ten hours they make make up out of ckicken blood
good,--on a typical day they will give us good support
good,it was very demanding and fast paced and very independantly working.
good,I enjoyed working for this company. The work was hard labor but i enjoy a challenge and having to use inner strength. The hours were flexible with room for overtime.
good,wet and dirty job had to be able to withstand the heat wich was the hardest part of the job tht and the heavy lifting. the most enjoyable part of the job was not having to sit or stand in the same spot
good,Tyson is a large company.
good,it a good job to work at if u can get on there. they will not hire u if u have worked for tyson in the past.
good,"Has been a good place to work, but as of late I have had trouble moving onward or upward. I would like to expand my work knowledge,but have run into road blocks with this company. It seems like I am stuck in this area of live production and would like to move on."
good,"Working with this company while in its start up process, I've became more indepth in Robots."
good,"Tysons was an very diffrent experience for me having to deal with raw meat,but i can say the pay was great and they use team work alot without a team it would not run right thats for sure."
good,"They are not for the employees, stay on your feet all of the shift poor management and lack of communication. I will not recommend no one to work there."
good,"I pack and I have to do paper work such as weights on the packages that come down the line and I have to write dow the code dates, we work together as a team to get stuff done, Human Resources was horrible they didn’t take my taxes out for a whole year, they were so unorganized didn’t update points at all the clock in system was messed up"
good,Here at Tyson they pay well for what you do but after being here for over a year I feel as if I don’t belong mostly because of the management treating you like your just like the beef they slaughter.
good,"Safety and Universal Precautions. They always practice safe everyday. And hand washing too. Clean room to put Aprin, head cover, gloves, foot covers . Nurse on duty."
good,"This is a job is not for the weak of heart, there is many factors were you will need to be able to move around a lot. This job is very physically demanding , this is not a good place to work if you can not be around raw meat as well as certain people.  The work is sometimes worth the pay you get paid weekly $400 plus you get benefits after 3 months of working."
good,Hourly is the best. Management has lack of training. There is a lack of communication in management areas. They pay good and have good benefits. And 401k
good,"Everything is ok until you have a accident then all things change after that nobody is your friend. dispatch are workers like drivers the company is good, good equipment. while you are clean on all records."
good,Grande empresa Americana com dificuldade de adaptação ao mercado local.
good,The manager and office staff are rude after ur hired on and not helpful at all. Other then that it was ok. If you make the supervisor mad where I worked she wold make it hard for you and work your line the hardest if she couldn’t she would move u to somewhere that was hard.
good,Descent Place I liked it when I first started but it got to be where management didnt care about you they cared about getting product out which is fine and happens in every factory if theyd quit hiring idiots in managemtn be a good job
good,"My typical day at work is really non stop. I learn new stuff everyday really. I can run and operate the machines and mixers on a daily basis. The management is okay overall. They try to work with you the best they can and any way they can. Overall the workplace culture is pretty good. Don't get me wrong the workplace environment has its ups and downs but what workplace doesn't. I believe that the hardest part of my job is the hours that I work and how we work. I work the night shift (3rd shift). This being said, I'm at work from 11 pm that night until 7 am the next morning. Its not ideal but its my job. Id say the most enjoyable part of my job is knowing im working able to pay my bills."
good,"Tyson will train you to do the job you are hired for. There is opportunities for advancement through bidding jobs. A lot of management started on the floor as a regular worker. The downside is that the work is hard, hours often long, and often mandatory over-time."
good,"Not a bad place to work in my town. But the work is tedious and mostly the same old stuff. Pay isn't great, after 2 years you are maxed out on pay. There are people that have been here since 2001 and you will make just as much as them in 2 years. Tyson is a huge company that could afford to pay their employees a couple more bucks an hour for all the bs they have to deal with."
good,"Ok to work for, but company only sees an employee ID, not a person. This sentence is to just make sure the review meets the minimum number of characters."
good,"On a typical day I reviewed production schedules, discussed and implemented any needed changes, reviewed environmental and safety reports and conducted walk-arounds to review progress or find issues, Conducted staff meetings, reviewed cost cutting goals and helped develop new measures, reviewed FSQA and USDA findings and followed up with any corrective measures, reviewed maintenance, inventory, and purchasing activities and helped with any necessary changes or additions to work or orders."
good,Not a terrible company to work for but not very recomended. They say there is opportunity to grow but ive been declined for all my attempts at bettering myself here. HR has been a joke from the start.
good,Work most weekends so you barely havr a social life if any. If you have small children I wouldnt recommend applying at Tysons because you would never get to see them.
good,Tyson Foods is a ruthless company. Every 2-3 years you will have a Black Friday. Every 2-4 years you will have to “reapply” for your own job while execs make 5-10 million bonuses. It is a survival based company.
good,This is a good starter job but wages are to low to make a career out of it.  Some of your Co workers a hard to get along with but overall ok job just not for me.
good,Authority abused their positions. The general workers very nice and hard workers.The work is demanding but the money was worth it. I do not wish to return due to administraton.
good,it was a good job mangement was gook it was just to cold thethe job is very fair just dress warmre if you can stand the cold that would be  a goood job
good,My review of Tyson is good just a lot of hours working good people work there they help you with anything you need Tyson is just one big family they take of you if you take care of them
good,Hard work. Alot of jobs aren't classified right. Theres no communication. Its stressful. Theres alot of overtime for the people that want it. No sick pay. Coworkers are always arguing over team work. If you're not a favorite u have too work hard
good,Union is the thing i disliked the most the moment you start working there you pay for them to back u... Then i found out the Union don't fight for you and you wasted all the money..
good,"Working at Tyson Foods is I must say stressful and without a doubt you will have no life. The pay is great, but the hours can sometimes get out of hand. I can't say its not a good job that it is it can just use a few changes. As for management they're great no one person is the same and everyone has a job to do, and with that being said if you do your job and follow Tyson number one rule which is safety you will not have a problem with management."
good,Work varies on department u hv no life if u work second shift lots of many different people and cultured some good dome bad management is ok depending on department
good,"I did many jobs in the plant over the years I was employed there. After several years, I began to have heath problems due to the repetitious movements required at this job. (These health problems are permanent and have not gotten better even after changing careers.) Benefits aren’t bad, and there’s paid vacations with options for stock purchase plan."
good,most of the management looked out for the other management more than the actual under employees    in other words if It was going to get them (the upper management) in trouble they would find a way to get around it or throw someone else under the bus for the lower employees
good,"good place to work! good team membership!"
good,i have been in Tyson fresh meat for 12 year. I learn many things from my team members who come from many countries. I learn how to deal with new issues come up on my jobs.
good,Productive place to work.But HR treats some employees unfairly by accepting untrue statements and not thoroughly investigating the situation.Advanced quickly in company.Room for advancement.Lots of supervisors for each department.
good,"It was an alright job when I was younger, as I grew older my medical limitations prove too difficult to continue working there. Salary was nice and health benefits were satisfactory."
good,It’s a good work place I just Believe they pay should be more... it’s a very cold environment to work in..In so area you will have to be prepared to use a knife
good,"I was let go due to organizational changes.  I enjoyed my time at Tyson, I feel that they helped me with my career goals.  I wish I could have stayed on due to the amazing retirement here."
good,Great job just a hostile umwelcome environment. A whole bunch of favoritism in the workplace a few harassing employees dishonest supervisors just a poor experience
good,this is a fast-paced somewhat interesting job with a high employee turnover rate. You'll learn all you want to know about poultry production. There are a lot of good people there but there are also some not so good. Your co-workers and supervisors are constantly changing so it's hard to establish a routine  or norm.
good,"Very structured, but stressed in the aspect getting orders out of the door. I would recommend this company to anyone who is an experienced manager and that can figure out there area of responsibility with out guidance."
good,Great management  lots of overtime. Pay could be better.  Good work place overall good Co workers.  Two breaks and one lunch.  Discount store for employees.
good,"I would not recommend this job to anyone with physical pain. I honestly, wouldn't recommend this job to anyone because if you don't have pain now, you will after working here. The pay is amazing and you could live off of it."
good,I really didnt like this job for one u standing in one spot all day for 8hrs .an the water can get into your boots.I liked the job a little it wasnt a hard job if you could keep up. My job was too tie off birds.
good,My job was very tough and difficult sometimes because my fellow employees never cut the chicken properly which made my job harder than what it already was. I’ve watched too many people get into fights and the environment was filled with negativity.
good,Can't really understand many ppl working at Tyson  .   Easy work. Sometimes stressful. Has short breaks and  long standing in one spot for up to 4 hours at a time with was kinda too much .    I enjoyed working for Tyson and glad to meet ppl from there but I am looking for something better for myself and for my family
good,The people you work with are the best of all am some of the supervisor are fun to work with an they are down to earth but away times it can get very hard on you but it don't last that long so if you can hey threw that you still have a good day
good,It was a good job to work at I made good money and i also came across a bunch of great opportunities. If they gave me more hours I would still be there
good,Able to provide the best Production order that was need to be completed by the end of each shift and entering the data for the day and counting inventory
good,My typical day at Tyson started with me changing into my workday. I would go pick up my assignment and go to warehouse. Through my career at Tyson I learned how to log and deliver accurately and in a time manner as well logistics. The best part of my job was learning new skill sets to better my role within the company.
good,"hard labor, don't go in expecting anything easy. the environment is good, a lot of good people work there. everyone is friendly and work hard, it's a great place to work, but it's hard work"
good,Fast paced work long time standing on your feet. Always have work to do. Will never have to worry bout being laid off. Production area is tight spaced
good,I would recommend this place- as long as you are a young person without a family. this place does not offer stability for single parents or those who have outside lives.
good,I have no tips for Tyson foods at all it is a nice place to work I would work there again just need to hire more workers and it would be a great business
good,"Tyson Distribution Center is a very good paying job,I learned so much in these last two years from working there,I received my forklift certificate from Tyson,and I met great people there"
good,"I worked at this place over ten years ago, and have been required to provide this review to be able post my profile on Indeed. I do not have an opinion on the current state of affairs."
good,"Work with you on family and things that come up. It's cold and wet i went through alot of different boots."
good,This is a great company to learn about chicken production and how these things work and how chicken is cut up and cooked and also great company to learn about cleaning  the machines that the chicken is cut up and cooked  on
good,A great company too learn about chicken production and how those things work and also a great job to learn about machine shops and how to work on the machines in the maintenance  program
good,"Called on accounts.  Responsible for sales and service  to stores in the area.  Had salesman and supervisors to supervise and train."
good,they teach  you how to drive a standup  ( landoll ) forklift my day would be from unloading 1 cooler and taking it to production area and doing that for 6 to 8 hours
good,"I worked at the Hatchery not the plant but it is just as bad. In my position which was low level production tray wash. Was exposed to heat and steam of over 100 degrees with no breaks until production was complete which usually took 6-8 hours 4 days a week and recently they changed their policy to where no drinks were allowed on production floor so that just made it worse. Constantly felt if though I was gonna pass out from dehydration and heat exhaustion from moving so fast in the heat. Not to mention the chemical exposure even with proper ppe that they played off as heat rash, when people who didn't even work in the heat were getting it. I did this job to pay the bills but was fired due to catching the flu and then having to call out again to care for my son who also caught it. Even though I had doctors notes they still fired me. No biggie though as I was about to take another job anyways. I honestly wouldn't recommended anyone to work for them unless in desperate need of money, just based on the health concern."
good,A good place to get your career started but has a revolving door for hourly associates they loose their job or quite then 3 months later they re-apply and are rehired.
good,a typical day at work is from 530 till 230about everyday we work over i want overtime on my days off i wanna get off work when my shift is over not later then my shift everynight
good,"New management is making big efforts towards shifting Tyson Foods into a Technology/Consumer centric mindset. A typical day of work revolves around working to improve the end-user experience for Tyson Foods supply chain operations personnel (process improvement, system enhancement, break/fix, etc.)"
good,"It was a really fun place to work, even  though it was not the kind of job I would like to do for too long. Management was pleasant to work with. If you don't mind working in production, it can work out for anyone."
good,"The atmosphere for the work place is great, the idea's and drive for how everything comes together is logical and ingenius... However management does seem to be a little weak for the amount of people we have at the plant, not to mention the drive to hire outside of the plant is stronger than promoting those within. This opens doors to weak links between the connection to team members and their bosses. "
good,Working at Tyson was very challenging because the Departments are either really hot or really cold there is no in between. Tyson offers health benefits paid time off and vacation.
good,"Company culture promotes career development, giving back to the community, and upholding a strong culture of professionalism.  They are dedicated to raising the world's awareness of what good food can do."
good,"Both branches where I work have since been bought out by a competitor. I have kept in touch with my former co-workers, and only one is still with the company."
good,"Tyson was a very fast moving place to work I like the people and like the fact that it was fast , in some positions it was really hard but not imposible"
good,"A typical day consists of lining boxes with bags and sending them down the line for product to be placed before shipping.Once tables were filled with boxes, we cleaned up our area."
good,"Good experience to interact with lower middle class members of society. The social experience is invaluable,however it's all department sensitive temperature range from extreme heat to extreme cold so proper preparation is a must. Management is contengient upon age,race,& experience as to how departments are managed."
good,I loved the job it was real nice it has great benefits an their able to send you to school if you want to. The only bad thing is that the pay rate could have been better.
good,Keep a smile and speak... The Elderly Will Make Anyone Day Better... The Have Great Employees And Elderly Resident Are Like Our Babies... We Love Them.
good,The job was alright but I was let go for being gone a few times due to my daughter being sick which I believe was  bit wrong. But that was just my leads decision not the companies.
good,"Excellent Money. Work always comes before family, I understand this is important sometimes but not always. Promises for raises are often made but not carried through. Good medical benefits"
good,Took the time out to be trained and was a very hard worker. It was a challenge that I chose to take. It was not the job for me..  left the job.. found one with better pay.
good,"This is a great place to work with great benefits. I was in Maintenance working 7 days a week. I would work 13 hours Monday threw Saturday and then 4 hours on Sunday. I was going in at 5:30 PM and getting off at 6:00 AM, never having time for my child and wife."
good,"Secured job with stable income and the work was pretty laid back but I hated the people I worked with. I like that the work was not too strenuous and it was very laid back, however I was getting arthritis due to working with my hands too often. They put you in a different department everyday and you will work with different people everyday so everyday will not be the same. Supervisors are not fair. They don't let you talk while working."
good,Great place if your a man. If your wife or girlfriend works there bosses will try to sleep with her. Then if she says no. She's fired. Very big on hooking up around there. All employees do all day is flirt and hookup in the box room. Like I said. Not bad place if your single or your woman works right next to you.
good,I supported a very talented manager that made things easy for everyone on her staff. She supported career growth and helped to develop all of her people.
good,"Everyone is assigned a task from the beginning to the end of the shift. I have learned to throw, sift, seal and pack pet product. Since we come from different culture, I learned to be more patient and support others. It is a physical job with consequences, but t is a best place to practice English."
good,"Working here can get hectic, lots of people and different personalities. They do have good pay and lots of benefits.A lot of the jobs require standing for long periods, with only one break a day.They do however have lots of room for advancement to higher paying jobs and job security."
good,Honestly my time at Tyson foods was wonderful yes it is indeed a hard general labor job. But at the end of the day it is one good and extremely legit way to bring home an honest income.
good,"Day/Night Shifts Available. Nights Start Work On A Sunday.Its Very Cold & Has An Undescrible Smell From The Chicken. Paid Weekly , Line Incentives."
good,I would like to still be working there if they just brighten up half the peoples attitudes. It got so I dreaded going to work.
good,"Great health benefits.  Higher management give employees appreciation luncheons and dinners to show appreciation.  Work life balance is nonexistent.  If you are management, expect to never have less than a 10 hour day working."
good,"The company is very serious about safety and being injury free.  It can be very difficult and hard work which may not be for everyone depending on the job you do.  But if you are willing to invest the time and several years, you will find opportunities to move up."
good,long hours good pay second sift was very long hours and then worked 45 days straight with no days off was aufull
good,"Tyson Foods is an OK place to work. Overall the best part about the job is  the people you work around. Typical days at work, is quite undecidable, but mainly OK."
good,the management was horrible to many chiefs and not enough Indians a lot of the time they are unorganized and i always felt like they made my life a lot harder then it had to be. the white people at Tyson are the minority so not a lot of people speak English but they did help me get on my feet as a single mother starting out with nothing so all in all the pay was good but in my opinon not worth the amount of work and bull we put up with in a day
good,I haven't worked there for years now. It was a very rewarding place to work. Back then. I learned a lot of my skills from there that has helped me on my jobs to date.
good,I enjoyed my employment at Tysons.  I was offered many opportunities to try new jobs and different positions.  The team I worked with was helpful and made my 12 hour days run smoothly.  Given the array of positions I was able to work independently or on a team.  The pay was adequate for the work I was doing.  I feel like the health insurance was affordable.

good,"Fortune 500 company that provides room for advancement and also offer great benefits. The company has a very productive work place where I've learned to work with a large group of people with different ethnic backgrounds. A decent amount of red tape and politics exist, but this is expected of a big company. A typical day at work consist of myself managing a group of Quality technicians whom monitors the quality of product by performing random sample testing every hour to ensure there isn't any defective product produced and shipped to our customers. I've learned to work efficiently with others while performing different tasks such as working on monthly projects, sending out multiple reports to all in house managers and managers from other facilities. The hardest part of the job is working long hours (12-13 hours) without any days off for months at a time. The most enjoyable part of the job is learning how to use new technology and techniques efficiently to make the job easier while producing a great quality product at the highest yield possible."
good,"Management is Slow to change and accept new ideas, but approachable and decent to deal with.  I've been able to advance fairly quickly within the company.  3 promotions in 4 years.  Pay could be better, but it's reasonable within the industry."
good,"be prepared to work 50-60 hours a week. if you can not speak fluent Spanish and English then good luck trying to become a machine operator no matter how much you express interest they will just point out everything you do wrong no matter how petty. its super cold and you don't move around much so its hard to stay warm and much easier to get sick. I did not enjoy working there, its not for everyone."
good,"I feel as though Tyson was not very empathetic to its workers, especially new-hires. Nor were they very sanitary in their food production policies. New hires were not properly trained or informed of job duties and/or how to accomplish job tasks. We were forced to ask repeatedly how to do certain things, and communication was terrible. The only good things about Tyson, that I saw, were the benefits."
good,"I worked for SaraLee Foods for 3yrs, I like that I was able to get health benefits the day I started. I worked with a lot of fun and friendly people. The area that I worked was very cold and required a lot of heavy lifting. I had great benefits up until the last year that I worked there when a lot of changes were made."
good,"Going in to work at 4:45 happy but by the time I leave at 2am, I'm completely tired and upset. As far as the job it's easy but standing all that time can be bad for your back. The management, I feel is not fair and all they care about is the chicken. I'm sure they care about us as individuals but not out feelings of how we are treated at the workplace. They just need that chicken to get done and put out by any means necessary. The best part of this job for me is the benefits and if you really want to advance, it's definitely possible."
good,Hillshire Brands is a company that will be there for a long time. Employees at Hillshire are able to work constantly.

good,my work enviroment is good my coworkers are the best just not making enough money not even getting 40 hours a week
good,Typical day at work was busy all the time. Management in plant always tried to get involved with maintenance work which made job harder. Co workers were good but didn't like working as an overall team. It was a good place for advancement
good,i had to make baking good foods. Then they got sent to the oven. We had to rotate every 20mins during the day so everybody did every thing that day.
good,This job will work you like crazy for little pay and no directions on how to do the job then turn around and fire you

good,i could be any where in my dept i can start off on the cone line and finish my day working in the freezer.My co-workers were ok no problems management ok at times not too helpful in some ways had to figure ways to do things on your own but that was not a problem hardest part was standing in one spot for hrs

good,"I loved working here. The pay was very nice and the benifit were outstanding. The trainning could use a lot of help. They don't have people who know how to train very well.  I beliveve if the did than the oputinity to work here would be out of sight. I also beliveve that they could invest in some interpersonal skills sets for the Top management. So of the upper staff is very rude and unaproachable. If not for those two thing, I would say that working for is company was out of sight."
good,"- Managed Supervisory paperwork and task "

good,"a typical day at Tyson foods would be arriving at work, filling the chicken barrier preparing for it to drop the chicken down the line so it would spilt up and shredded into chicken strips. the hardest part of the job would be actually sending pounds of chicken down the line at a time. most enjoyable would be moving around the warehouse to different departments learning different things. co workers were helpful along with management."
good,learned to work well with other co-workers. Hardest part of the job was to make sure that the quota was met each day.
good,"Unloading Products From Truck And Placing Product In to Freezer,Co-worker Teaming Up So We Can Complete The Job On Time And Have The Frozen Product Shipped Out To  The  Consumer On Time."
good,"A typical day would be to have a start up meeting and get pass downs from the crew before you, and figure out what needs done first and get it done . Then I would walk my area and make sure everything is in proper working order . Once that is complete then I will start to work on my work orders . My co-workers are great and so is my supervisor . The hardest part of my job would be having to carry a 30 lb belt of tools for 12 hours but other than that it was a good job .The most enjoyable part of my day is talking with production workers and building relations . Plus it also makes my job easy ."

good,"While I may not have preferred to work in a factory setting for my first (and so far only) job, I don't regret it. I liked the fact I could meet so many interesting people from such diverse backgrounds, and I made quite a few friends. I also liked the fact that the Supervisors would rotate lines every year or so. It helps to know that you're not permanently stuck with a boss you cannot get along with. I didn't like that the people that had been working there for a long time made less than the people that were new hires. I also would question"
good,"Tyson Union City is a relatively good place to work.  The compensation is good for this area, but the drawback is the number of hours that are worked on a daily basis.  There is no 2nd shift so when you go in to work you have no idea what time you will be getting off."
good,As a builder I enjoyed it but the job was too slow and everything broke down after awhile and you had to wait to get it back running and when I was running the machine it broke down only good thing it wasn’t hard to fix it was easy it was a push of buttons to get it back on it there wasn’t anything scanning the sensors.
good,"Tyson is a great company to work with,but they don’t have a good leader and a manager, they’re waiting to much production, manager are not supporting the workers,, for my opinion if they have a good management, the company not going to closed down"
good,Got plenty of hours and for the most part it was an ok place to work.  Would still be there if the company would not have sold this part of their business.

good,"Typical work day:"
good,"Tyson is all about safety, they’ll continuously show an teach you how to work safely. There’s a couple of management issues as far as communication but overall it’s a good work experience"
good,Tyson was a very good experience of a job. Love working there fast pace work. Very good people to work there very nice I had no problem there. Had to move
good,"I would say Tyson Foods is a good place to work if you're looking to acquire more warehouse experience. The management are professional and good to work with. However, the medical leave policy seems to be poor regulated for general labor workers. I worked at a food production line worker."
good,The benefits were great. Overtime was mandatory and required by all departments. The job is very fast paced but is easy to catch on. The cons to the job is being very cold and having little time off.
good,Fast paced job 10 hour days money was okay but felt company should have been paying more I enjoyed the people that worked there the department I was in worked together reason I left relocated trued to advance but they didn't want to move me because they couldn't keep a person in my job assignment
good,I learned to utilize my skills as been a team player and also how to commiucate with my team as a valuable player. And I also learn to work at a fast pace and be thankful for the skills that I incorporated.
good,Each day is different.  Some days very busy and some days extremely slow.  Increasing reliance on reporting instead of customers.  Some wonderful folks to work with.
good,I mean for someone who is looking to get fast money every week or just someone with the drive to get out and get it to experience life on their on it's great starter job

good,"Good full time job , good work Environment, good management,  Insurance provided. The only downside about this job was the drive at the time. Other than that great people to work with."
good,The hours are long and we work a lot of Saturdays at my location. Upper management also needs improvement in order for lower management to grow successfully.
good,Tyson is a place for men but women go in everyday and go hard for their family but that place is for people who really can't get a job anywhere do to there life style
good,"I liked working at Tyson, and i had no trouble until I switched departments. The manager there was unfair and inappropriate. When I brought the issue to HR, nothing was done. If it weren't for that I'd definitely still be working there."
good,Very fast paced. Must use affective time management. You can bid on job offers. They have great benefits that you can receive once you’ve been with the company for awhile.
good,Hard on yo hands and shoulders not enough time on break need better pay more people to work with better attitude and better supervision and better menus in the kitchen
good,It is a very labor intensive place to work. But the money is good for the jobs. Its fast paced and at times a bit stressful at times. There are some nice people to work with that are there for a living just like I was.
good,"I’m use to working in customer service based places so this was a change of pace for me. I enjoy what I do as a Safety Captin, helping team members. The management does not know how to talk to people, they are very rude. Depending on who you’re dealing with and what issues you have they make it hard to communicate with them."
good,"Tyson is a very great company to work but can get very stressful at times because of the people you work with.Overall, Tyson gives you an equal opportunity to become a very successful person."
good,"Not really poor management but rather poor supervising and leadership. I learned how to cut, pack, and ship out the product. very cultured. Hardest part about the job is the repetitiveness, enjoyable part the people you work with."
good,"you work so hard, and get paid but the supervisors are stressed out. just do your job and don't worry about anyone else. dont call in to many times either."
good,It was an ok job always busy when the machines were not down. some of the people are good to work with but as any job you do have some people who try and run you off
good,Fast paced workplace. Labor intensive job. Work is okay. Pay is decent. Not enough days off. Supervisors are decent people. The job can be very stressful.
good,Is A ok place to work in the beginning then they start taking advantage of you and for granted. I am not paid what I am worth for everything I do. I feel like I am everyone's personal secretary. Is time to go where my skills are recognized.
good,Good place to work wish I could go back.was a bad time in my life I need to straighten things out..got everything worked out now so would help me now.

good,its supposed to be a team atmosphere but lately it hasn't been and Ive went to manangement about it and they said that they were going to do something about it but never did.
good,Most jobs require you to stand in one spot 8 hours a day with your lunch breaks and bathroom breaks as time off of them.
good,management would not listen to front line employees regarding what customers were saying about the quality of services.  Prices of goods and services increase so much; customers moves from Sara Lee to other vendors
good,Good place to work and climb up in grade pay. You can bid into different areas. Forty plus hours a week. Five to six days a week. Management is shaken in some departments
good,"tyson decided to start using there own employees to do the yard driver job the trouble was they had no one that was able to do that job, it was contracted out to trans am trucking I worked for trans am and was asked to stay on with tyson at the same rate of pay. this is a 4 shift 24/7 operation. the manager on the shift I was on was ok you could talk to him. the hardest part of my job was working around the road drivers for tyson who always seemed to be parked in your way which made backing 53 ft. trailers into dock doors hard.getting 3 days of every week."
good,When I worked with them I always push my self to do better and to get things done there was time where people didn't won't to work that when lead step in but work it self was at time a challenge and you just got to set your mind to it and work hard like if it where my own.
good,"A typical day at work would be to put on my PPE, clock in and go directly to my line. Work in one spot doing the same thing for maybe 4 to 6 hours then get a 30 minute lunch break and do it all over again until my shift was done. Its nasty at times and smelly but its good money and has benefits."
good,Friendly team members and great benefits. Culture is very fast paced and stressful. If you do not enjoy stress do not work at Tyson. Production is very difficult at the beginning but get easier as you learn.
good,I was sometimes a backup lead for a line and other days I might be a backup oven operator. I usually did not know in advance what was going to happen for my shift.
good,Tyson Foods was a good place to work. Everything done at Tyson was on a schedule. Keeping all pieces of equipment working at all times was challenging but made for a good night.
good,"They do offer Vision, dental, and health insurance. They also have a 401k which they are also contribute to. There is a lot of opportunity for growth. They are also felon friendly. Their downfall is management they failed to show team members dignity and respect. That's just my observation overall. I don't have mini issues with that in my position."
good,Tyson was job security . People always need to eat. Tyson was fast paced. At times could be stressful. But I had to work and do what I had to do to put food on the table.
good,Tyson's have long working hours. You have to work 6 to 7 days a week. You have to work around 10 hours a day. You have to stand on your feet all day. The pay is good though
good,The team mates that work there are fantastic.  The home/work life balance is great.  Just not enough room for advancement with the company unless you are willing to relocate.
good,While I was employed there i was able to learn alot its a very face pace enviornment with many helpful individuals working side by side with you from the moment you start your work day until the last moment of the shift.
good,Tyson is a stressful work place. If u just looking for some income Tyson is the place . The supervisors don't care about their employees. Like I said it's a good job just for quick change.
good,Its a fast pase job must be ready to work n stand over 8hours and willing to have communication in work in a hot or cold area must be willing to hang chicken clean up cut chicken clip wings stack tubs
good,"I learned to drive an electric pallet jack, Work quickly and in extreme conditions, Hardest part is working 7 days a week straight for weeks. The new factory management listens to the workers to help make production helpful."
good,I worked for tyson foods for 6 years. Got a raise every year my first 3 months I moved up to being a lead person. Upon my departure I was training to be a supervisor
good,"Great benefits n hours management is not great. Is  a good work place and no weekends. Tyson have good people to work with n a good work place, but i learn alot."

good,Tyson's nice place depend on how you makes it. Break need to be a little longer. Staff was ok some I feel got a leader position for the money.  They benefits are great .
good,"Great people and a great culture.  Not the best floor managers.  I enjoyed working with the people and the vibe of the whole factory as a team.  They do little things to show their employees that they are appreciated, and I thought that was amazing."
good,"Tyson Foods can be a good place to work, if you make it into the good graces of the high-ups. They promote from within some, but you have to have a really good reason why it should be you. If someone else is a better friend to the managers, they will get first shot at the promotion. Lots of work available, but not every worker is given the same amount of hours. Pay is good, but not enough time to spend with family. It's a job, pretty much evens out in the end."
good,"Oversee trucks for shipping and receiving. Schedule appointments for receiving for the upcoming week. Building orders for shipments going out. Inventory checks for onsite and offsite facility. Work in SAP software to manage ship product from one facility to another."
good,"1.A typical day at Tyson was loud and fumy."
good,we started work with a safety meeting and prayer. the line began up 745 and we had lunch at 1145.. sometimes we would get off at 430 but agaun some days it wouldf be 6 .. work is hard and cold

good,"I would like to work there again some day,i got to work in the plant doing conedeboning,and i worked in the krp section where they kill the birds.i also worked in the garage"
good,Safety is applied in everyday process. I learned how to follow and let my leader guide me. Management wasn't always consistent and showed favoritism most of the time. My co-workers was awesome. They were more supportive than supervisors and leads. The hardest part of my job would be the travel to and from Tyson. Most enjoyable part of my job is when everything would go as planned and failing or needing to have a retest for samples.
good,Tyson had a very family oriented culture and the pay was okay during that time.  I can say I enjoyed working there and would so again if the opportunity presented itself.
good,"Show up on time. Float around from job to job as needed depending on what job was slowing down for that day or person was missing."

good,"Its alright a whole lot of drama, working. ON a assembly line with a bunch of women, sometimes fun.l really liked my supervisors. U get to move around when.your line isn't working."
good,I enjoyed it for the first 6 months but then there was no motivation from managers. A typical day would be pulling orders to load.
good,"management was good to work for when I was there that's been several years ago so not sure how it is now. made a lot of good friends there, hardest part of job was pay not very good."
good,This job was ok.I worked on the line and put boxes on a line.   I am a handicap person and I was not fast enough for them so they let me go.
good,hard labor good pay everyday was pretty much the same and also you will get messy and stinky but that's what comes with working here
good,Bad Pay but easy to work. management is not so great when you need something you have to go to corporate to be listen otherwise they ignore you
good,"Since you coming to work, they expect you to be working, they dont like when production stops, management doesnt care about employees too much, the only good thing is that major physical work is not required."
good,Tyson Foods labeling department has very long hours 6 to 6 or longer. Setting up the labels are easy but the repeat of picking up the whole birds and other chicken packs takes it's tole on the hands. My co-workers are great. Labeling got one scheduled day off during the week but they wouldn't tell you what day it was till after the first week and some told me they had to work two or three weeks before they was told theirs.
good,"When a line was down, there was extreme pressure on the maintenance department to get it 'up and running'. Our supervisor would most often back up our decisions though, and was concerned with more than just the bottom line."
good,"Workplace that allows you to be accountable for your own actions.  Decent amount of blame game when things don't go well.  Red tape abounds in decision making environment, but this is typical with most large companies."
good,"Cold work environment, fast paced assembly lines. Company closed down due to poor working conditions. Great Pay and benefits."
good,"Every worker trimmed a part of the meat on the conveyor belt. The environment was friendly and management was good, i learned how to cut meat, how to sharpen knives and how to work safe."

good,"Checking product, learn Usda regulations, learn Haccp, Train supervisors. Helping in the lab and doing training in the lab."
good,"Lets see how do I say this, I work 3rd shift at Tyson of Rogers..I try my hardest though pain to do my job,  Especially for not being properly trained to do that job, and probably cultureal differences in speech, anyway.   Basically I get yelled at pretty much everyday, coworkers, and supervisor are great.  Supertendant well he can be a nice guy but needs people skills during working hours.   And needs to make himself clear on what is going on instead of just screaming at you.   I like the job and all, but I want to be treated as a human being instead of being screamed at."
good,Job is not bad.  Room to change positions in the company. Great Benefits.  Management was ok just need to get on the same page with HR on what the policies are in order to better educate team members.

good,it was the night shift and had 3 days off per week. all the over time we could want
good,Work is very fast paced as well as tiring. Management is on task and does what is needed. Co-workers are well rounded and mostly friendly. Standing in one place is the hardest part of the job. The best part of the job is time goes by quickly.
good,"Waiting around for machines to break down/ fail.  Repair them, calibrated a lot of hand scales.  Long hours."
good,"I enjoyed my time working here , I liked my co workers all of them were very nice. The bad part of this is that if your working on reprocessing theres days that is really bad about the amount of chicken that the USDA is taking out. Other then that, its ok"
good,"I had to jobs at the plant, Some days I went in at 3:45 pm to be bacjk up HICCP Tech. Other days I was packer on the Line."

good,Enjoyed my time as an employee with this company. Obtained various skills & knowledge that I am able to use as I pursue my longterm goals. Great work environment with competetive pay & excellent benefits.
good,"Hard hard work. Supportive management with high chance to advance. Good benefits, but the work is very painful and hard to get used to. High turnover rate."
good,"Tyson Foods is a good job, I don’t feel like they pay enough for the hard work that has to be put into working in a freezing cold environment and some areas like in Live Hanging where the smell is very bad. Don’t get to enjoy your family that much around the holidays because you’re only getting that particular holiDAY off and return to work the next day."
good,"Benefits are great you can move up I'm working on deboned to being a GM so it's room to grow and move up in the company, does not take forever so my advice if you trying to work they will and pay you reasonablywork you and pay you"
good,Working here was a good experience and the hours were great. Supervisors were very fair and great to be around. Workplace is what you make of it . The hardest part about the job was leaving. Pay days are always the enjoyable!
good,not much to say but its a job. long hours and little time off for the holidays. Management is friendly. The hardest part of the job is doing what is expected.
good,"It's a good paying job but you have to get your rest. Work hours can be very unpredictable,  you do have insurance with copays but is great with dental and vision. I met some great people at this job.❤ "
good,"They high qualifications to meet, they have good standards for your needs you have to meet your production standard and they have good vacations days to earn and high point system"
good,"I would say overall Tyson's is a good place to work. You can manage your cost of living with the pay they give you.. Management however tends to play favoritism roles at times,I haven't had to go through it yet but I definitely see it happening to others. The other negative side to it is the department I'm in which is debone my hands tend to swell up alot often. I would recommend this job to so"
good,Tyson foods is a good place to work if you are good with handling stress. The management are good if you kiss there butt. if you stand against them they try and get you fired
good,"Pay could’ve been better ,show a little  bit more appreciatetion ,had good food breakfast and lunch,enjoyed when they fed us for the holidays,should’ve gave us some holidays off wit pay instead of working every holiday"
good,Tyson foods is a gud place to work I like it there the people is ok the have gud benefits u get 10 points the cafeteria food is gud they have gud supervisor
good,The job was ok it just that it was too cold and I strongly believe that it wasn't enough stuff to put on to keep warm. I found out that I was pregnant with my last daughter working there
good,Tyson is a good plave to work. Security system is good. Benefits and healthcare are at tyson. Tyson work together to get the job done. Tyson pay rste is good enough to live off of.
good,It was a good work enviroment they have good management their promoters are great it is a great place to work all around nice coworkers and everyone on the same page
good,"I learned a lot and willing to learn more ,I'm a team player that will be on time no mater the circumstances , with my different set of skills I can be"
good,"Alot of drama within the facility alot of favoritism. Hard to advance into management. Job security good, depending on dept. Alot of overtime. Management is not good."
good,"The willow plant in enid oklahoma dictates alot of what you'll do in life. Overall it is a great company, but at times it doesn't seem to bother the management team that we work 13 days straight resulting in 2 days off a month. They put a lot of stress on their employees especially the supervisors being one for almost 3 years has completely burnt me out because there's still no change."
good,"Best thing about here is probably that you work just 14 days a month. You get 14 points to use at 1 point per call off which isn't bad. Points are recovered every month of consecutive work. Two days vacation only for the first year of employment. Pay starts at $14.90 which isn't bad if you don't have any relevant experience. They hire felons and many inexperienced employees. They end up hiring a lot of screw ups which can inconvenience more competent warehouse workers. There are better paying warehouse options within 25 miles, wouldn't recommend here if you have experience unless you have no problem with extreme cold and wearing a snow suit. Warehouse is too small to house some of its product. In my time here there was no mandatory OT besides the Saturday every other week everyone is required to work. (36/48hr work weeks)"
good,A day at Tyson is I come in not knowing where I maybe for today. When they realize where I maybe I go to my desire station an work there for about two/three hours then move again to another situation. We have more then one mangers the work not hard at all .
good,Everything thing there is easy to work with! Nice people and easy jobs! They help you move up fast too! If the job is to hard they make sure to fix it!
good,arrived early ready to work chickens arrived I was the only female that hung birds on the shift I had. The bad side had to deal with hostile men that did not like a female there
good,Made great money. Mangers were ok to work along with. Worked to many hours a day. And took time away from family. Had plenty of opportunities of moving up the ladder for upper class.
good,Pretty good place to work. Could use better management. Would recommend to work there. Pay is fair the people are good. Management can sometimes be hectic.
good,A typical day at Tyson Foods consist of me feeding a line and placing a chicken on each cone. I learned how to feed the chickens on the cones on different speeds. Management made sure the line was running smooth. The workplace is cold and very busy. The hardest part of the job was the pain in my hands due using my hands over and over. The most enjoyable part of the job was the relationships with my coworkers and management.
good,"Go in work on the machine or do re-work."
good,It's a great job actually. If I made more money I would probably still be there! The work environment is ok! The work environment is good! I just didn't make enough there!
good,"I liked working with the people. My job was pretty easy. The Supervisor was really nice. The pay rate was fair. It was a really fun place to work in, and would go back if I was given the chance to."
good,Tyson foods was a great experience. They have unlimited opportunities. You have a fast pace environment that will help you in the future. Tyson foods gives you the chance to buy stocks.
good,Typical day starts with safety meetings and exercise then the workers go to their assigned areas in the departments and inspect machinery for any damages before the work day is started. production line is started and we run production until quota is met for the day.
good,"Many opportunities for career advancement with great benefit packages. Long, fast paced hours but with competitive pay. Need to be very detail orientated, teamplayer, motivated, and eager to learn new tasks."
good,"Loved working there for it was my 1st job since I moved to United States ,always all those around are very friendly and dedicated wonderful people to work with."
good,"busy,steady work day,on top of everything with the pace of work, and the regular paper work.Learned that companies do not play when it comes to making orders."
good,"* Learned how to maintain a line of employees"
good,Working at Tyson they have a lot of rules but what job doesn't the labor is very hard and the pay is horrible. The benefits is excellent though. The insurance is wonderful
good,"The compensation is not really high, but the benefits takes up the slack. It stinks because you are preparing fresh chicken. It has a good job work/life balance and a good work culture."
good,This is a company that works together and the management will stick together no matter what. The worker are over worked and under paid and unappreciated
good,"worked in the receiving dept. of the company. unloaded live chickens to be hung and processed. i recently relocated to stone mountain, ga. to be with family."
good,When it's hot it's hot and when it's cold it's cold. They take care of us but it could be better.  Management could help more and push for more stuff wee need. It could use a good clean and bug spray
good,"The work place started at 8:15am. You get your PPE on by 8:45am. Anything after 8:45 am you were considered late. We would do our daily warm ups (no one would actually take them seriously though), the Tyson chant after wards, then the Supervisor would talk to us about how we were low in productions. We were expected to do 8 pieces of chicken a minute. Everyone was expected to produce 4200 lbs per hour. We were averaging 2400-2800. I only worked there for about 3 weeks. I was finally averaging around 4-6 pieces a minute. I would say the supervisors, leads, and trainers were friendly. The first two weeks I was there I hardly could tell who the supervisor was. He was hardly in the picture but by the 3rd week he was up front and trying to get to know his crew. He was really friendly. I liked him. The only reason I didn't stay was because of the other general laborers. If you weren't cutting 8 pieces by the 2nd week they look at you like you were a lazy piece of dung or make snide remarks! What kind of work morale is that!? My trainer told me the first week, I was expected to cut 1-2 a minute, the 2nd week 3-4  a minute, by the fourth week or first month, I was expected to cut 8. You're basically building up your speed and quality of production. There is a high turn over rate but I blame it on the other general laborers. They make you feel terrible."
good,"The job was very hard work, but it felt great to be able to meet the challenge of the day head on. Be ready to work hard! Pay was good for the work type. Overtime was readily available for anyone who wanted it."
good,I have worked at this place for over 5 years but left because of my classes schedule. The job is fast paced with all the dangers that comes with working around machines.
good,Overall its a good place to work. Just a little stressful at times. Has a high turn over rate. Must be able to work well with others. The majority of task require team efforts. You are on your feet for about 12 hours.
good,"Tyson is a job we're you have to go prepared and ready to work, Tyson is a place were people are more important, staff are friendly and very helpful the hardest part of the job is learning how to do a new task but the easiest part is when you can do it after being taught... you have good days & you have your bad days but a typical day at Tyson usually turns out good, managers come to work to get the job done & the job is always done right on time."
good,"It is good place to work. There are a lot of opportunities in Tyson. "
good,The management could work better in making it a safer working environment. The supervisors also need more training to makeing Tyson a more productive work place. The employees that work there need to take more pride in the work they are told to do
good,Tyson was a very good job my staff members and supervisor  were the nicest people everyone got a long and worked as a team the job wasn't hard I did a lot of working with chickens and I can't complain about the job it was great.
good,when I was with them it was hostess the company went bankrupt and closed now has reopened as hillshire brands so I have no knowledge of how they operate
good,Job was good but the pay was lower than national standard for a Maintenance Technician.   As a maintenance Technician we had a very small shop hard to do repairs. Management was supportive though.
good,I learned how to socialize with others. How team work works. My co-works are more than satisfied with my work. My managers are very respectful and patient with me .  The hardest part of my job is safety. Anything can happen to me by accident .
good,It was a very demanding workplace.  It does have good benefits such as healthcare but working there does take a toll on your body on the long run.  Most employees are ok to get along with after they get to know you.  The same goes for most supervisors.
good,"In the 15 months that I have worked for Tyson, two people have been fired. My feeling is that termination was not necessary. They are good people that made mistakes. They do have lives that are dependent on their employment. People make errors."
good,The people I work with are always helpful. There is a wide diversity here. My curent supervisor is easy to get along with.I believe the hardest part of the job is my long commute.
good,"Just another stepping stone. I learned a lot, the tyson i worked for was very old so there for the equipment i was running was pretty old. A whole lot of hands on and manual trouble shooting."
good,there was no chance to rise in company the management would never be there if ya had a question or concern
good,"in my department guaranteed 40 hours of work, I've learned many new things that help me in my everyday life. Management is friendly.  Co-workers are friendly and helpful."
good,"Tyson Foods is a great family oriented company, the piers and management their are like family to me i have been apart of that facility for 8 years on July 10,2006 it was my first job."
good,"Depending on where you are at in the company the job can be good. Mostly its depending on the management. When I was in the QA department, I loved it. Great management, they taught you exactly what you needed to do and made sure you understood everything. Co-workers in that department were really nice and willing to help everyone out. "
good,"The jobs are easy. it is quite loud and cold in the plant, but if you keep moving and stay layered you will be fine."
good,"A typical day at work consists of throwing raw bellies into conveyors and hanging them onto the trees from which go into the freezer and then to the cooker. I learned some really good skills working here but I wouldn't recommend this job for anyone unless absolutely necessary. The job is very repetitive, you will a lot of health problems if you make a career out of it. The co-workers are just like anywhere you go full of drama. Hardest part of the job is showing up. There is no enjoyment in this job."
good,I enjoyed my Job at tyson meet some great people and enjoyed my job .
good,its a good place to start. there are many different types of people that work there.
good,"Depends on what your likes and dislikes are."
good,"how to work well with others and get along, how to work in a group setting"
good,If your willing to work then Tyson foods is a perfect job for you.
good,"As a mechanic its a very fast paced and challenging work environment . Day by day, while working at this job, i acquired many skills. Such skills: pneumatic and hydraulic/ trouble shooting. I also helped managed gear boxes and conveyors. also fabrication and welding skills. Many of my coworkers at Tyson foods are now very close friends of mine. The hardest part of my job there would have to be the new and unexpected challenges given to us every single day with having to work with machinery and the stress of trying to prevent down time on the production floor. The most enjoyable part of working there would have to be the feeling of accomplishment when, with all my skills and knowledge of the job, i'm able to successfully and safely complete an unexpected and time consuming task in a timely matter."
good,"My typical day at work Wed, Thurs basicly hang plastic all day long.. I have learned to work my hardest to get job done to move on the next job at hand, Management, or lack there of, i do not have a direct supervisor. This makes alot of headaches, Co-workers, or lack there of... crew is divided half on one side of the week works while the other is off, weekends are during the week. well management has not replaced the people that have retired or moved on.. The hardest part of the job is making up for the lack of people. Most enjoyable part of the job, well it would have to be getting off at 12:30 in the afternoon."
good,Good place to work when you are a team player. Good group of employees.
good,"a typical day at tyson consist of constant rotation. i learned alot about how to debone a leg quater in a timely matter. the management in the work place is very well organized. my co workers were very friendly. the hardest part of the job is getting use to the cold weather, and using different hand utencils that cause your hand to hurt. the most enjoyable part of the job is when the whole team come together to get the job done in a timely fashion."
good,I liked the environment. There was some problems with the way some things were run. There are things or situations where I think HR and supervisors could have done better.
good,Tyson has made a big impact on me. It was long hours and had other employees tell you what to do. Only had 30 minute break all day long and no other breaks in between.
good,Good. Start job for anyone who is not trying do bigger things in life the longer u stay the cold will do bad. Things to the body just cold inside the. Working
good,A typical workday at tysons for me was stressful because where I work it put a strain on my wrist and is causing my wrist to swell. Looking for a new job if all possible.
good,"The job I preformed for Tyson was difficult however I enjoyed it. I do not feel that I was paid fairly for my job performance, however my management team was awesome and always assisted with completing taskswhen we were behind."
good,"Use ppe"
good,"It was working at Walmart or Tyson Foods in Arkansas at the time."
good,It was a good place to work till I found something better it was a good stepping stone it is what you make it not the best place though but it got me through
good,"No tengo mucho que decir creo que el trabajo es bueno, aunque es mucha precion"
good,good place to work and advance in career. work a lot of hours but will learn a lot about business and if you are in the right career you want to be in
good,"Great place to work, friendly co workers and helpful supervisors. The hours for work are good. We get three and a half hours off with three and a half hours of work. Unfortunately there are no opportunities for overtime."
good,It was a good job I wanted to go back but I had moved out of town .it was really a hard in challenging job .but if u can hang on to it you can do it. Work hard play hard
good,"We would work hard and do what we had to do on a typical day. I learn how to do a lot of different jobs. It was a fair place to work at. The hardest part of the job was when the line breaks down, we would have to work overtime."
good,"Tyson foods offered great benefits...also supplied sick time, vac days, medical, 401k....worked mostly 40 hrs a week ....supplied. A well family living..."
good,"Working here was insanely stressful and fast paced. Your health isn’t much of a priority unless you were injured. So if you got sick on the job and had to leave work, you had to do several things before you could even get some days to rest and recuperate."
good,if you like to work your life away this is a great place for you. they work you 12 hours a day 6 days a week. You make great money but have no time to enjoy it with your family.
good,Had a good experience there and picked up some good trades and was able to move up in the company while I was there. Hard work will get you to the ahead.
good,I enjoy working at Tyson Foods and with the truck drivers. We are not getting but 25 to 30 hours a week and it is hard to live on that. Everyone on 2nd is easy to work with but they are experiencing the same lack of hours.
good,I didnt make much money but it was worth working there.  Many different cultures from around the world.  The management is fair and generally listen.  I actually had fun there.
good,"Overall decent work place with decent benefits. Can seem poorly led on occasion due to inexperienced staff. Production schedules are often changed creating down time, but maintains consistent work flows."
good,fast paced job and would have to adapt to cold weather. The most  enjoyable  part is working with others. The management team is easy to get along with and they are open to new ideas.
good,"A typical day at Tyson's would start with a department meeting. Discussions on what took place the previous day if needed and outlook and goal for the specific workday. It will involve a team stretching exercise and a safety goal or a injury that may have occurred throughout any of the facilities. The attention to safety is key in working there. Management is great on letting new and long-term employees know the areas where injuries can occur. "
good,"Poor Management. Fast paced and stressful, but not so bad once you get the hang of the position. Very one sided disputes. Union isn't worth the cost. Nice people, but will throw you under the bus if it benefits them."
good,"I would come in to a cold controlled environment and have to wear proper PPE, and sanitize my bump cap, steel toe boots, and hands before entering production floor. Depending on your department there are certain job schemes for each. Since I was in hot dog packaging I had 30 minute rotating job schemes, so that employees didn't get worn down. Then I would put hot dogs onto the loader, and take bad ones off, and put them into inedible yellow containers. Then I would rotate to drop station where I added, subtracted, or kept product even. I also had to straighten up product before it went through the automatic taper to prevent leaks, which caused bad packs that we would have to rework. Then I would rotate to the pack off station where we weighed product to either 10, or 12 pounds, and put product into a box that went down a conveyor belt to the automatic taper. Then I would rotate to palletizer where the box would go down to after weighing it. They had a job scheme for that as well. It was 7, 8, or 9 high, and 72, 80, or 99 boxes on a skid depending on product being ran. I would stack 4 high, rotate on each end, then stack 2 high, then rotate again, and then 2 more, and so on, but each one was different, because some had the middle open, and some had it closed. Then I would put a sticker onto a box on the skid for tracking purposes, and write down the time that I finished that skid on paper provided. Then another employee on a fork lift took the skid, and seran wrapped it for shipment. Sometimes I had to stay over and help 3rd shift finish product, so that they could sanitize the"
good,I would recommend Tyson to anyone who doesn't mind working hard and needs a solid career with plenty of opportunities for advancement and good benefits.
good,"i began my shift at 2;30 in the afternoon. from there its the same thing over and over for 10-12 hours daily, its the same thing over and over ,and over! if we worked 12 hours we would get out at 3 am. there is no free time because you will get home tired from picking heavy boxes bending over and squatting down 10-12 hrs a day.its extremely boring, only apply here if you intend to have no life, and would like to work mandatory overtime on your days off."
good,"Working for Tyson was an experience for sure! Although the pay is pretty good, the end of the day was unpredictable because you never know what time you're getting off."
good,It was a good place to work for. Only reason I quit is because transportation issues & I worked 2nds so a lot of overtime! I also got sick a lot in the summer because I worked in the cold so had to wear two layers of clothes & would sweat then go into the cold.
good,Nice people to work for and if you have any questions on anything people help you out and help make things easier for you to perform you job. They also provide any equipment needed to do the job.
good,"There are issues with the way it's managed but nothing major. They do try to take care of their employees, the facility, and the equipment. All in all it's not a bad place to work."
good,"Wish I would of gave it a longer try! Everyone was fantastic and fun to work with, even met my now husband there. I would definitely give it another chance."
good,"When I first came to Tyson , I expected the absolute worst. However, it was better than expected. The work environment is decent depending on where you work ."
good,"Everyone seemed to work well with each other. Nobody seemed to argue or make fun of anyone. We all deemed ourselves as equal to one another. It was an overall great place to work as far as the production people went. The management was the problem when it came to favoritism. We all were different in their eyes, and could not measure up to their standards."
good,"TYson foods is a place to make money. It is not a place to make a career because the labor is too strenuous. It's back breaking work and the conditions are ok, but if you want career Tyson is not the place unless you're corporate."
good,I hated the job so much I was making good money but the hours were hard on me I didn't like the management because they were very strict on us and the point system that they had sucked really bad
good,"This job is great but physically demanding and overall just hard all the way around. The pay is great but for every penny paid it is well earned. The work environment can be a little intimidating if your not used to working with people from different countries like Sudan, The Congo, Africa I would guess that the plant was 80-20 20 percent U.S.citizens the rest were refugees."
good,Fast pace calm work environment with lots of nice co worker and management. good benefits and vary easy to get promoted. Tyson food is a very good learning experience.
good,"Tyson was my first job, it was very hard for me at least . when working at Tyson I worked on the 2nd shift, it was from 3 until 3 . they money wasn't much but it helped. Tyson was very well managed an I had the coolest co-workers."
good,tear down and start up instrument department. learn how to observe different work situation safely. to answer down time of machinery. Mangement went through sudden changes how ever i continued my levels of education with the company and learned as i worked. the hardset part was the shift 3rd shift. the most enjoyable was the attention given by management of achievements by team members
good,Tyson is full of a lot of mess they will have you working really hard for little to nothing for pay. Some of the people there are nice but you have to be careful they have great benefits though
good,the best thing here is the pay and benefits and they will put your safety first and you had to wear all kinds of safety equipment and you had ten times to call in rated on a point system
good,Tyson was an overall great job they just had no real place for any serious advancement.
good,coworks where very pleasnt peopleto work with. Very fast hard laborer. Te hardest was cold and repeated motion. Easyest was knowing you worked hard and went home feeling great about yourself.
good,"Load boxes into trucks , heavy stacking, 12 hour days, learned various stacking methods and building layout. Management was good at setting goals. co workers were great. hardest part was heavy lifting all day. Most enjoyable was getting in a workout. "
good,"Great people to work with."
good,flip chicken in the freezer set hour and days.tyson chicken in arkansas
good,A typical day at work was purchasing parts via computer all day and occasionally helping a maintenance man with getting parts to fix machinery in the plant. I owe all of my hands on experience to working at Tyson. I was satisfied with the management at Tyson.
good,A typical day is making sure bones don't go any farther down the line done want to have an unsatisfied customer.
good,"high passed.m your night would go by very fast. you did not have time to look up. I love a on hands job and the faster passed it is. the more i like and enjoy my job. this job gave me hope to better things, just it was to far from home"
good,"This was my first employer and liked alot, but they sold out buisness and cut back."
good,Like job good work people where good too help out with everything you needed to know. The pay was good but for living in the city the pay was little hire then normal
good,My work place is a nasty place too work in. It is a chicken hatchery. We hatch baby chicken. I am the welder and maintenance man here. We have 3 other maintenance men.
good,"Tyson is a great company with reasonable  pay. I enjoyed working at Tyson. However,  the down part at Tyson is that the company do not pay lunch break and only a ten minutes break each day."
good,Tyson provides an equal opportunity for anyone who wants to advance with the company no matter what your education or occupation background consist of.
good,I worked at Tyson for 15 years they treated me like family an its a fast pace eviroment .I started off stacking boxes an worked my way up to production lesd
good,I worked at Tyson Foods for over a year and it was a fair paying job i just decided to find a job closer to where i live. The company offers lots of benefits and retirement programs.
good,I would prefer to be closer to home less of a drive and better salary. Also it would be nice to have a first shift schedule. Management is thoughtful and understanding. Work is fast paced.
good,"I Like The Job , It’s Just The People That Work There That Make The Job Very Uncomfortable . I Will Very Well Go Back To Tyson . A Typical Day At Work , It’s Chill & It Goes By Fast  ,"
good,There was a lot of overtime at Tyson. Often working seven days 8-10 hrs. All over time was required. Didn't leave a lot of time for a family life. It was fast paced and competitive.  They did train you well for the position you had.
good,"Tyson Foods Inc. Is a place of business, it’s well managed along with well mannered co-workers. It was a great learning experience for me it gave me a real good virtual idea on what “hard work” really is."
good,removing product from a freezer packing it up to be prepared for the shipping department. sometimes i would also give out help in other departments when needed
good,"I worked hear 3 years working with knife."
good,"Very good pay. Job is not very hard but it is very filthy. You also, will get a good 8 hour workout everyday. It is an assembly line for hanging live chickens."
good,"Hard work on your body. Cold conditions and repetitive work caused me to have carpal tunnel relatively quickly, in 3 months. They are understanding up to a point."
good,Can be very stressful but full of growth potential. Always availability to build career and continue climbing in the chain of command. Multiple areas and support groups exist to help fulfill job tasks.
good,"Tyson foods was difficult and interesting. The work was difficult, the environment was continuously wet, and the floor killed my boots often. "
good,"Tyson has great pay and benefits. Managers and trainer are nice and very patient and helpful. It's a hard job and even more challenging, but they make it worth while."
good,"got along with everyone , learned knife skills, friendly family environment. The point system sucked because if you cleared time off with your supervisor sometimes the machine wouldn't pick it up . So you would get pointed when you had that day off already and cleared it with your supervisors"
good,"Tyson Foods in Madison NE .Is a good place to work .You meet some good people there and form great friendships.However the management above a supervisor is lacking in a lot of areas.I have a great supervisor but that's about it upper management tends to nit pick about many things that are not even job related at all.Some people would say with power comes greed and that's what happens on the maintenance side of things.i can not speak for other areas of the plant i guess upper management never got the "" treat people the way you would wanna be treated memo """
good,"This is a good start for someone who has no more options. I love my supervisor and some of my co-workers. They keep me going and that's the only reason I'm still there. "
good,maintain and fix any down equipment learned alot about hydrailics gear boxes and augers aslo bettered my skills in tig welding and some pipe welding for steam lines
good,Its a great place to work with positive attitudes most of the time. I learned a positive attitude will make your job easier. some managers are influence you to keep reaching for your goal. the hardest part of my job is the heavy boots other then that everything else was fine. the most enjoyable part was they reward you when you do your job as its suppose to be done.
good,My typical day at  tyson i worked in the cold packing chicken and cutting chicken. The labor I did deserved a higher pay.Other than that i enjoyed working with my co-workers.
good,"A day at work was great in fast pace in keep you on your toes.  you learn alot about chicken in how the price ,weight and how they clean in handle to send to other stores in management keep you involve on wats going on with the product in the hardest part was keeping warm. I injoyed the hours they give you"
good,Good job with off hours typically same people in depts. every night with exceptions of when help is needed other places. Breaks were good two 30 min. breaks. Hardest part of job was repeated task causing pain and inflammation in joints. Co-workers were cool. Most enjoyable part of the job was not having to be stationary.
good,i enj0yed working for tyson i do like jobs that keep me busy so i have no linger time
good,Everybody has a jod in the completion of a day's work. When I was there the only thing I coul think about was going back home. Its a nice job to have if you can wait a whole year to be eligible for benefits.
good,"Worked hand and hand with upper managment, they were very helpful and teaching you all about the company."
good,Working for Tyson food was a great understanding. It was something new for me cause it was a quick paced. They were very understanding and very open minded to me. When I was sick they took the time to understand my absence.
good,We are a underpaid plant .... the benefits or good but they work you as if you have nothing else to do during the week. They don’t believe in letting you off @ a descent time so u can handle business you either have to come in late or leave early .
good,"packing loading good place to work team group hard job mix job uniform security, work some Saturday good benefits and great treatment they has an office to help the employeers"
good,I really enjoyed Tyson they will let you work all the hours you want to work and make as much money as you. Management is not that bright but they are good at the blame game.
good,I've learned that it is a great company that thinks about its people. I think that they had a great group of people to work with within the company I would definitely go back.
good,Tyson is a nice place. It’s just they do too much in debone! They make you come in a hour earlier some days not thinking about if you have someone to get your kid(s) up for school in the morning.
good,You pack whole bride u route u stand in one stop all day they pay 11.50 can go up I got 10 point  work everyday  some weekend off help put u in school
good,Good job if they gave people their raises. I was a lead and they never gave me my raise it would be a good company if they handled they business other than that it would be fine
good,great work place nice people great at getting u yo become compitive it was very vold in my department which i  loved taught mr how to work well in freezing temp aeas
good,Fue buena empresa solo que no dan la oportunidad de crecer al trabajador
good,don't really enjoy but it pays the bills if you don't mind doing the same thing every day this wold be ideal job but Me I'm looking for growth turning a job in to a career
good,"* A typical day i go into work everyone usually happy to be there, we work hard to unloud the trucks and go home."
good,"A typical day a work for me was ok. Come in at 8 in the morning, have to be on line 9. The only breaks we had were a 30 minute break at 10:30 and the last one was at 11:30. So we worked non-stop for 5 hours no more breaks to use the restroom or anything. "
good,it was a good job until I found another and they give you good pay but they are not a good company to work for if you want to advance up in the company unless you can handle a lot of stress. if you can then this is your job. but if you cant handle dead chickens then leave this one alone.
good,"If you can handle the cold then this is an amazing place to work. I've learned so much about different meat products. Some of the management is very nice but others are rude and don't care. The hardest part of the job is standing in the cold, but you can make some amazing money doing it."
good,I was to be at 30mins befor time to strat up the line and see if all the workers came in. I treated my co-workers like I wanted to be treated so we had a good great understanding. I fill in when was needed I supervised when was asked.
good,"TYSON is good campany there care about people there have good safey "
good,I learend alot working there met great people and made good money weekly and i worked there for two years. I had alot of good times there and worked alot and hard
good,"i had good cday and bads at tyson and i learn alot in doing different job,but i maintaine my dedication to job no matter how stress it ge.tthe company is a great place to work."
good,this company is a good work place for some one young and full of energy. You must be prepared to work 6 days a week almost 13 hours. It has great benefits from dental to vision. Also it has life insurance policies and more. Working here had it's advantages and disadvantages. But you must be upbeat and ready to work for this type of job
good,"I feel we worked at big company and we worked with other people, different country, different religious and different language. we communicated each other and respected each other."
good,"I enjoy my work and it is not hard, the hardest part of my day is getting relieved to go to the bathroom and waiting for equipment. I was told by management to shut down my line if no one relieves me, but I don't, I wait. I get along with all of my team members. The drive to and from work is getting to me if I had someone to carpool with it would make it better."
good,My opinion of Tysons is that they worked lots of hours which I liked and they let me learn as much as I wanted to learn and was willing to learn.
good,It's an ok place to work.  Pays good for the work you have to do. Some management   know how to treat employee's and some don't.
good,"Working at Tyson Food, it was a challenge for me. A typical day at work had to packing tortillas at the line with a co-worker than we had to put then in boxes, than another group would ship then out. I leaned how hard is to work in a factory my rest to every one who works in factory. I learned to manage my job. My co-workers we all worked as a team. The hardest part of the job was first week of training.  The most enjoyable par of my job was been had to go home early.  "
good,"Learned the right way to cut product, Made tons of friends. The most enjoyable time was when I worked in maintenance."
good,I did my job as I was supposed to. It had it's ups and down just like every other job but overall it was good being there. I enjoyed working with everyone over the years
good,Although I hated the company for what They did to me I would recommend this company to anyone because they have great benefits any you chose how much benefits you get this is the safest company I have worked for they try to get you motivated in your job.
good,I really have nothing bad to say because it really is a good job. The only thing that I wish they would increase is the pay because your doing a lot of hard work for o pay. But this job is great.
good,It was a family-oriented company with long-term growth with great benefits and incentives again as I said above I was able to obtain many different skills and able to utilize them not only at Tyson but if I am considered at the job that I'm applying for now
good,The hardest part about working at Tyson Foods were the hours but I was only working two days out of a week so it was not that bad at all. I have leaned that working at a place like this you have  to be very careful at what you do.
good,"A day at work consist of meeting a daily quota, which can be very pressuring at time, employees had to meet 95% minimum or can go above for incentive pay. What I have learned while being employed @ Tyson Food is how to operate a forklift, trained to work as a billing clerk and a dock/ freezer cleaner. My co-workers were 95% men and some days can be very difficult for me as a 5ft 2inch lady and that is also the hardest part of the job because I had to put in so much more effort than a man have to (work twice as hard) I accomplished everything and also the temperature was -10 85% of our job. The most enjoyable part of working was that senior Management related to there employees as the humans we were not as employees, also every scheduled working day Senior and Middle Management would have a meeting before we went out to the warehouse. Management were sociable like, watch tv in the break room, played dominoes with other employees. I like being paid every week with a pay that I could live and play off of.Freezing cold and numbness of the hands also wearing at least 20 lbs of gear."
good,tyson was a great place to work at and sadly it had to closed down. you have to get use to the cold environment and standing on your feet for hours but the staff makes it better.
good,good place to work great benefits great pay lots of diversity and good quality of place to work in Great 401 k plan and stock plans to invest in. Human place for animals
good,"A typical work day at Tyson was very very unpredictable, I learned to keep personal and business separated, management barely show them , the hardest part of my job was that it was very drama filled."
good,Tyson Food Service with a part time job for me I really liked it because it was slow paced higher up employees managers they were professional hourly co-workers were not
good,"clock in get smock"
good,great place to work should apply all of the people are you will have to go in with positive vibes and attitude the manager and employees are all great people
good,a fast paced company and the maintenance department that I worked for the upper management needs work but all in all a ok place to work and it gave me a lot of knowledge I can take to my new job where ever it may be
good,"Recruiter lied about the miles I could get in a week and the time I'd be out. Dispatcher flat out said he couldn't get me more than 350 miles a day, and that he never had drivers out less than 12 days."
good,When I worked for Tyson Seafood in Seattle at Pier 91 as the plant controller; I enjoyed the plant and the people.  Overall it was part of the chicken piece of the company and they tried to sell fish (something they knew nothing of).  They shut the plant and we were all of work.
good,"never work with Hillshire Brands, I don.t know never work there"
good,Clock in and wait for the line to start to begin hanging chickens
good,"Guard vehicles"
good,"Company is now sold, a lot of things happened there and things came to light via the news and they were sold."
good,"I am always ahead of my time, to check if everybody is on their duty. Make it sure that from time to time, processing of chicken is continuously doing by the workers. I learned to be more patient, more flexible in doing more works at a time. Management is good but benefits are less. Working with my co worker is good and happy. No hardest work for me, I believe. Everyday is enjoyable."
good,"Once again, it depends on who the manager is.  Some are too much and then, some are strict enough but, fair.  It also depends on what position you are given.  We worked in a very cold environment(some colder than others) but, they would give you the equipment to bear the temperature fairly.  They did keep you safe as well and, were good on safety wise as well.  Fairly friendly co-workers to work with, mostly foreign so, sometimes difficult."
good,"My day consisted of long hours very hot temperatures. Friendly co-workers, management was easy to get along with for the most part."
good,Maintenance department works 4-3 schedule and I have learned a lot about management and how the system works. I like my job and how it keeps you busy all day. The hardest part of my job is sometimes trying to track down the problem and keep the production line running. My co-workers and everyone is great to work with.
good,you go to work and work hard and your day will bed just fine then you go home and wait for the next day to start
good,"My day begins with me clocking in at 2:00 pm to set up. I get knives, scissors, and mesh steel cut gloves then to the cooler to get tubes and lids for the hearts, mutilated birds, and cut up wings. I make labels and place ice in appropriate places. I help check birds, cut wings, clean birds, empty vats, give breaks, and get ice through out the day until its time to go home. I'm on my third pair of boots cause I walk so much."
good,"production lines must meet there goals everyday must keep up good work habits, hardest part of the job is the cold eviroment"
good,It was nice to work for Tyson Foods Incorporated. My co-workers were a great help in helping out. I would say it was all about team work when we did things. The hardes part of my job was when the chicken would not cut coming through the blades and you would have to cut it. The most enjoyable part of the job was having people help you out.
good,its an ok place to work its a good work environment with alot of cool people.
good,long hours and repetition worked many weekends and very late nights. goals are set and then met and then goals are raised it is no a win situation except for the big wigs
good,"They do not care about anyone that comes through the door. They say it's family based, but they could care less about you the individual. Most of the people are nice to work with but there are some that are just there to try your patience. Management picks their favorites, while others work harder and go the extra mile. The only thing I liked about the job is that I made a lifetime of friends."
good,"do preventative maintenance in their hide plant,learned a lot;how to fix the machines.management is alright, but they don't abide by their own policies.I got along just fine with my co-workers.hardest part of the job,too many bosses.most enjoyable;actually doing the work they had scheduled that day."
good,overall tysons was good to me they kept me working steadily even when i didnt want to
good,"A typical day at work clean and sanitize tools, set up lines fix or repair anything that needs to be repaired before production starts, continue to monitor lines through out the day if come across problem try to fix it during break and not cause down time for production"
good,If you walk up to your supervisors car to ask a work related question and he is doing drugs in the car it doesn't matter to human resources department or the manager cause he's a good worker. The same worker whom caused a catastrophe on a Thursday night which caused pack-out dept to work an extra 5 hours to fix under frozen product and the day shift had to come in on a Sunday making them work 13 days straight
good,Can't say much bad bout our Nations food supply folks. Top notch. But every dime that makes it to ur pocket you had to wrestle them keep.They didn't care enough bout you to lie to you and then when u go all the way to the top they lie to even him and say they ain't .  when they know they are. Horrible Managers. Lazy workers ..
good,Tyson food is a very large company with great benefits.. It's a safe environment for workers that want to work. You can learn a lot with this facility. It's a clean company and as a employee at Tyson we all are family.. If we had worker to come in with a positive attitude and leave the drama behind it will be so much better..
good,"Tyson in itself is a great place but the management at the Ames Nebraska location is terrifying.  No positive energy, doesn’t follow rules that are set, abuses work vehicles from what they are meant.  Ect."
good,Communication sucks from management to associate. The pay is great. It’s very cold. Third shift cleans so if you get wet u will freeze fir the last part of the shift.
good,"I spent a lot of years there. lots of rules, very structured work place management only cares about you being there and getting the job done.  you are just another number at tyson foods.  show up every day and do your job and you can make a paycheck. that's it."
good,Easy to get hired on. No requirement on education or experience. Not many advancement opportunities unless you really have friends in high places. Bosses and their buddies from school all work together and will cut you out of extra work or time off. Got to really kiss butt to move up.
good,"Tyson is a good place to work if you are motivated and can work independently. The work hours are not very family friendly but there is adequate compensation, benefits and some opportunity for advancement. If you are unable to perform in the job initially hired for, there are many different departments. Management is not always very positive, and there is often conflicts"
good,Tyson foods is a alright place to work and get by on until you find or start realizing it's time to look for an advancement or it's not a workplace for career seeking..
good,"I enjoyed working for Tyson. They were very understanding and reasonable when it came to scheduling. If you wanted more hours or less, days off ect. They were professional but also were lenient when there wasn't any thing to be done. I loved the people I worked with there, it was like we were very close and if anyone needed help they were willing to do so."
good,Could do better when it comes to advancement for Co workers. Could pay more for the work they allowing as wanting the workers to do.  Break could be a little longer
good,Good start for getting on your feet. They choose who to advance and who not to advance. If it's not you be prepared to stay at entry level with entry level pay for years to come.
good,"It ok, the management has really change and it seams they favor certain employees , they should have gave each and every employee the same treatment and I was the only one terminated"
good,"Empresa boa pra se trabalhar, mas de horário muito rígido e rotina estressante."
good,it is a good job I learned how to operate forklifts and skid loaders some supervisors are really good
good,Working at Tyson was very mentally and physically draining.
good,a typical day was not knowing which department you were going to be working in. i learned how to inspect different products. i learned how to drive a forklift. i learned how to operate a shrink wrap machine and lots of other machinery. the people there are great to work with. the hardest part of the job was learning all the different machinery. the most enjoyable part of the day was break time and getting to know my co-workers
good,Human resource department could have done better at keeping medical files up to date
good,I enjoy working for this company but I am looking to get out of the factory. I am a 20 year old college student and my class times have changed and Tyson has not allowed me time off to continue taking my classes. I am looking for a job with day shifts and that would be willing to work with my college schedule as needed.
good,Loved it but new gpm I didn't get along with. it's a good place to work I would go back but moved away.very cold but worth it but they need new management
good,Work there is really easy if you can handle the heat/cold weather oh and the bad smell that be in the air then you can pretty much get over the smell .
good,I worked for Tyson for 13 years the people I worked with were mostly good people and made lifelong friends. The plant I worked in was badly managed mainly in h.r. scheduling and plant manager positions. All in all it wasnt a bad place to work no place is perfect that I have found anyway.
good,"they rush you to the production floor , Ive learned how to work on different machines & equipment. The workplace culture is a nice environment my job is very easy. I just wish my line had more than one floor man."
good,"maintain machinery, have learned quite a bit in my years working here, management is fair. the most enjoyable part of my day when all machines are working"
good,This was an okay job. About my only complaint about the job was the supervisor that I work for. Which was the reason why I left. Come to find out not too long after I left he got fired.
good,I would work in the cold room packaging the meat and also help coworkers . Also we would help people when packaging  the meath to another room . Dont recall the rest
good,had to work on average 55 hours per week do to no help and poor management no training in field of study that i was working in when hired on in 2014 was told within in year would be sent to ammonia training . wouldnt hire on enough help to have full crew.
good,Would love to have my job back ...I believe I was good at my job I would like to talk to someone about it and get back to the workplace I'm a hard worker
good,the job was OK but very hard for advancement any time in the less then five years  but the job was an alright till they  discontinued  my job or i would have stayed
good,its a decent job if they can learn how to treat employees better. The pay is good....fro a chicken plant. Its really about who you know there as to how you will be treated.
good,Lack of communication but the best part for me was working alongside some of the most hard working ladies and gentlemen i have ever met. Very fast paced and  can get extrey congested.
good,"No PTO. Management doesn't put their foot down, office staff runs amok. Hard to get days off, you have to use your vacation days first and are allowed a few days per year of unexcused leave."
good,"A rigorous workplace which has provide my work experience with production strength, speedy product production, and work endurance."
good,"Typical day starts off smoothly"
good,Working for Tyson Foods was a good experience. I learned many things while employed there. I didn't have that many co workers only a few because i worked in shipping and i enjoyed working with them. My job consisted of shipping out products and doing paper work and i enjoyed that also. Some management was fair and some was not. The hardest part of my job was the working environments.
good,very helpful co worker easy work but stressful poor management
good,"Excelente escuela para administrar personal"
good,"It was hard repetitive work, but Im a hard worker. I enjoyed working for this company"
good,12 hours constantly standing only 1 30 minute break during the day.
good,"The job is fantastic pay and the work doesn't require a brain if you are on the line. The benefits are fantastic but that doesn't make up for the way some supervisors carry themselves. if you are not favourited then your voice will not be heard. Higher up in management towards Plant Manager and Human Resources your voice will be heard but more towards Corporate they ignore you completely. That needs to be worked on, but other than that the job itself is great if you don't mind working long hours and not seeing your family much. I made some good friends there."
good,It was a challenging workplace. People everywhere out to get each other. Management there was fine.
good,"The give employees due diligence in learning new task . Everyone is treated equally, I would recommend other to Tyson as a career. If I had a chance being more mature now I would go back to work there."
good,"Good job with good benefits, very limited advancement with preferential advancement instead of best qualified candidate! Stereotyping comes into play with promotion."
good,Overall good but didn’t like working every weekend. Also equipment was in bad condition. Co-worker was willing to help everyone even when the morale was down.
good,Good place to work friendly people.nedds new supervisor.. I love my job just dont understand why such a strong place have such week minded employees. Would like to see better management.
good,The pay is really good but if you work in pack out your chances of having to stay overtime is most likely. Third shift is a pain because you rarely have any time for yourself
good,Good place to work..the only downside is you get wrote up for bathroom breaks 3 and fired.. you have to leave the floor..so new smoke gloves wash boots hands and get dressed again takes to much time that's reason for write up..
good,"This is an exceedingly difficult job. It's hands-on, sometimes gross and smelly, and the corporate people are just brown nosers to beat all. The pay is great and the benefits are superb. However; if you're part of the LGBTQ+ community in Indiana, I wouldn't suggest working here."
good,"Third shift is a difficult lifestyle to balance for anyone working at any company. However, I feel it is important to offer more than 2 days PTO per year after your 90 day probation/training period. Especially since a lot of similar job opprotunities offer 1 week paid vacation upon hiring date including a higher hourly pay rate even for entry level."
good,"Poor pay, requires 50+ hours a week to make ends meet for a bare lifestyle, promised promotions to only be passed up for outside, lots of required holiday work due to the nature of the business."
good,"It’s a good place to work, good benefits, only downside a lot of work. Very stressful depending on your position. You have to deal with a lot of difficult coworkers."
good,It wasn't a bad job but it wasn't a good job either. Not a job I would recommend to someone who have little ones and little to no help. It is a place where they do try to pay for the work you do. There is room to grow in the factory. Missing days is possible but it can get one terminated after a certain amount of points. You can meet all kind of people from different walks of life. You have managers that are there to help and are about doing what's right. But you do have some who are only there for a check. The best part about Tyson is learning with Peers and making more money by growing in the company.
good,I liked working there I just had a lot of stuff going on at home! I had a lot of deaths in the family! Which caused me to miss work and that's why I lost my job! Because of my points!
good,The company has its advantages and disadvantages. Management and the supervisors make an attempt to separate themselves from regular hourly employees and often times when they see that you are advancing to quickly they find a way to block training or they deny training.
good,"I have nothing to say good or bad its a job. Its like any other job you have to be on time, do your job, and go home. It 9 hour job sometime 8 hour. Its really not a bad place to work but not a good place either."
good,Very flexible with schedules.  Management needs to have more authority to enforce rules.  The people I work with make the job enjoyable but I also really like the job that I do.
good,Personnel at Tyson tend not to do anymore work than they have to. They do just enough to get by. The managers see this but are unable to do anything about it because of HR.
good,Tyson Food provided an opportunity for me to grow outside of my norm.  It was factory work environment.  Productive was up and down.  The work environment could be toxic if you allowed others to do so.  Management appeared to be unorganized.
good,Not a bad place to work. Communication is a slight problem due to many different nationalities. If working in fabrication the cold temp can get uncomfortable. Management does a decent job communicating between employees.
good,Lack of communication throughout the whole planet.  Lack of accountability. Lack of pride in the employees.   should start quota incentives.   Empower the vision
good,a typical day at Tyson is work work work and if the supervisor don't like you eventually they will fire you. Team members are  but some don't listen and they take u to HR
good,This job has alot of hours to give as long as you want them.the benefits are great and youth get alot of discount and perks working for them they treat employees fairly
good,It's not been ran right because they run people off everyday there a new paper rule that we gotta sign off the half tell us what's going on with the company Tyson isn't a bad work place I just wish that they would have some people that cared the hours of opration change its just crazy how the other second shift comes in and we're still there working and the waiting to take our place but the lead or supervisor will stop the line and say that's it it just crazy
good,You were on the property 10.5 hrs. but you only got paid for 9.5 hrs. there was two 30 minute unpaid breaks per shift. Raises were given every year but were taken back in insurance premiums. Tyson has their own insurance network so you pretty much have to do as they say. They also charge you extra premiums if your spouse has their own insurance through another employer and if you use tobacco products. When I left they were talking about charging for employees who were over their body mass index.
good,"Lots of freedom in workplace, very automated position so little manual work.  Boring if you prefer to be busy at all times. Excellent work life balance."
good,"It is a busy pace job and sometimes, laid back job.  Be ready to work overtime whether you want to or not or you won't work there for long.  There is a lot of craziness such as game playing that goes on in there as far as employee and employers.  It can be stressful.  A lot of unprofessional people in top positions."
good,Tyson is a good company to work for. Provides excellent benefits and professional  They try to be the best and efficient company possible. Nice hours and shifts to fit your schedule.
good,"When I started working at Tyson Foods 13 years ago, it was a different culture.  ""We treat you like family"" was taken to heart.  Now the company has had a cultural shift that takes it to more of a ""corporate"" environment.  I'm ready to get back to a small business environment."
good,"great hours, good pay, clean , friendly co-workers, hung and dropped dry sausages produced pepperoni and other dry sausages"
good,i cannot answers. these working is more Whole day and never end. total 4k to 6k per day chickren. it mean out of control. if you keeping working.
good,Good co-workers and management cared about their employees.  The hardest part of the job was that it was always cold and wet.
good,"Overall good place to work, there is lots of opportunities for overtime, had the chance to show my leadership skills. The people and management are at times hard to communicate with"
good,"Employer that offers plenty of overtime. Tyson company. Focus, produce, strive. Continuous improvement offers chances for management/ employee engagement"
good,"Fast paced work environment with a safety oriented management team. The most enjoyable aspect of the job is learning from my co-workers. There was always something different to each day, it never got monotonous."
good,"The microbiology lab at Tyson foods provides steady work and good pay."
good,Management decided about 88 days into my employment that the company needed to loose some of its expenses and they decided maintenance was the place to do it even though we were already undermanned. However the maintenance section was a wonderful experience and I hope i find another place with that caliber of people.
good,getting to work requires a weeks (payed) orientation. this job has a bit of a learning curve and a lot of safety equipment as it is
good,"Found good people so job wasnt bad. Found my rhythm and became one of the best hangers in the plant, rating at 56 birds per minute. And thats 3-7 pound birds"
good,"not challenging enough"
good,"work as a team on most things, at times work on your own. get on  the job training as to what you are going to be doing, easy to get pay raises as you test up the pay scale"
good,got burnt out working at a meat proessessing plant always had to work on sundays
good,Tenias que lidiar con gente que no es nada profecional y aprte no estan impuestos a seguir instrucciones laborales.
good,"Typical day at work is managing 70 people for 12 hours everyday."
good,not family orientated the keep the driver out for a period at a time my brother had a stroke and It took me 3 weeks to get back home that was enough for me
good,"para mim foi uma das melhores empresas até hoje, por que tinha chance de crescimento, e um bom companheirismo entre todos os colaboradores."
good,"I case picked, palletized, wrap pallets & drove forklift as well low lift machines."
good,"Directly responsible for accounts from Tennessee, Kentucky, and Mississippi"
good,Enjoyed working with a friendly group of co-workers. It is a great place to learn hands on . But the demands are high.
good,Meet good people to work with and the work environment is great as well. Learn a lot working at this company. The trainin that you recieve from the job is good.
good,"Great company to start your driving career. Home time when you want it. Straight forward dispatch, not forced. Do have to wait around for loads like that."
good,"Management poorly ran so far. The factory was recently bought by Tyson foods. It’ll take a while to adjust to changes , but management has got to change."
good,Tysons a great company benefits are good and The employees feel like family every body respectful and  I learned the shipping and receiving part of the company
good,This was a great job great benefits and good pay. The only bad thing was traffic in the city other than that I would recommend thia job to anyone looking for a good place to work
good,Great pay and benefits. This is my second time working here and they have truly improved. The management team shows a lot of concern and help in many ways.
good,It would be a great opportunity for someone starting fresh into the factory field. Pay every week is very helpful.  A little more pay for the amount of work would be better
good,I would continue to work for Tyson Foods Incorporated if they were not eliminating my position and essentially forcing the decrease in my annual income.
good,Tyson is really a great company to work for. The pay is usually one of the reasons that's make you stay long. I cut chicken on an assemble line and make sure are cuts are 100% accurate l.
good,"clean environment"
good,Pretty good company pay wise just do your job go home overall the company is great just don't try too make friends be a team player and keep it professional
good,I would recommend this job to others. They pay good and they give you your hours and everything. I hate I had to leave my job. But I would definitely go back there and work again
good,Ran icing machine. Management was helpful.The hardest part is having to work in different departments. The most enjoyable part is meeting new people and making money.
good,Packaging department has long hours that are not set. Some Days you can work 6hrs other 12 plus... They don't care about ones Family Issues or responsibilities...
good,"Its a nice place to work fi you could get past the smell at the doors. management is pretty fair. Some of the work is harder than the rest, but its understandable."
good,I have worked there for about 4 years on the 3rd shift. like every job there are easy days and there are hard days. you can get as much overtime as you want.for the most part.
good,"I like working with people, I’m bilingual. I show up to work 15-20 minutes early. Only time I miss is if I have doctor appointments. Other than that I work and won’t miss"
good,Very good place to work for easy they are  background friendly they have good benefits and very flexible with hours and a good work environment for hard workers
good,I really like to work hard for what I want jobs are hard to get you have to value good things in life without work we don’t eat I been without a job for 2 years
good,Less stress as before but much less pay as well. Very relaxed atmosphere. Learning a lot about putting chicken on the table for our customers. Much more complicated than  one would think. I really enjoy that they company appreciates their growers so much! They really recognize the back bone of the company.
good,"A very laid back environment... Very multi cultural... Great benefits...discounts, stocks...and so much more they offer as a company... Good vacation and sick time as well"
good,"Tyson as a brand, a company is amazing. It is family oriented and Tyson really helps you with just about everything in your personal life such as school. They have a helping hands program also if your family is in need. Not all jobs there are easy and every facility is different, I have had the opportunity to work at two and they are complete opposite. If I had to review either one in particular then I would give them a really low rating. I came up and made good money and had a promising career. I quit cause i felt that I was not valued as a supervisor. I worked there for 6 years and never called in sick or missed work with out being excused. I needed a new shift that would accommodate me having a new baby and after 6 months of trying I gave up."
good,"Its a productive workplace very unorganized place to work, was a clean environment and the people was productive an joyful but did meet quota when needed"
good,"Lots of room to move up or around,  the pay is way above minimum wage. And you have lots of opportunities to get raises or promotions, because they go by experience first."
good,"I learned that I can do anything that I set my mind to I wasn't with the Company long and I was promoted to Lead, a typical day at work was usually pretty smooth for the most part but it had its days just like any other job."
good,"A lot of overtime every week,six or seven days a week.when I retired ,they did nothing even I worked for them nearly 30 years.Seems like they was out to make money-not friends."
good,I worked as an intern for the safety office so I was not given much opportunity to do much of an actual job there but the overall experience was wonderful and I highly recommend for those in need of a job wanting to find well-earned work.
good,"Cold work environment, fast paced, long hours, occasional layoffs.  Opportunity to develop various skills including: packaging, inspections, good house keeping, lots of opportunities to learn different jobs throughout plant."
good,I loved my job I learned a lot about conveyor systems and pneumatic systems. Worked on electrical components as well as all the ins and outs of bearing upkeep.
good,Having great team members work for me makes my job great. The job is very fast paced and non stop. The work to home life balance is difficult due to third shift hours and most weeks are six day work weeks.
good,"The job itself was decent, but you will constantly have overtime and almost only have Sundays off, take this into consideration if applying here, as you will have very little free time to spend with family or friends"
good,"I absolutely loved working with some of the people here. Human resources understood me a lot. A lot of Spanish people, but they were nice. Just hard to communicate with them."
good,"I work in the freezer "
good,Working at Tyson you have to work at a pace to keep up with the production line. When the line starts running everyone must be in their assigned positions.
good,Tyson has high expectations for its management but the company is very appreciative to rise who do well. Salaried team members are even paid extra for more than five days of work. Benefits are good also.
good,Tyson has great benefits and the pay is better than anything you will get in the area.  The work is not hard its just really repetitive.  Depending on your job it is a slaughter house so there is no way around getting dirty.  The worst part about the job like anywhere else is the people.
good,Working as a team was rewarding. I was given opportunities to learn new methods of management.  I also had the opportunity to interact with many International cultures.
good,Tyson Foods is a strong resource driven company that provides opportunity for employees to advance skills and knowledge. It can be a challenging opportunity with the work load but extrinsic and intrinsic rewards are given.
good,Good place to work. Always posting new jobs there with the potential for advancement. Fast paced but fun friendly work environment. Management will treat you right as long as your a dedicated worker and come to work every day.

good,tyson is one largest beef meat company in the world .tyson to tear down up to 60 thousants of beef a day . but there is no discrimination of religion or race.
good,"Tyson is a place you can work at and pay the bills. It’s easy to move up on production levels but not management levels, if you’re not already a manager. It’s all about how you make it there."
good,Most of the people are nice. Very good pay and benifits. Just really no time for a home life because you are always working and if your not you are sleeping.

good,"Good managament that try and take care of you"
good,"I believe that at the plant that I was working that it was a progressive working environment that felt like family and that the growth opportunity was there, but with any situation there is no perfection."
good,"I had a wonderful manager. I didn't particularly enjoy having to do inspections in the plant due to the potential for accidents/incidents. I feel that the employees should have been searched prior to entering the facility due to high incidences of work place violence.  I did not like not knowing what time I was going to get off. If a machine broke down and production was placed on hold, the nurse were expected to stay if production resumed after repairs which mean that you may have to work a 12 or 14 hour shift. You may have to work a 2 hour shift."
good,"Work Monday through Friday 8 hours a day "
good,"I would recommend anyone to work here. The pay is great as maintenance technician, the hours weren't the best but it wasn't too bad. If you don't have a family, its a great place to make a decent living."
good,"I loved this job, had to leave, loved the staff, loved the atmosphere would go to work for them again in a heartbeat. Unfortunately I want to make a little more money in the beginning but they do have opportunities to advance. Loved them."
good,Seems many corporations have their ways about them and this company is no different than others. Many days are stressful in the many departments. Management needs to be more conscious of their workers of who is doing the job and who is not.
good,"The job requires responsibility and adaptability. It is hard easy work. Dont go expecting to slack off, and always be ready to give it a good try. Safety first."
good,Great place to work but middle management can be weaK.  mANAGEMENT AT THE TOP IS GREAT AND VERY INNOVATIVE IN THING.  however.  dOES NOT TRANSlate down to middle management
good,They offer the opportunity to be rehired which gives a lot of people jobs. They also offer the opportunity to promote within the company. If you are ambitious Tyson Foods in a great place to work and advance.
good,Tyson fresh meats will give you the opportunity to make money and even advance considering who you work under. Ethics and mortality are strongly recommended .very  seldom practiced by management.
good,it was a great paying job with great benifits. the enviorment is the same as most factories you have your good and bad. the cold is something that does take some getting used to
good,The job at Tyson foods was very informative. They worked with a lot of different organizations such as peta and also other government officials. It was a place were advancement and better pay was always an option.
good,Normally if you have a problem they laugh and they blow you off until you personally force them to sit and talk to you..they try and avoid all conflicts or difficulties until they absolutely have to address the issue
good,I came into tyson at 18 years old it is a good job but they have two major issues. 1. It is so unorganized and 2. You are underpaid for the hours and labor you work.
good,Era uma empresa agradável dinâmica de ser trabalhar as pessoas sempre trataram os outros muito bem
good,Had to provide all dry goods material for the production lines.  Had to ensure all dry goods materials were ordered and kept on hand at all times and had to take into consideration the time delays with some of the material that was ordered.  Had to work closely with accounting when doing weekly inventories.
good,Went threw steps  threw out the plant processing chicken  so it could be shipped for sales.   Lots of diffrent job titles threw out the plant.    It’s not for me tho. I want something better.
good,"Great place of business, "
good,"P{aid very well, extremely cold the department I was working in was called  wing line and then I moved up to pack out both department were below 32 degrees at all times.  Good pay just felt like I needed to relocate."

good,loading meat and talking to others to work as a team to achieve the best production. it was truly a great experience working there at tyson foods company.
good,"Enjoyed working, supervisor was very friendly. On hot summers gateraid and water was always in our reach.  Rotation for our breaks to stretch our arms and walk around. People was very friendly and the food in the cafeteria was very good and healthy."
good,"I learned more about food production almost likely on the meat of pork. This is a good experience for me. All people are so kind and lovely,hardworker"
good,"It is a great place to work, the men I work with are very experienced and helpful for the most part. Maintenance management gave me the opportunity to work for them straight out of high school and I am thankful for that. I feel like I am learning very quickly. Easy place to learn and work at!"
good,The organization has undergone significant change over the last several years but is overall a good place to work. I would recommend this organization to my peers.
good,"Enjoyed working there. Didnt mind my tools constantly being stolen, lack of team work unqualified management or constantly being pushed into unsafe situations."
good,I left Tyson Foods due to advancement in my career.  My ambition was and still high to agree and continue to learn.  I was not satisfied being in a rut .
good,Maintaining professional with co workers and customers was my strength. The work place was very friendly and pleasant place to work.  Tyson allowed me to display my talent and grow while I was employed with the company.
good,I worked st Tyson for 6 months. It was a good place to work. I enjoyed my job. I would work at Tyson again if I did not have to relocate to Garden City K S
good,Tyson had its flaws just like any other job but I liked working there. I jack drove most of the time while i was there and I became one of the best jack drivers. There were days that were challenging but the pay was decent
good,"After the new CEO came in (January 2017), there was a reorg of the entire company. I worked in IT, and waited nearly a year to be able to do anything strategic related to my job. When they finally did the IT re-org, my job was eliminated. I liked the company and the work, but the constant uncertainty was unnerving (apparently rightly so)."
good,Mirco managed to the point that job responsibilities were not getting done.  There are plenty of policies and procedures to follow if you are allowed to manage to your level.  Most times you do not work in in roll due to upper management
good,lovely workplace and some decent employees.. Cold. Fun. Exciting and really show care for the employees. Tyson is tied into more than you think out here
good,but it is a steady reliable job to pay the bills even if it is strict and boering the managment could be more supportive of the team mates and see when they need help and try to help them more then just giving them the boot
good,there is much opportunity.  still somewhere I respect and would consider returning if opportunity presented itself.  some very good people work here. much respect
good,This job is something that one would really have to get use to its very fast pace with short breaks and a lot of people that really dont want to be there

good,"this is a very good company when it comes to overtime because sometimes we work 7days a week nonstop and the pay is great, also benefits and store discounts are awesome too."
good,"Cooperative and understanding with Balancing work & home. Fair, Keep the employees informed. Most difficult tasks are when carriers do not show up by apt, s times or notify of the delay."
good,"It's not a bad job, really. The only downside to my job was that my supervisor was incompetent. But most people wont have the same experience i did due to the many departments and jobs they have."
good,I like the fact you can get lots of hours and over time pay. It is fast pace most of the time and you need to work as a team in order to meet your daily goal for the line.
good,Tyson Foods is a great company to work for. Benefits are good and the culture is people-oriented. I have learned much about corporate work. The hardest part of the job is maintaining constant goals. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people.
good,i worked third shift i didn't have to many dislikes about tyson they pay excellent most of the people are nice not to smart but nice people if you have a record and you are trying to get you life back on track tyson is the place to go
good,"A little to hot but other than that very good environment,  kinda dirty for food but cleaned well when cleaned loved my job just had issues had to do jail time wish they would hire me back for another chance but now its 3 years that u haven't worked there which Is not fair"
good,working at Tyson didn't take me long to learn to work a machine pack and trim meat but the only thing i don't like is how they have favoritism and that not how you run a plant

good,lots of smart people in a fast changing environment.  great place to work.  I really enjoyed my time here and had some great bosses and great co-workers
good,"Fast paced, sometimes fun sometimes not, mostly kind people, great job if you want to hone your skills, lots of opportunity to grow if your willing to put in the work."
good,Not a job where you need a lot of knowledge. You do the same thing over and over again. They do hire within the company a lot and the benefits are great.
good,"I look forward to working for a company where I can use my skills: forklift operator, bobcat operator, Fresh-Pack, Potato storage, and general laborer."
good,"This was a great job with very good management.  They have since been bought out so my review is irrelevant. The pay was great, the hours were great, and I was able to be home every night with my family."
good,"obviously its cold bc of the freezers needed to store the food but you get use to it. some areas is warmer, a lot warmer. you are rotating every 30 mins or so. one area your rotating from cold to warm every hr or so. overall a good place to work, then.. im not sure about now."

good,I have been in poultry going on my 26th year and best part of my job is the people that I work with. The time spent with team members and working side by side with them helps get a better understanding of what it takes to get the job done safely and with quality. I have learned a lot and am ready to share all the things that I have learned to make something better.
good,Never a dull moment. Always something different. Job is challenging at times but rewarding. I enjoy the people I work with. I also enjoy helping people.
good,My experience with Tyson was ok. They always made shure there workers was safe and they always got me home on time. Just wanted to get off the road and drive local or box trucks.
good,Good people and place to work. Company has a bright future. They contribute to the community they have facilities. Great work schedule. Quality equipment that is maintained well.
good,i was a foreman in evis department. i learned everything i didn't at my last production job. management needed more training on morals. hardest part was organization in management. most enjoyable was there was a lot of room for advancement  here and fast.

good,"Tyson Foods was a fun and fast paced place to work. I enjoyed  knowing that my work meant something. There are a lot of different cultures that work at Tyson.  It was fun learning about all of them.  For the most part, the management team was awesome.  But, there are always those few that make things difficult.  The hardest part of the job was being able to stand on your feet for long periods of time.  The first couple of weeks are a little difficult, but once you are able to get past those. It is a breeze.  The best part of the job, was the health insurance.  It was not too expensive. Plus, there are many options available."

good,"My experience wit Tyson was typical for factory work. The hours were long at times but i did enjoy seeing my checks every week. I did not like the coworkers only because in a small town like that all the did was gossip and start mess. I did like the management a lot of them were down to earth a genuinely caring. The hardest part or the job of course was the standing in one spot on your feet. I was giving opportunities to learn different jobs. I learned to make marination, how to work different machines, and how to cut a whole chicken.

good,"na tyson o serviço ensina muito a trabalhar em equipe e a ser comprometido para ninguem ter que trabalhar mais que ninguem, la era muito bom pois os funcionarios e chefes conversam quando ha um problema para achar uma solução."
good,It was definitely a different experienced with me since i have always worked outside or in brand new renovated homes because of the temperature and how cold it was but definitely a good learning experienced as I became a successful forklift driver and it was my first true experience working on an assembling line of some sort.There were some workers who cared less then others which made me pick up the slack on their jobs as well but Ive learned that happens everywhere and Ive may have been the one at some point who needed someone to pick up the slack for me at one point in time. but overall it was a great experienced and disappointment in myself the way it had to end but only trust in god that he has better things to come for me.

The job provided a good deal of physical exercise, which was nice."
good,"Get there early in the morning and cut meat all day until I get off.I learned how to disassemble a cow from head to toe, how to sharpen a knife and keep it sharp. Management was very laid-back as long as you do your job to the best of your ability.

When every machine starts up good we have a great day. We all work together very well as a team. The hardest part of the job is when we have a break down, when that happens it affects a lot of people and it also affects us getting out production, because we have so many pounds of meat to get out each week. I enjoyed everything about my job except for being cold all day long, that was the only negative thing i would have to say about my job. That was the best job i ever had when i worked there."
good,"We work on a line, where we load the meat into the machine, & then we check it for contaminants. The most enjoyable part of my job is that we have a set schedule & the hardest part of the job is shoveling 1400 lbs of meat that needs to be re-processed."
good,I didn't like the people some were good some were bad. It was hard labor.
good,"Cold work days, easy work, friendly people, like the bosses, good pay at the time"
good,"The most stressful part of my day! The supervisors wanted the team mebers to do more than what their jobs were, while they let certain people take hour breaks."
good,Great place to work. Family oriented locaiton. There are great advancement opportunities.
good,Also a great company but the temperature is extremely hot....Even in the winter.
good,I dealt with chemicals. Liked to ensure that the machines were properly sanitized for the production of the chicken. I enjoyed working with mostly everyone.
good,Good Benefits. and hours.
good,"Tyson im my on words was a life filling experience and I learned alot about being a hard worker,a team member,and a good person as well as obtained some work ethics' that I will carry with me for the rest of my life."
good,I love the work I do & the satisfaction that comes with doing it well. I am very greatful to have the position I have. But overall there are major factors that have led me to believe that I should begin seeking employment else where. I'd like to find a place of employment that will provide a fair chance of advancement.
good,A typical work day is working hard and getting the job done. Meeting your goals and percentage of that day. i learned that hard work does pay off. The managment is very good and cool to work with. I have a ver great time with all mt co-workers. My co-workers are a good help. The hardest part of the job is getting through your break in pain. The most enjoyable part is all the upgrades you get. Which helps you to move up in the company.
good,I left the company rather quickly. The person that hired me was let go so I decided to follow.
good,"A typical day includes starting up and shutting down my equipment, as well as maintaining that equipment. The most enjoyable part of my job is running the ultrasound as it is a challenge to get it perfect everytime I scan. The people are also enjoyable."
good,"Pay rebates (weekly, monthly, yearly), Maintain price lists, resolve pricing discrepancies, read new account contracts and set up acruals, rebates, price lists, enter reminders in calendard when pricing expires, run volume reports, aend team meetings, track contract signature process, once fulling signed, send one copy to customer via UPS, file fully signed copy online and in file drawer."
good,At the beginning it was a grate place to work but the end Iwas very hurt on how they treated us employeers. They raise the rates so high we could not make a good living . Before I left i was bring on 104 dollars a week .
good,The 7-3:30 work schedule was structured and expectations were made clear. I learned how to expediently multi-task and work well under minimal supervision.
good,I enjoyed being around people who are all so different. I was allowed to travel to learn new things that would help me become a better Supervisor
good,"all Tyson was good to work for other than supervisor they need work on helping team members"
good,Alot of people who really isnt doing they job. Tyson foods is mainly a party plant. Second shift dont do they work so its double work on 1st shift. Its all about who you know
good,Good place to learn all aspects of mechanics. Pneumatics hydraulic and electrical. Working 6 and 7 day a week can get old. But if you like over time it's a good place.
good,A good place to work at we just dont get enough points to be as flexible but there than that the people you can trust they respect you white or green hat they help you if you dont understand and they will show you the correct way to do it right it's a great place to work other than the point system....
good,"There good. You Never stay in one station for a long period of time. So you tend to rotate , to three different jobs if you become a GPW  (general production worker). Every 15 minutes."
good,"12 hr shifts 3-4 day weeks, usually overtime available. Very ample point system. The medical they provide doesn't cover much and I'm learning maternity leave is going to be almost impossible to survive financially, so I'll have to sacrifice healing and time with my newborn for a paycheck."
good,"Time management is crucial and multitasking is important to accomplish all checks in a timely manner "
good,Dá para trabalhar tem chances de promoção  tem que mostrar interesse.
good,"This job was hard work and long days, but I enjoyed it. I only left Tyson for a job that was closer to home. Management is great and relatable. Treat you more like family than staff."
good,This is a great job for someone that only works. The interview consists of questions about your availability and preferences followed by an offsite drug test and physical screening. You have to wait about 2 weeks to a few months before being called. Once you get that call you're working the following week. The first week 3 day video training and 2 days of actual training. Once you start you work 6 days out of the week and around the holidays you work 7 days a week for weeks at a time. It is great money and is great for those that do not have family because you miss out alot on your outside life.  Pay ranges anywhere from 600-800 dollars a week getting paid weekly.with bonuses and pay increases almost every 6 months or so.
good,Would recommend working for Tyson Foods. Great people who treat you nicely. They support their community and it’s ran like a well oiled machine. Have lots of great friends still working at Tyson.
good,"If you can deal with the cold temperatures and (sometimes) hard manual labor, you’ll feel a sense of accomplishment when you bring home that paycheck! Not only that, it’s Union so job security is no issue at Tyson!"
good,Tyson Foods is an ok Job. I like the fact I’m getting paid weekly. They feed us a lot their. The management is fair. They have a good understanding on things as well.
good,It's constantly busy environment. Fast pace. Easy to learn if you really want to learn it. You're either in a hot environment or in a cold environment. Possible to have an office job as well.
good,"I started my career with Tyson Foods, Inc. straight out of college. The company offers great pay and continuously has opportunities for growth as long as you are willing to relocate. The Tyson plants operate at a minimum of 10hrs per day, 6-7 days per week. If you're salaried, you do receive weekend compensation. The higher up you are in management the more you become an ""on call"" employee. Don't expect to have a peace of mind outside of work. at 3am on a Wednesday or 12pm on a Sunday, your assistance may be required."
good,"It has been sad to see the corporate culture really decline after Donnie Smith left. He was one of those rare people who could bring out the best in others. While the company still offers decent place to work, the opportunity to move up and make a difference has become very difficult. Things have gotten way more politically motivated, and even more of a ""good ol' boys"" club. If you don't know the top dogs, you don't have any change of promotion."
good,"It's ok. It's a job. Tyson can be a sexist company especially at the monett, Mo plant. They dont like to have girls stacking off. I understand it gets heavy after a while but some girls can do it. Some people dont talk to the girls like they should. It's a lot of being demanded to do something. It's hard work. The bullying can be bad. Especially if your not already in the in crowd."
good,"Great hiring process, awesome benefit program, stock options, not much room for growth and advancement and salary could be much better considering but overall not a bad company to work for."
good,Great place to work great brand to work for. IWould enjoy my job a lot more if I lived closer I work 13 hours a day and I live an hour away. Would be a lot better if everybody had the same initiative to work instead of doing nothing but you get that everywhere
good,My job had to grow on me cause I didn't think I would of made it as long as I did working there.I'm not saying it's an easy ride. Especially when you have crooked supervisors you work under who make your job stressful and hard. Anything outside of that Tyson is an ok place to work especially if you need your bills paid.
good,"Good benefits, great people. Depending on where and what your job is, it's usually cold. It takes awhile to get used to it. Regardless of department, a lot of overtime."
good,"It was fun working under Tyson . I own the property that that rises chicken. i work on my own time.Daily activities, had the check all the temperatures from the chicken farms and make sure all the equipment are working properly,"
good,It's a good job just can't take the smell and the dirty smocks they were horrible. It made me sick to my stomach to smell something so smelly for that period of tine.
good,"I enjoyed the challenge of working with all the different utilities systems we were in charge of operating and maintaining.  However, the corporate mandatory computer interface training of all employees concerning basic skills and knowledge is more than a little overkill and very frustrating."
good,"A typical day at Tyson foods was hanging dead birds, cutting the butts out, trimming the bad parts from the birds. Checking for feathers and feet. I learned how the chicken plant operate."
good,"A company with opportunity in advancement of accountability of skill and ability to complete task.  Great benefits if your looking for them. a day of work is on different level at anytime, for you never know what can happen in my field of refrigeration. Management could be based on better terms of attitude for the job at hand sometimes, people skills should be required. hardest part of the job is dealing with those in your field that doesn't have your back in dangerous situations. One must understand this a work place of safety and accountability of awareness, Lives are at stake. Many different personalities and origins of culture, so you must be a team player without color, race, or creed boundaries. I've had great opportunities to learn a great deal with team of great co-workers, as well as bad. The most enjoyable part of the day is knowing you've returned home to your family the same way you left and no casualties on your shift. Tysons is a growing field of many nations and opportunity for a long term career, so aim high with expectations of personality and potential. They offer help in any area of life in and out of the job, time of concern with family needs as well."
good,"I enjoyed  the. Pay. And. Coworkers at Tyson foods,  the work schedule was decent , the paid holidays and vacation were also a plus. Working on holidays was easy with the extra pay plus your time and a half.   Most of management was very easy to work for ."
good,just needed to take a break was working 7 days a weekit was rough on me was defiantly not use to working it kicked my butt but it was a good job thanks
good,"I was on night shift so there was some long hours, really long. Most of the people where nice. The pay was really nice. But it was way to cold and I was always getting sick."
good,I have learned a lot of great skills over the past 12 years. A typical day could be easy going or it could be 12hrs without a break. Just in last couple years has the morale and how individuals are treated  has gone down the drain. I have total respect for management as a whole but its time for a change for me.
good,"6 days a week but the company has a great structure. Also you don't hate come to work which is a benefit wherever you work. "
good,"I love the people I worked with. Everyday is different which keeps my brain stimulated. However, the job is a bit stressful at times and the hours vary between 8-10 hours a day so people starts getting frustrated and annoyed. The work is fast pace and everything about the job is team work. Safety is always the number one concern, follow by food safety and then efficiency. I love the fact that we have safety huddles everyday before the start of each shifts. It even includes warm up exercises to get the blood flowing through our bodies before working so that we don't strain ourselves or get injured. Sure the hours are never set each day because we don't get off until the job is done, but I also appreciate the overtime pay. I had a really good experience with Tyson Foods."
good,"I enjoyed my experience at Tyson Foods, the money was good and i didn't mind the overtime too much. If you don't mind a chilly and somewhat damp environment its not a bad place to work."
good,"I currently work here and I am devoted to doing my beat on my job... But there are other that I work with that are there to socialize all day instead of work, which makes my workload much more difficult...  Managers pick and choose their favorites and treat others unfairly.  You can move up in this company pretty quickly if you desire to do so... But it very competitive and very cut throat... Tyson has great benefits but is the benefits and pay worth the stress on your mind, body, and soul???  I don’t know..."
good,Job security is hard to come by when your job can be outsource to different county-  Hardest part of the job was the daily meeting with management on process status  of the position.
good,"Tyson Foods was an okay to work I worked there for 13 years. There are some good things about Tyson such as the benefits, and there are alot of friendly people there. Sometimes they treat their employees who have been there for years unfairly."
good,I was a yardsman on the slaughter side until it closed down. I actually enjoyed my job although it was dangerous at times. I got along well w/ all my coworkers and we worked great together. I wouldnt mind still working there.
good,Tyson is going through lots of changes. It has done a great job changing with the culture. But there is still a LOT of work to do in the area of people management and talent mapping.
good,Besides it being a chicken plant it’s not bad it doesn’t stink it’s not messy the only thing that was bad is no one speaks English it’s fast paced and very very cold
good,Over all it was a good job i was having problems with the heavy lifting of 30 to 40 pound boxes the work place and the people were easy to work for i liked.the hours of second shift the problem fof working for them was the heavy lifting and the problem of being able to move to a differnt location in dark meat or to a new department
good,It’s ok the drive is just to far if it wasn’t to far I wud have stayed the environment was good I loved getting paid every week they do take pride in their employees and try to accommodate us as much as possible
good,"I learn a lot about safety of employees than any other places I worked for. good management, working an a maintenance  mechanic was  very enjoyable for me"
good,Awsome. i loved it. always kept me busy. and i can do almost everything in the plant. i have quite aloty of experience in tyson foods chicken plant...
good,"I really enjoyed my time at Tyson, but they are not very competitive for salaries in my field of expertise. There was very little chance of advancement in my position."
good,"I loved my job because I got paid weekly and the pay was worth it , also it helped pay my bills on time while I was there. I would love to go back to tyson."
good,"Tyson is a long established company with operations around the world as well as locally.  The company supports their communities in which they operate,"
good,Tyson foods could be a great place to work but to many people wanting to be better but don't know anything like most yellow hats and green hats the blue hats run the place
good,"Overall its a ok place to work..Some areas in the place are colder than others. Benefits after your probation period is excellent. You are standing on your feet for at least 8-10hrs a day. Fast paced enviroment, but can improve as long as you are there."
good,"Great work culture and probably the best managed poultry company in the business.  We try to engage with Team Members and offer them activities that make us the employer of choice for the area. However,low pay for hourly Team Members."
good,It was a good place to work with very friendly people. You can go to the bathrooms as many times as you'd like but don't take advantage of it. Don't talk a lot about your personal life.
good,It would be a good working place if everybody work together...and start helping like they supposed to help them and show people how the job supposed to go I think it would be a lot better for people to work there.
good,I liked my job. I liked my bosses and co-workers and i worked hard to help things run smoothly. I will likely work there again if i ever find myself in the area of another Tyson's and seeking a job. However a lead position was as high up as i was likely to ever get and they seemed to catch what rolled down hill. I enjoyed working hard and having a smooth day. I learned how to find my stride and enjoy my job and work with others because working together works the best.
good,Tyson Foods Incorporated is a good and stable place to work as long as you show up on time and ready for work. They give good benefits and bonus's to.
good,Great group of managers working hard to make quality product;  Long hours and high stress environment. Centrally managed by corporate office no ability to implement programs at plant level
good,muy buen trabajo pero con sueldos muy malos muy exigentes
good,Started as a box loader and advanced to forklift operator quickly with regular pay raises the longer I worked for the company. Had many benefits through the company that helped myself and family in times when needed.
good,Faced paced long hours. You have to be committed which I am. I just would like to advance and be on days with my family. You will be working at least over 50 hours per week.
good,"Cold environment, easy advancing, decent pay and benefits..and 40hrs work weeks, with overtime available..many departments to cross train to...felony friendly....good core values and promotes safety practices"
good,Ambiente para aumento do conhecimento profissional rápido
good,"management was not all that great , no communication , bosses chose favorites , never listened to employees needs or concerns , although pay was good and benefits ."
good,"Expect a full 8 hour + day. Work can be demanding but rewarding. Senior management on the poultry, pork and fresh meats side of business is the best in the industry. Wealth of knowledge and experience. Relaxed culture, but you must know your business wherever you work or you will be taken to task."
good,It was a fast pace workplace people where nice just need better manager. I liked the hours and benefits of they will hire me again I would work there in a heartbeat..
good,"The company's CEO had a lot of great ideas.  However, the ideas were implemented at the wrong time. I met many wonderful people and enjoyed the work, despite the stressful workload.  The management provided many comforts, e.g. unlimited beverages, fruit, work-at-home, etc. to  ease the stress of the extreme workload."
good,Very good pay rate and long hours. Very fast paced environment and hard work. Excellent medical coverage. Employees receive bonuses based upon work quality.
good,Tyson food is an OK place to work. when you work for Tyson its basically your life depending on what shift you work and what department you work in. The work isn't hard but it is fast paced.
good,It's hard to advance due to nepotism. I have seen first hand that hard work and dedication is trumped by family when it comes to advancement.  Keep your expectations low and you will work out just fine.
good,Tyson Foods is overall a pretty good place to work. First shift tends to be a tad more stressful and more competitive than the rest of the shifts. There are a lot of Management moves that are questionable and some supervisors can be harder to work with than others.
good,Great pay and benefits. Made a lot of friends and worked a lot of hours. Very good union and team. Great company picnics to world's of fun or Omaha ZOO. They were like my second family.
good,"Started out as a challenging position but diminished as time went by. I took on other responsibilities to increase the challenges, became certified to train team members in PIT and Lifts.  I"
good,Love working with there. Some management decisions could be better. I pack deli meat daily. I've learnt the machine I operate quickly and efficiently. There is a huge variety of different cultures there. Glad to be a part of that team.
good,I gained lots of experience in a new environment.  Opportunities for growth and affordable insurance for the whole family.  Very clean and organized facility.  Lots of opportunities for growth with the company.
good,The job was fast paced but it was not conducted profesionally. I had some safty concerns with the way that the transportation was dealt with. It was very stressful and fast paced. I did like the job but had conflicts with management
good,"Depending on your job can be stressful, management is pretty supportive. Environment can be tough to work in. Salary could be more, other factories beat what they offer."
good,Tyson Foods give me an opportunity to better myself and the work I did for wasn't easy but I did it. It was very cold in there and I learned a lot about chicken.
good,"organize and sort through paper work for all production areas, release good product, place product on hold that has deficiencies, relay quality issues to manger and supervisor, run and send reports, file and print required paper for FSQA tech's, approve incoming spices, verify product in plant view."
good,I had a good job in tub room washing tub's and lids. keep ceiling dry had insurance. a typical day at work was sometimes boring and depressing.how much can I say about a chicken plant.the hardest part of the jobis I had to work there because I could not find work anywhere else.the most enjoyable part was finally getting to leave.
good,"I enjoyed working here.  I didn't like the point system for new hires.  My advice to any new hires, don't get sick or have any problems that might cause you to miss days.  I know that's impossible to stop or control but i was saying that to say you only get 4 points until your terminated.  No matter what the situation is."
good,"I mostly liked the pay. The people was fun too. I liked being able to meet new people. Some jobs are better than others, you'll be able to move up in the company fast. I just wish I had worked there longer."
good,The management and supervisors are not that bad. I work that for four years. I ended up with pain and fluid in my knees from standing in one place for 12 hours a day.
good,"A typical day at work as maintenance was very boring. I would change over the line for different cuts when necessary. assist with film changes and co2 changes for the bagger. other than that I would just walk around the cut up room evaluating equipment. the hardest part of the job was dealing with production supervisors that would go out of their way to humiliate you and say things over the radio like ""can we get a REAL maintenance man over here!"". as a line lead it was stressful because sometimes equipment breaks down and you have a lot of orders to fill and you don't want to have to short an order because that looks bad on the company and yourself. and you had to deal with people that try to make things harder than they have to be."
good,I liked this job because I got to learn how to document important information for the company while also getting involved and helping with the duties in the plant.
good,Not a bad company to work for with good wage compensation.  The work place culture is enjoying for the most part and fosters a team concept.  The company is very training and safety oriented.
good,Nice environment to work real friendly employees the rate of pay in the maintenance department was wonderful had most weekends off to spend time with family. Overall I would recommend this company.
good,"I enjoyed the work it added a new definition to my wexperience. I underwent training in Atlanta,GA to llearn operation of complex operation of Koch machine.I ran end , edge and vertical  boring machines. And practiced quality control of products coming down the line. And operated the forklift."
good,"Tyson's Food was a pretty decent workplace to most, though it had it's days were it could be tough. Though I do believe it the pay was higher back then, those days wouldn't hadn't been as rough. I would definitely recommend someone that can tolerate being around the processing of meat or the odor of a dying animal."
good,I have learned a lot working at Tyson foods I have honed my skill set and open my mind on how to work on various types of machinery and electrical devises
good,"Issues related to management at times, but overall okay.  Worked at the company for a long period of time, so job stability is okay and ability to advance to a higher position is okay."
good,A typical day at work was when I was able to receive a better job for the plant which was a HACCP Tech job. I learn the different temps of the food whether it was good or bad. Correction had to be implemented before starting back up. I was supported by many co-worker who was willing to help me along the way. The hardest part of this job was to stay business because it did not require a lot of time. The most enjoyable part of this job was being able to be flexible and interact with supervisors.
good,It is a good place to work and you will learn a lot depending on your job dept. and your will to learn. The number of  diverse people from all over the world help yu understand the different cultures.
good,"Everybody is busy all the time. Everybody takes care of what he has to do. Everyday the company provides over 5500 cows. The employment office still hires new people. Some time the visitors come to the floor to watch how the job is going on. Anytime all co.workers switch from position to position. sometimes some workers play , joke and share some news."
good,a typical day at Tyson is to go in and people be pushing saying ugly words to get their PP and you get on the line and they you may work on the line or they may put you somewhere different if they're shorthanded the.management is a joke they either try to hide and stay out of the production area or they just stand around and look dumb all day
good,"Gestionar las necesidades de los clientes."
good,"For the Daily work in my Experience as first timer to work as a labor got me the big challenge and meet all kinds of skilled and none skilled workers and I learn the hardest job I ever had but I enjoy it."
good,"Having meetings with manager, also fun to work with"
good,"I fixed machines, general maintenance and repair, and I had to troubleshoot problems and solve them. My co-workers were hard working and did not get attitudes with each other.  In honesty, I did not enjoy wallowing in fat and guts a lot, but I enjoyed troubleshooting and solving problems.  I enjoy fixing things."
good,"Great company to work for, only concern is the stability of the company given the many aquistions. Things may get better now that Tyson has aquired the company."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is the fact that you meet different people and you learn a lot about the foods you eat everyday.
good,I gained a lot of entry-level skills with this position immediately upon graduation. There are a lot of resource groups to engage to build your network if you wish to climb the corporate ladder.
good,"Tyson overall is a good place to work to provide for your family. The thing I don't like about is that some of the people don't have respect for one another and it gets out of hand sometimes. I have been there for a long time and I have grown out of love and passion for my job because of the atmosphere. The hardest pat of the job is getting started in the mornings praying that everything is working so we can start up on time. The most enjoyable thing that I like is bagging up a product that I know I helped produce for someone around the world that ha s a smile on their face ,enjoying something good by Tyson Foods."
good,Lots of room for advancement if you are willingly to move your family and travel. Great culture amongst the upper level managers.
good,"A simple pulling job. We unload the trucks that bring the bread, after unloading, we organize the bread in order to make things easy on us to find the item or unit. Once everything has been pulled, we set all the orders out in another room for the delivery drivers to pick up. During the time the drivers are there, we help out the drivers with any question and also start to clean up the warehouse so we can be ready for the next day."
good,The hours are crazy you never know if your going to get 40 hours or not. There are times where you work 20 hours a week and then the next your working 48 hours. there is favoritism with the supervisors and if your not in their click then you get ignored.  The benefits are decent.
good,I did lots of different tasks in a day. I kept the inventory as accurate as possible considering the other shift workers and I placed the order for the parts needed. I was a very dedicated worker and very dependable. I got along with all the other employees and helped out when needed. I was given many good evaluations. The hardest part was losing my job after being told by my immediate supervisors that I was not in any way going to get cut.
good,"You stand on a line all day doing the same thing all day long. I have learnt that in a production job if one person or department is slacking or behind, it effects the whole plant. Management amongst Tyson is very experienced and skilled people who take their jobs very serious. The hardest part of my job is getting used to standing in the same spot all day, doing the same repetitive movements without a break."
good,"They look for hard workers who like to work long hours."
good,"A typical day of work as a manager consist of nine to twelve hours per day. I generally enjoy the people I get to work with, they are my second family. Some of the work involves a large amount of stress management."
good,A fine company to work for.  Good organizational culture..  Fantastic benefits.  Tuition reimbursment
good,"work was great. A little repetitive, but if you like to advance and have people skills, you'll fit right in. Work is not as hard as other production companies, but it does get hot in the summer."
good,"great place to work with great team member I worked with, day went by fast with everyone working together as a team to get the job done correctly!"
good,I had very nice managers and everything was pretty good. I just worked way too long of shifts. The kind of work I did was very hard on my body.
good,the ones you work with are good people teamwork. Grooming management and learm=ning alot
good,Tyson is not a bad place to work just dont expect to get alot of off time with family. You will have plenty of room for advancement if you have the motivation and a chance to make great money. Some  of the managment team members seem to have a problem with egos with makes it difficult in the end to get a job done effectively. As a supervisor you always have people out to get you for any reason so they can move up. Positions that are deemed the best by managers you will have a constant stream of issues thrown at you by people wanting your job. The work load may be a bit unrealistic at times but in the end it will help you learn to multitask and how much you physically can do. Tyson will not hesitate to sink money into there management team members and will let you learn and grow as much as you can.
good,Working at tysons foods was one of the best jobs i had ever had really enjoyed my job and work area the hardest part of my job was making sure our physical count of the inventory was correct in oder to get that count i would have to go out to the coolers and production floor and do a very extensive count
good,Company expansion led to many employees discarded. Typical over expansion of territories. Great benefits and compensation for employees.
good,"This was my first long time job and I learned a lot, the hardest part of the job where the inventories because it was inside the freezer a took long time."
good,A typical day at work means wearing lots of layers because it is the very cold in the plant. The early/long hours coupled with some weekend work make it hard to have a social life.
good,"stock, place orders, receive orders, handle customers, working in the cold(the freezer) is the worst part of the job"
good,a typical day at tyson was long work days and great job.i learned what a long day of work was management was not so bad and co-workers was okay and the hardest part was not geting too go to the bath room when you need too.
good,"9 to 12 hr shifts changes by the week. lots of good people, you can learn alot about the food industry."
good,Tyson Foods is a fundementaly good company that let all of IT go as a matter of practice. I do not know much else about the organization.
good,"Great place to work! The hardest part of the job was the co-worker not paying attention some time while the operator thats driving forklift has to watch employees walking in front of the forklift, Must have attention to details"
good,"working on production line most of the time under very cold conditions. I did learn a few new things in this area of work. Management was out of control. Some of the co-workers were bias, and prejudice. The hardest part of this job was working in very cold climate year round. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to learn and advance"
good,I can pay 3000 people every week and pay for lots of different types of cattle
good,"All of the co-workers were really hard working were never late, and we all worked together when we had a busy day."
good,Good place to work overall. A little behind the eight ball as far as technology.
good,This has potental to be a great place to work. they have many locations in the southern region.
good,Being at Sara Lee Bakery for nearly tens years was a great experience. I done it all from production to working on the line we made great product we just don't know exactly what caused the lay off shortly after it shut down.
good,Company has a lot of great perks! Friendly people and people take pride in their jobs.
good,"Pros: Good pay and benefits. Paid weekly. Guaranteed good hours. "
good,"Some teams are more fun than others, but Tyson is pretty good about encouraging team bonding like happy hours and free lunches, etc. Interns have good support and mentoring."
good,I enjoyed my stay. This company gives you the opportunity that most companies never will. I was happy with all the hard work and dedication I put into this company.
good,very fun and interesting place to work I learned a lot of things working there I enjoyed the company and my fellow coworkers everyone was helpful and the pay was nice.
good,I really enjoyed working here. The pay was great and I liked the department I was in. I loved the benefits they offered me especially the medicaid and dental insurance.
good,"that was very hardworking place I have ever work your energy is gonna be down because of hot and speed you know its meat with machine"
good,High fast pace team. Good culture with good people. I worked 45 to  55 hours a week. They do offer summer hours. Team members can work from home when needed.
good,"Just work hard,be safe,respectful,honest and open, helpful,stay moving,learn something new daily,go with the flow of your environment,fearless, focused, pay attention to detail"
good,"Work at Tyson was not as bad as people made it seem. Yes it does have its ups and downs. While working at Tyson I met some people who became family. I have no regrets working at Tyson,"
good,"I enjoyed working there. Good money, good friends. (there's alot of gossip, though...kind of like high school lol) only big problem i had was getting hit on alot. i have ptsd from trauma as a child and i quit when this guy felt me up in the locker room. nobody else was around and they do not have cameras in there so i felt vulnerable and scared because he wouldnt quit so when i got the chance i ran away and never went back. they called to find out why i left and i told them everything so maybe they have found a way to prevent that from happening to anyone else."
good,"This company is amazing to work for, and it is a really fun job not many people expect. However, it is a bit repetitive and you go through the motions when you are at work every day. They make it a fun workplace and treat employees wonderfully."
good,If you dont mind work o. your feet and the long hours and the physical demand it takes then this is perfect for you. It is great to job placement. And you can advance.
good,There was never a down time in Tyson. The work was always coming. During the time of work you really didn’t get days off. Management was always there anytime you needed them.
good,It is a all around great place of employment. If you make it thru your probationary period they offer excellent benefits and pay increases. The way they treat their employees is second to none.
good,Wish management was a little more concerned with daily tasks and teamwork. Other than that everything this else was prettt great I had no other problems or concerns.
good,"I liked working here because I just went to work, did my shift and went home. They also had a good pay rate. At times I often felt like management didn’t care as much needed be about the workers as they did the product and meeting their goals."
good,The compensation is not bad at Tyson the pay is ok for what is done. The current quality supervisor needs to be improved really rude and manipulating. Advancement in this company is not really easy and you have to be a favorite in order to move up.
good,They have good management might not have work for truck drivers everyday so would find something in plant for you to do. Pay was decent. if you wanna work hard and get paid for it then here is definitely the place
good,"Very easy work, all preventative maintenance that you are scheduled come with step by step instructions on how to do the job which is very useful and makes learning the job very simple."
good,Not too much of a bad place to work. You just have to be very strong minded here cause they will talk to you any kind of way they have No respect at all. But over all it’s Not too bad
good,it is a good place to work. They pay and benefits are good for the area that I am located in. Depending on gthe job and the shift a person works it can be hard to balance work and family life because some jobs requires lots of overtime. Tyson also have a excellent education assistant program for employees and scholarships for employees children.
good,"packing and shipping, cleaning, sanitation and over night work. scanning and making sure the correct shipment went to the correct truck. multi tasking with different jobs working fork manual fork lift."
good,"In my experience, my role and the ones around me were very limited. There was little room for ideas or changes. The culture of the company was great and everyone was friendly, it was just my manager that didn't know how to manage her team."
good,Good place to work for secure job. Great benefits that help when you are sick. Overall great company to work for if you can get your foot in the door.
good,Very multi-cultural causing communication issues at times. The were walls put between departments causing a lack of communication. Corporate office was very accessable and helpful.
good,Tyson is a very exciting place to work. Whether you start off small or big there is always a chance to move up in the industry. It is a very safe environment as long as you follow the rules and pay attention to the job at task.
good,"Very quick paced, a lot of tension and stress. Non stop going and supervisors were always on us. Hand eye coordination and smarts are key to success for sure."
good,I feel like the shif teaders need to show their employees more respect and show more appreciation.. Supervisors treat the lower emoyees like they arent important
good,Tyson's management was good. They made sure everyone was working and okay with there position. Working at Tyson you will have to know how to handle very low temperatures.
good,"Tyson offers many different jobs, from production to warehouse to truck driver to computer tech all the way up to VIP/Director.  If you are looking for a job chances are that Tyson has it available."
good,It was simple I learn in 2 weeks..! It was a good experience im tryna go back. It’s a good job you get paid every week so i like it a good job to have.
good,I enjoyed going in and working with knowing I knew my job and they could depend on me knowing different jobs and departments. The benefits was great which is a major reason why people work for the long periods of time.
good,Working at Tysons was hard and cold temperatures. It was made clear upon hire mostly. Great benefits though. Discounts on chicken.  Pay low for jobs. But overtime after three months and if qualified transfer to another position.  I would not recommend unless no other chose
good,Very fast paced environment but fun to work at.  Long hours a day take away from family time however.  Overall a very good place to work with advancement opportunities.
good,"It's a great career for anyone try to make an career in Tyson's food industry, an have great comp an insurance benefit's, I approve an highly approve of tyson"
good,"They do offer amazing benefits such as paid maternity and paternity leave, paid vacation and sick time, partial childcare and tuition reimbursement, medical, dental, vision, 401k and life insurance."
good,Nice equal opportunity company to work for. Most supervisors are fair. Team members work together. They have great benefits. Plenty of entry level jobs.
good,"Runs 24 hours, very cold facility, proper equipment given for warmth. management has picks and chooses who they wanna cross train. managers tell lies and very secretive about whats happening on the job."
good,"Never a dull moment, but management always seems to try and help get through the rough spots. There is always something to do and coworkers are awesome!"
good,"While working at Tyson I learn many skills. "
good,"I worked in the IQF part of a chicken processing plant. It was a hard place to work for me personally, due to the fact that it was cold and wet.The fringes were good though, as we had company-matched 401K, where it paid for me to invest in myself."
good,A typical day at work would be waiting for other co-workers to sanitize the equipment. What I learned is that you have to pay attention and keep up with others. It's very easy to get hurt when using knives at work place. The people who are managers aren't good leaders. Most of them don't have positive attitudes and motivate or congratulate when good work is being done. The hardest part about the job is listening to managers who are disrespectful to their co-workers. The most enjoyable part about the job is working others with different types of back ground.
good,"Un buen equipo de trabajo , un trabajo seguro todo el año"
good,Make good money but management is very unprofessional and they also play favoritism instead of following the procedures and guidelines to hire workers who apply for internal.
good,Management can be great at times but pretty cutthroat at times. It's an overall great place to work. Friendly work environment. Learned a variety of skills that can be useful in the future.
good,fast pace work environment. friendly workers and the equipment is always up to date. Constant getting on off lift to pick or stack up boxes. from 5 ibs boxes to 70 ibs boxs
good,Its a great place just get wet but u learn things the workers are great.Learn how to clean production machines. Learn how to use chemicals the right way its a great place to learn from can also go into stock with the company.
good,Great job and fun people to work breaks are short some times but it is a good paying job the hard work pays off food quality is good also work is very easy
good,It is not an easy job but it is a good place to work. You can get as much overtime as you need. Working on 3rd shift is a quiet but yet busy time because there is so much that has to be done before startup on 1st shift the next day.
good,I enjoyed my time being a worker for Tyson Foods. My management put the workers first and made sure that we worked efficiently and collaborative. My co-workers had positive energy and great work ethics that I learned from.
good,I have enjoyed my tine at Tyson Food. But there was no where for me to advance into a position where I could make the money l desired. Tyson has an outstanding insurance packet.
good,"Great energy and atmosphere at tyson foods. I enjoyed my time at this employer and would consider it as a work place again. very friendly, happy, smelly work place."
good,Tyson is a wonderful place to work for the long haul. The only draw back is that advancement is slow or non existing. Tyson has greate benefits! Overall a wonderful company to work for.
good,"a lot of fast pace , some days it can be like chasing your tail trying to keep up with maintenance, most days it was pretty decent........................................................"
good,very fast-paced and team oriented. able to advance quickly and obtain a leadership role. a good team is respect and ideas are shared to become better and have less downtime.
good,Tyson is a good place to work. The work/life balance is good. Management tends to dis-jointed and at times non-existent and out of touch with employees. Good place to wok though.
good,Lots of hours. Great Union Job. High pay lots of Benefits. 401k. Cheap but comprehensive health insurance. Dental Insurance. Union protection...Job security.
good,I really enjoyed working there it gave me the chance to learn a new an exciting job. The atmosphere on the floor most of the time was really good. The hardest part of the job was finally getting to interchange on other jobs.
good,"The way I see it, Tyson is not unlike any other job as far as the job is concerned. You come to work, clock in, do your job, clock out, and go wherever. The problem is people. If you go to work, mind your business, and do what they pay you to do, 9/10 times you'll be fine. But there are a lot of people that will not be willing to let it be that easy, so you will have to make some decisions."
good,"It felt like a very high responsibility, not only because I was dealing with food. So I took my job very serious and did the best I could. I believe I did what I was supposed to do but but management was poor  and progression was awful."
good,"Typical work days included making requests from field sales a priority. Learned SAP, SDS and a variety of other smaller systems. Direct managers are excellent.  Hardest part of the job is the constant change in procedures. Most enjoyable  part of the job is the regular change which prevents boredom and the ability to work with sales directly."
good,A typical work day was somewhat stressful yet enjoyed doing the work.  Most of my co-workers were so deeply imbedded in their daily routines.  There was not a lot of inner office politics.  Most people stayed to themselves most of the time.  They were very generous when it came to holidays and celebrations.
good,Tysons pays very good and the benefits are great also but the management is not that great. the work hours also are great and keep you very busy all the time
good,It was a good place to work but the company closed the plant and laid off 1200 employees.  The plant had great tenure and I miss some of the great people I worked with.
good,"Tyson Foods is a good place to work. Good pay, friendly people and generally a helpful and team oriented environment. Like any place of employment it is what you make it."
good,"this is the company that make food. we were there to prepare and put the meat in the boxes. and sent to the next  person. until the day I moved from there, I was happy of this job."
good,"Tyson was a very job job with great benefits, management was a bit terrible with the way they handled the employees but otherwise Tyson foods is a good job!"
good,I enjoy working at tyson. I want to work maintenance there. The supervision needs to focus more on safety and quality over production numbers. Ive learned several saws and have gained knowledge if the industry while working with others
good,"Good place, laid back. At first it was really difficult to not struggle with the transition into the maintenance department. However, after a week or two or three weeks even, things went swimmingly. The people that are there in the maintenance department that I worked with were absolutely great. I still work here and I don't intend to leave anytime soon. The pay is the only thing that needs some help and you're only allowed 40 hours per week Max."
good,The fast paced environment in any department at Tyson will break a non strong minded person down. Management in Material Handling are good on A and B shift But lacks qualities on C shift. Benefits are great and pay as well if you are strong minded and a hard worker that dont mind a difficult task then  you will love it as i did...
good,"Great place to work"
good,Tyson Foods is a great company to work for. A typical day is variable depending on team member attendance. I've learned and experienced lots of things.
good,"The work was simple to do. Had to wear PPE. Very Cold, if you dnt like to be cold, might not be the job for you. Will be able to buy tyson products at a discount price."
good,"The company is effecient with its handleing of product and ensuring that it gets checked and ensured that it is high quality consumable product. "
good,"Repetitive, not to bad when you learn the job, lots of friendly people. Hot and cold side. 8 hours a day and sometimes 6 days a week. People work together to create a better environment, and there's safety there which I liked."
good,well paying but has way to may policies and isnt really there for the individual worker but as long as you mind your own business and dont talk to managment they are a good company to work for
good,"I like working there but i want to move in different direction. it's a good place to work and make more money, I will as well recommend this job to other friends."
good,Very relaxed work environment. Other employees where very nice and friendly. Comfortable going to managers to ask questions.  Always something to do. learn something new everyday.
good,"Enjoy enthusiastic team members in a getting days work completed. Things I learned on shipping/ receiving not only to build orders, but to create orders for team members can build them. In addition, schedule trucks for pickup and deliver to various locations."
good,"I liked the job. They changed from an all over US schedule to a regional schedule couldn't make the money I needed. Nothing bad to say about the company,"
good,It was a great experience to work there and it taught me a lot and if I had to go back I actually would because I learned a lot while working there and got complimented on being a great worker all the time.
good,Good place to work never have any problems. People are very nice and like to joke around and make the day of work go by but gets serious when needed..
good,"I worked in a fast paced environment where my daily tasks were always changed. No day was the same twice. I enjoy food safety and over-looking production to see that product is produced in a safe environment. However, when you work for a major corporation sometimes it's difficult to remain true to who you are without feeling like you are questioning all your decisions."
good,"I work for the Tyson Foods Corporation, increasing daily food production by 15,000 lbs; improving efficiency of all poultry products., for seven years. Upon unfair termination I was descriminated against denied unemployment benefits. resulting cause loss of family home and a relocation, bankruptcy was the ending result....."
good,This job was great when it began but as soon as they stared to do lay offs no one was safe. It changed the whole company dynamic the freedom and security was no longer there. Immediate management was great the whole department was truly a family. Sad to have left.
good,"for me a typical day at work was to serve the customers with products they order to be on time with delivery, meeting new people as you serve them getting to know them better and what they expect of your services"
good,I've been with Tyson foods going on 20 years and I wouldn't change any of my years. I moved around to different states trying other fields. Tyson gave me a chance to learn and grow as much as I can the job you wanted was up to you if you wanted to move up.
good,The shift starts with a routine stretch. You learn patience and persistency. The management is pretty well-round. Co-workers are enjoyable. There wasn't anything hard about the job.
good,"The days was simple work days to me. I learned that I good at multiple things. The management was simple,because I had too many bills. I wasn't there to mingle but they were cool. Can't really say things were hard. The enjoyable part was my bills were paid, and I had extra cash."
good,"great paying job but days off are hard to come by."
good,"It's consistent work, pretty easy stations, advancement is quick, you can choose out of 3 shifts. Management is helpful if there are any issues. They do fun activities for holidays or trying to raise money for causes."
good,"Fast paced work environment, with high upper management demands. Long hours, hardest part of job is working second shift, and having to finish whatever first shift doesn't."
good,"Enjoyed working there, people there were always busy working and the managers there did not play which was understandable. Everything there was cleaned and organized."
good,"•	Develop and Execute production Schedule based on business demand and capacity."
good,"A Typical Day at work consists of set up of machines, conveyor belts, and Scales Maintaining equipment upkeep. I have Learned to Communicate well with Production workers, Production Supervision, and Upper Management. Hardest part of my job was trying to answer multiple service calls at once..Most enjoyable part of my job was Working weekends rebuilding and installing new Equipment."
good,"A typical day started at 1:45 pm. After suiting up with your personal proctective gear, you will go to your station and start working the orders. I would do QA every hour to check the product coming off the line. My supervisor was a wonderful person always there to help you with anything that came up. My co-workers were as if they were family we all covered each other. The hardest part of the job was when we were told they were closing the plant. I could not have asked for a greater group of people to work with."
good,The company as a whole is good to work for. The small plant I work for it is hard to advance. You are kind of stuck in your position.
good,"I had enjoyed working for company, I had learned a lot  while I was there made a lot of friends while their most all company practice very good safety rules."
good,"A typical day at worked involved isolation from other members. I learned very little valuable/ real world lessons while working there, but I was taught to do a specific task. The management was not great, but overall were very good at what they do. I know very little about my co-workers, because my job did not include interaction with many people while working. The hardest part of the job was having to run the Embrex machine when certain workers would call in sick. The most enjoyable part of the job was the accomplished feeling after I had finished cleaning/ repairing a machine."
good,I learned a lot about industrial electrical and mechanical operations. I had a lot of great supervisors that i worked underneath. The hardest part of the job was understanding all the different languages. There are so many different cultures that work at tyson.
good,Great to work for if you are going to college and starting to find jobs. Easy to work for and they work with you around your college classes.
good,Was a great place to work to get my feet wet while also being a full time college student. Manger worked around me college classes to still get some hours in even after classes and when finals came up she cut back a few hours so i could study and prepare for finals.
good,I enjoyed my time there i learned some skills and gained good person skills. It also showed me the different type of way the chicken can be shipped and kept..
good,"The facility where I work has only been owned by Tyson for about 9 months, so I do not have a considrable amount of knowledge about Tyson to share.  Overall, I feel they are a good company to work for."
good,"I have worked at Tyson for about 2 years and i feel that it is my time to move on to another employer. I spend most of the time in the freezer department due to a number of flaws in the inventory system. Due to the number of variables in the work place, you will be required to change job duties and that affects your salary."
good,"A typical day at work, consist of loading product on truck and selling product.. keeping shrink down to a minimum.management was good.. good company to work for untill got bought out.."
good,"I believe my favorite part of this position were the benefits provided. Not only did I have great insurance but my whole family was included as well, for free. The work was fast paced and continuous which was also great."
good,Recently acquired by Tyson foods. No comment.  I can't comment because I'm not familiar with the new management.  Old Hillshire Rocked!
good,working for Tyson was a learning experience that showed me that a person with a little motivation and knowledge can move within the company and do quite well.
good,I enjoyed my time working at Tyson.  Met a lot of very nice people.  I liked driving a forklift when I worked in maintenance.  Thought I was treated unfairly when my employment was ended.  I learned to watch your back
good,"some of the mangment was ok, pretty hot place to work in summer,insurance was a far price, overall pretty clean place,cleaning crews did there best to keep up"
good,"I worked with some of the smartest and best people you could hope to work with at Tyson foods. "
good,"A typical day consisted of showing up on time for your shift and hitting the floor. I learned a variety of things, from running machine and simple tasks such as hanging hot dogs and pushing carts. The management is easy going as long as you're performing your work duties. The employees there are easy to get along with and create a fun working environment. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing when you're done you get to leave, most of the tasks there are simple to perform."
good,"Hands on experience in a field of nursing that you cannot get in nursing school."
good,I worked for this company for 4 years and at the end of the day wasn't satisfied with management
good,A typical day at work at Tyson foods will be me getting to work early to insure the knifes and sharpeners work probably before the shift starts and insure that My co-workers was comfortable with there mats they stand on.
good,"Overall, the company is pretty good to compensate for work done."
good,My day usually go well but sometimes can get real busy...It can get multi tasking but i enjoy doing my job. Its nothing hard about doing my job you just have to competitive and consistent and dedicated.
good,Enjoyed working at Hillshire but they were in the process of making changes and needed to do a better job of adjusting.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of safely producing a quality product in volume.  I have learned to be a diverse Manager over the years, simply because it works for me. I enjoyed the constant push to put more volume out per  upper management.  The Hardest part of my job was terminating a hard working employee for attendance reasons; although, holding employees accountable was part of my job description.  The most enjoyable part of the job is setting a goal and achieving it as a  team."
good,I enjoyed working at Tyson just didn't like the commute to work.
good,Worked 8-12hrs 7 days a week which was the hardest part of the job and its been very cold and wet. But the pay was resonable and they gave bonus. I've learned to be more dependable and worked as a team as well i learned all the safety tips.
good,"My day started at 5:15pm and ended at 2:00 or3:00am everyday and itwas long and fast."
good,Day to day doesn't change much but I really enjoyed the people I worked with
good,"To hand pick and load chickens in cages all day in the hot heat and cold conditions. Had to learn to adapt fast,management fair co-workers had each others back,Everything about that job was difficult. Going home and getting my check was most liked."
good,"I learned a lot working as an occupational health nurse, I grew as a person, and learned how to  multitask, and organizational skills. I also took responsibility for work compensation, and inventory to all nursing departments."
good,El ambiente de trabajo es bueno solo que a veces se pone un poco pesado pero yo creo que depende de cada persona como tomar y manejar las situaciones. Aprendí que formando un buen equipo de trabajo se pueden lograr muchas cosas buenas. Personas que ocupan puestos de gerencia son muy amables con sus subordinados y te dan la confianza de poder ir con ellos y platicar de las inconformidades. Mis compañeros son de las personas que te brindan apoyo laboral y personal. lo mas difícil del trabajo es el tiempo ya que hay actividades que llevan mas de tiempo en realizarse pero por eso hay compañerismo. Lo que me gusta mas del trabajo es el ambiente en el que se elabora ya que uno recibe ayuda de los demás y también unas de las cosas que mas me gustan son los retos que hay día con día.
good,I love that you work long shifts an the labor not only helps with the job it helps with yourself also.
good,I had an easy job with this company but I had to relocate. I feel that it is a good starter job but not a long term job for someone with ambition.
good,It's a job. Great company friendly environment to work in. Different cultures. Strict supervisors and managers when it comes down to production consistency running. I'm okay with working fast it keeps the time moving and management happy.
good,Great place with great people had with a good environment to meet good people and have lots of fun
good,"This is an organization that believes in giving back to the employees. The pay scale is not top of the line, but does make up with benefits."
good,"I enjoyed the people I worked with and the personal friends I made in my short time there, but honestly due to the sanitation and the way management treats you, I would not want to work there again."
good,keep the line running no set backs. roll parts and keep clean.
good,"Chicken production, messy work, great co-works, made a few friends."
good,"A typical day at work: Walk in through the gate showing ID badge.  Trade in chip to get work rob.  At 4pm, clock in.  Go to designated area to put on PPE which included hair bonnet, eye protection, cotten gloves, rubber gloves, shoe bonnets, ear plugs and plastic aprons.  At 4:15 pm, I had to be at my work station ready to work.  First shift employees would be leaving so that we could get up on the cat walk which was a shelves similar to milk crates.  As the whole bird chicken started coming from the cooler, I would have to grab a bird, inspect it.  If the bird met the standard of the line, then it was to be hung on every 3rd shackle depending on how many people  were on the line with me.  Some days I had to hang the whole line by myself.  If the bird was A+ grade, then I had to throw it over the line into a vat which held about 500 birds.  I had to fill 22 of these vats by the end of each shift while hanging the line and training new hires on how to grade and hang.  My main coworkers were nice but always complaining about their pain.  The new hires usually did not last for more than a week before they quit.  I trained 55 employees and only 5 stayed during the year I was there.  The hardest part of my job was throwing the rotisserrie birds.  It was hard on my shoulder and the hanging was hard on my wrist but I still loved my job because of the respect I got from my superviser and GPM.  If circustances would have been different, then I would have been a superviser by now."
good,"Great Products and good culture. "
good,Great company with a great leader. Just stay away from Delivery Services.
good,"Fast acting non stop work,"
good,Great to work for this Co. because job security and good management environment
good,"I loved working here,shifts are fulltime and wear plenty of equipment for protection.The bosses do let you take bathroom breaks but it best to go on break.I learn the art of meat trimming and i will never forget the Tyson Pork plant."
good,It was a great learning experience. I gained a lot of experience on team work and safety on the job.
good,"The days at work are very long on a good day. I have learned many vital skills when it comes managing a diverse group of people. I have also learned a lot about completing time sensitive assignments as well as what it means to work with a customer focus. I liked that fact that I felt like I was part of a team. My co-workers are great, although we are all stressed at the moment and consumed with trying to meet demands that may be hard to obtain in a sense but can be done. The hardest part of my job is managing people by far. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing my team flourish and meet all of their goals on a daily basis. My only problem is my work hours. I need more time for my young family and my husband. Working seven days a week really takes a toll on the mind and body."
good,"My typical day at work consit of clocking in, grabing my apron and heading inside of the factory. Management where pretty good they kept me motivated, my co-workers where friendly always had fun when i work.Hardest part of the job was the cold it took some time to get use to. What i enjoyed most about the job i made alot of new friends that support me and at that time of my life i really needed that."
good,Enjoyed the challenge of being able to solve problems and contribute to the company's success.
good,the company was a great place to start getting my managment skills. everyone was a team player
good,"You go in and find out what your schedule was for that day and you do it productively. I have learned alot about grinding meat, making tickets for different types of materials. and driving a forklift to different areas of the warehouse and having to work with good dependable people was a plus.There was never a hard part to the job because management made it so easily for you to be able to do your job. I really enjoyed every"
good,"This job was very fast pace for the whole shift always on the move it was hard work heavey lifting all day, I had to make sure I did what I did the right way,usda was with me there was no easy way to do this job just the right way I did like this job"
good,Sara Lee Direct was a very good company to work for. The company appreciated it employees and rewarded them for a job well done. The managers were always supportive of any decisions made by the employees performing the function of the evening. The hardest part was dealing with perverts. The most enjoyable part of the job was assisting a customer with an order.
good,"Overall Tyson is a nice place to work. I'm looking for something with some different hours. 5:15 pm to 3:15 am is the scheduled time each day. I have a family and it's hard to be with them as the hours are starting to be a burden. I have strong work ethics. You can ask me to do something and consider it to be done. I am ""ocd"" when it comes to cleanliness and organizing. I get along with everyone and am praised about my job performance to an extent. Some of the managers do not recognize my hard work but I push on hoping for some gratitude. The job itself is fairly simple; keep things clean, supplies at ready, and stay within USDA regulations."
good,"This was a place you loved to go to every day. While the plant was atonomous, the employess were like one big, happy family."
good,"If you can endure extreme cold and extreme heat, then this is the job for you. Be careful not to fall, as the floor is always wet or slick with something. This is a rewarding job in the sense that you are looking out for the hundreds of thousands of people who will eat the poultry that you oversaw production over. Knowing that Pizza Hut, Tyson, Wal-Mart were all serving quality product and was healthy and prepared to the safety standards set."
good,Good place to get started. Management will work with its people. My co-workers are great people. The hardest part of the job is shipout orders
good,"Tyson Foods, was a great place to begin your career. training and structure was seriously emphasized. Tyson Foods, is a good growth opportunites for high-level performer."
good,Since it was my interns i did not have much to do but still i had to report to the VP finance. He helped me a lot in completing my project report as well as taught me things which i would have not learned sitting in a classroom
good,A typical day at work consists of getting your basic job functions done and helping others if there are any problems which need taken care of. I have learned a lot in this position from management and fellow co-workers. The hardest part of the job is making sure all of the daily job functions get complete when there are issues which need resolved. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to interact with many different people and their different personalities.
good,cool easy and you get paid to workout almost a dream come true except for the commute and the hours.
good,This was a high energy distribution warehouse with products coming and going in a fast and efficient manner.
good,People have a great attitude and very friendly however slow to adapt to change. Stuck in the way they do task. Lacking a sense of urgency but improving.
good,Tyson Foods was a excellent place of employement. During the experience i learned alot about being a team player to reach the companys goal.
good,sweet place to work. The work is hard but the pay is good.If you apply yourself you'll do very good. Show up on time and put it in the work. Just like any other factory job really.
good,"Una compañía que da oportunidades de crecer en todos los aspectos, gracias por por hacernos parte de tyson."
good,"Pay was great for the work, but they worked too many days sometimes 7 days a week without having a day off. Would have been better if we didn’t have to work almost every weekend."
good,I think that the company could be better if the management team was better. Communication is the key to having a successful work place. And I feel it’s not enough in my work area. If people would  be more respectful of others I think the company would be better. I love my job but I think I work hard and I could be in a higher position now!
good,Strong sense of family among fellow workers.  Long hours but nicely compensated.  Management was competent in their job and strived to help employees succeed.  Very diverse work environment.  Enjoyed most the fellowship among coworkers.
good,I enjoyed my job at Tyson because it gave me an opportunity to stretch my boundaries and learn new skills outside of my comfort zone. It also allowed me the opportunity to collaborate with multiple business units within the company.
good,"Walk barns, feed 2,600 hogs twice a day, give medicine if needed, give vaccines, assist farrowing, wean piglets, count pigs, read feed bins, fix broken water lines, fix broke crates, power wash crates, process piglets and supervise other hands."
good,Tyson is a good company to work for. The employees were very friendly and would lend a hand if needed. I learned that theres alot of work to process chicken.
good,"Tyson is a place for experience and competitive challenge. Goal is Customer’s, product, and profit. Safety is firsthand in order to reach our goals. Very ethical and family incorporated."
good,"Not much bad to mention, other than the union. Good pay, good management, good workers, good workers, good hours, great pay. Decent insurance and benefits"
good,the place was a fun place to work at i just say they need to get management that is on the same page so new workers dont get confused on what and what not to do
good,"Good overall experience, over time if your attendence is good you can advance fairly quick. Just like anything else in life results come from determination, goal setting, and patience."
good,It can be a best work place if some supervisor wasn't abusing of their title or authority.except that it's a nice place and the direction really Care about their employees.
good,"good pay but bad management, supervisors are never around and when they are they end up breaking stuff and slowing down production. lots of opportunities to go up in the world working here."
good,They will feed their people ice cream on Wednesday.  They feed their people when F.P. only works on weekends.  They want you to work all the time.  You don't have much time for family.  As long as you come to work you will have a job.  Management could be better
good,"Arrive on time; i.e., 8 AM at corporate offices, regardless of what you may see - It will make a difference. I was given wonderful opportunities for related job training from from a wealth of experience available in coworkers. My boss made tremendous efforts to help me be successful in my job role."
good,I got treated very good there. Very nice bosses and the pay was good. It was a fast paced job but after about a week you could keep up and the time passed by pretty quickly.
good,Company has changed over the last decade. System changes have made more problems than it has helped. Cannot tell direct manager anything that you do not want to be told. Work culture has gone from being more team player to thinking more about oneself and not the team as a whole. It is hard coming into work each day and working with a manager who seems unwilling to learn more about the job that their direct reports do on a daily basis so that they will better understand what we do.
good,its a good warehouse to work for as long as you dont mind the cold. depending on what you do there you may like it more than some others. I personally enjoy my time there for the most part.
good,"Enjoyed my time at Tyson Foods , only left  because I relocated to take care of family , have a good family based atmosphere , gave plenty of time if they may need you to work more than your normal schedule ."
good,It was easy to change jobs with a waiting period between transfer's. Open jobs were placed on bid cards that you would fill out. There were always plenty of options to choose from.
good,"It’s not always an easy job, but supervisors try to work with you and make things easy and fun. There needs to be more organization within the company, but nothing ever goes severely wrong. I enjoy working in the company store and have good hours that work for me."
good,This job provides a steady income.  It has great benefits.  Getting adjusted to knives and scissors are the hardest part of the job.  Management is ok.
good,Company tries to follow the 5 C's when possible. Unfortunately if you are not living in Arkansas you may have to relocate there at some point in your career with Tyson.
good,"work in Tyson is great, because the company really carrying it's team members with commitment and collaborative."
good,"Pay is good. I started at $11.70 and in less than a year I'm at $13.75. For your 1st 90 days (probation) you get no benefits. After 90 days you get a $1 raise and 2 paid vacation days. At one year you get a week of paid vacation. I think you can get up to 2 weeks paid vacation. Working 2nd shift (4p.m. to 2a.m.) gets you an additional $.35 per hour."
good,Advancement opportunities if you want them. Company offers many benefits. Gives jobs to people who wouldn't be able to get one due to their past. They are not quick to fire you. They give many chances to correct behavior that is inappropriate.
good,I enjoy my almost 10 years with the company. Most individuals were glad to roll up their sleeves and go to work each day. People were cordial and collaborative for the most part.
good,It have a mixer of young and older people both men and women. Cold environments. We have lockers to store things. They a have a place to buy hot foods. And close convient restaurants
good,My experience as a District Manager with Tyson is something different every day.  Managing Costco Roadshows and Retail Events require time management and human relations all in one.
good,Good place to work good culture and room for advancement. They have some problems with advanced notice of overtime. I would recommend this job to anyone looking for advancement in career.
good,Good place to work. Have had some good experiences while here.  Great people onsite but corporate oversight has the mentality that all facilities are created equal.
good,"My opinion was valuable to my manager and I was included when appropriate in decisions that related to my position."
good,"Tyson Foods has several campuses stemming from Arkansas, North Dakota, Ohio, & Chicago so the culture is very diverse and each campus has it's on culture whether it's good or bad."
good,"I accompanied industry professionals to farms throughout North Carolina and helped monitor the health of the animals."
good,"Tyson has a great culture and focuses on the protein space in the dynamic food industry. Specifically, those in the finance and marketing departments have a wealth of experience and work cooperatively together."
good,"Typical work days was low stress management of work processes with multiple critical incidents to keep you energized.  Consistent work environment with good benefits.  Not much that one would ask from a job, but I need to be challenged in a much higher scale.  Trying to reach other positions that would provide this need was difficult to accomplish."
good,"Nice consistent work, opportunity for advancement, good environment, clean, friendly people, and above all saftey first motto, I would recommend Tyson foods as a place to start a career."
good,I been with tysin ten years total. Its a good job to have cause there is room for you to grow. I was a line worked and promoted up in the company. Fast pace but will to help you learn. Great boss that helped me become supervisor and helped me believe in myself and made me feel like family
good,"is fun drive forklift and is good enjoy the break time,with the team worker .I like the safety meeting every day before we start our shift ,"
good,enough pay and good benefits. some people were nice to work with and some were not. management was not communicative. union did not help with my problems.
good,I loved tyson I left because family issues.It's a good job it's not hard it's easy learning.I work good and hard for them and I would recommend anybody to work there
good,"Great job culture. They are very involved with employees and appreciate them by doing dinners, giveaways, and education. One of the best places I’ve worked at."
good,"Working at Tyson was interesting in the fact that you could learn different areas of how to process chickens. The environment was different because you sometimes had to work in the cold, or in the hear, and sometimes get wet. All in all it was good. What i Didn't like is some of the managers could careless if you were sick or not. They had no compassion for their employees when it came to their health. Or pray tell if you had an emergency in your family. I did like the pay and al management was rude or inconsiderate. Never home on Weekends."
good,"one must b a hard worker n work 6 days a week straight regardless how tired you may feel. its very hard to schedule a scheduled day off even though orientation said it would be possible. the night turn is better and pays better, you can also move up faster at night then you could on days, but if you have kids, that's a sacrifice."
good,Good place too work. Help develop and guide entry level workers with the tools to succeed. Pay and benefits are good. One of the better poultry companies.
good,"As written above, it has its ups and down. Freezer, refrigeration work environment. Fast paced, and lack of employees at the facility make it even harder."
good,It was ok management was very strict. I learned to drive forklifts. Hardest part was the heat it is a very warm work area. Workplace area is well sorted out.
good,"Long standing in a cold place. Flipping an packing all night. Sometimes u have to wait do to line breaking down or fridge is down.. Make up days if your line been down too long, Even on Sunday"
good,The job pays the bills but poor managment and long hours no time with your family. You can meet all kinds of people and also advance within the job because there are so many job positions
good,"My time at Tyson was not so bad, my Hardest days was on Mondays of course  like every other Monday, over all Tyson is a great place to work as long as you leave your personal life "
good,Great pay awesome job opportunity and growth. Management could be better and work environment could be less stressful. It's a good place to work if your looking to be more involved in the company it's a production company so be prepared to work. There are some pros and cons like any job.
good,It was a good experience I would recommend anyone to go and experience the opportunity the company provides. The management is outstanding and they have really good health h insurance.
good,Great place to work if you can tolerate the cold and not ever knowing when your shift is over. Breaks were fair and given a lot of nice people to work with
good,"i have alot of explain use knife.im a good worker and good comminaca to the supersive, im learning very fast , we butcher the bone and i always hlep people when im free."
good,"complete orders for customers on time"
good,"Good learning experience, great opportunity to grow professionally, fun co-workers, excellent hands on learning. Tyson provide opportunities to apply for other positions."
good,Tyson Foods is a great job for anybody that love chicken . You can learn a lot from Tyson from the market to the sells it's.Tyson Foods gives you the chance to show your work skill Like shoulder cutting is the mast important job n debone department you got to know how to cut and when to cut and how deep to cut  not every day you'll be in the same spot
good,"There is improvement in the work break before there were 2 breaks only now they put up three breaks and the more minutes is paid up in the break.  The ergonomics people and the supervisors have in common differences in implementing new techniques in work places because each has its own reasons: the supervisors is more incline in more production and quality whereas the ergonomics is likely  to give workers ease and pleasant working situation. You can see the difference when implementing the technique when it would affect each other objectives. About the supervisors I observe there is always a double standards of implementing work rules.  They are more lenient to their same blood and strict to other race. People working in the lines are making the work as competition not as helping each other work or in other words the do not heed to the motto: ""I got your back"". This is only my observation and fact finding. Thank you very much."
good,Tyson was a different environment but I learned what it was like to work for a major company. They focused alot on repetitive motion injuries and body mechanics and trying to prevent those injuries.
good,Tyson is a very different kinda job. Everybody there is either for u or against you. They say everybody got your back but as soon as you hit the floor it's a different story. Over all it's a blessing nice ppl
good,"Good place to make a living. have a safety culture invested in the company. Great place to work your way up, if you don't have a college degree. Great team."
good,Tyson foods is a great company to work for. Great benefits and good pay. But management in my location wasn’t the best. Still all in all liked my time at tyson
good,"The job can get boring because you are working in a chicken factory. The pay is good, but the work can be heavy. It all depends on which area of the plant you are working in."
good,Need more money and looking for something new to do.. trying to better myself and my family they frawn upon not have a degree so it’s hard to move up in a salary job..
good,Tyson it's a good place to work but. They not take care the employees. People have a lot a time working they give more chances to the new employees. The supervisor want friends not a employee. But I respect decision and just going to do my obligation. Thanks
good,Good pay but bad management and hours are long in some department's and good health benifits and last time I worked their I had a bad suporviser......
good,"Had to make sure employees were following safety guideline. Make sure the line is setup correctly on product that had to be ran, make sure date code was on the box correctly. And make sure each employee wearing correct GMP."
good,A typical day was very fast paced. Operating the stand up forklift was an everyday allday essential job function. It was a very cold working environment. And that was the biggest downside.
good,"I wonderful Company that you can grow with and work your way up. Safety is the number one focus ,Putting out Quality Products is a big factor. Trainings are offered to you Frequently."
good,Excellent place to work especially if you like chicken. Super great benefits for the family and great dental! Easy work just come to work and do your job
good,"When the line is moving, you have to pay attention. If you are not paying attention then you might have to stop the entire line causing other people to wait just because you did not want to pay attention."
good,Great company to work for. Must be able to work in extremely cold temperatures but other than that this is a good company to work for. 10 hour set shifts allow for work/family balance.
good,"This is a great company to work for with great opportunities for advancement.  Great insurance and benefits, but extremely long work hours.  I would recommend Tyson to others as a good place to work."
good,Very relaxed working environment with great vending machines for breaks. The workplace was great in general but it was a different culture with me being an African American. I sometimes felt like I was treated different from other minority employees
good,Tyson is taking big steps to get rid of the old packing house stigma and turn a new leaf as a preferred employer. deffinately happy I came back to work here.
good,Freezer work 30 degrees all day lifting heavy boxes. Good place to work with benefits and hours offered.  Employees work well together and help each other out.
good,"Once you move into middle management, benefits are not very good. Pay is the same for this position. If you want to stay hourly then this place is 5*'s. Do not progress from shop floor leader. You do get paid weekend work (regular per hour pay)."
good,"I learned how to work with production equipment's, clean the equipments. The workplace culture is varied. The management is good. a typical day at work consisted on maintain a high production and quality ensuring a safe working environment, control the production process according to the policies of the company. Pack boxes and seal the tortillas packs quickly. Clean the production equipment's as well as the work area."
good,"Great place to work before the big layoffs of 2017 when Tyson purchased AdvancePierre Foods in Cincinnati-OH.  They let go of a lot of great people, but that's business"
good,"Tyson Foods Incorporated is an amazing place to work for and I would enjoy doing it again if given the chance. I made good money, tried to help make our jobs easier. I enjoyed working with different cultures as well."
good,the pay is not competitive as some of the other company's that carry the same role. The hours can get long sometimes and I think the management team could be a little better
good,Tyson foods is a great place to work if you like to actually work. You stay busy so time goes by fast. Supervisors make sure that you know what you're doing.
good,Its a good place to work. Pay is good and decent houra. Some departments work more than others but overall its a great place to work. Some supervisors are cool some are temperamental
good,clocking in on time which is 5:50am 
good,Tyson Foods Inc. is a great place to work. They honor a great working area and provide useful learning to better be accomplished in this field. I would advise anyone to work in this field.
good,"Tyson Foods is a high paced enviroment that can become stressful due to the tempatures and repetitive movements on certain body parts. overall its a great company, but has room for improvement"
good,Tyson is an entry level company. The benefits are excellent. I have learned a great deal of things since  being employed with the company.  I enjoy going to work and talking with my co-workers.
good,Tyson is a great place to work. But the management is new there. It will be okay there. Thay just have to work out some Kinks. And I love the benefits. Their insurance is great.
good,"I really liked working at Tyson. It was sometimes cold in the area I worked, but I still had some good times.  The benefits and salary were also sufficient.  The chance of job advancement was not very good."
good,"I work in the labeling department as a scaler love my job very easy. Long hours,great benefits and we are getting a bonus. We have production for box counts but most don't come close to it. I noticed alot of entitlement at work. People walk off lines for as long as they want, go smoke when not suppose to. I noticed the sorry and lazy a person is they get the easy jobs. Hard worker that gets box counts goes unnoticed. I have a great supervisor but there is a sorry one who has favorite and gives them pie jobs. Always drama people starting stuff. I stay to myself. They also offer Hyatt law group which has allowed me to gain custody of my children."
good,"I spent most of my time ensuring my employees were happy and did their job.  I made sure I meet the daily goal.  Some of the senior superiors are very nice and teach me new skills, but some are just hateful."
good,"Production environment is fast paced and challenging, engaging office work with many challenges. Company provides a lot of opportunity to grow for its employees and most members of management excel in demonstrating the core values of the company."
good,"When I first start it was a great day working and learning about the knowledge of the company and the employee plus the of the surrounding, the hardest is standing when training with the person until he/ she give you the break. The enjoyable part of the job is when the person the training you tells you that its a great job that you have done and you give them a big smile for that day then go home and come back the next day and start that task without help that a great feeling."
good,This is a massive company that is very profitable. Entire management structure from CEO to lowest levels of knowledge workers recently reorganized. Culture is very old and not as worldly considering company ranking on Fortune 100 list. This is mostly due to HQ's location in NW Arkansas and lack of inclusion of employees with broad experience elsewhere. The majoruty of senior positions are held by people with 20 years of experience at Tyson and nowhere else.
good,"my review of tyson is that its a great place for people without or with education to advance in life and become successful. As long as you abide by the rules, show up for work and have a positive attitude you will have a positive outcome."
good,"Friendly place to work. A good mix of all ages and demographics. People here are genuinely helpful and even though it is a larger company, it still has a “family” feel to it."
good,"Just not enough weekends off"
good,I enjoyed working at Tyson. Had friendly people who worked there and were willing to show you how things were done. Sometimes the hours that were worked depended on the amount of chickens being processed.
good,"Great care is taken at Tyson to prevent contamination, many levels of safety are involved. The company always puts product safety as a very high goal.  Cleanliness is stressed and it became part of my job immediately. I enjoy working with a team and Tyson provided that with all the shifts I worked. I always felt that I was part of the big picture."
good,I appreciate the opportunity this company gave me starting out. Great starter job. Descent Benefits and room for growth. Employees becomes like family.
good,Job is okay at times. Just depends on supervisor and what job you actually have in your department. I loved it. If your like me you will be able to find slower jobs for more money.
good,Excellent place to work for those first coming out of college. Room for growth if you live near a corporate office and can turn into a lifetime career.
good,I really liked working at Tyson my Supervisor was awesome.  I would recommend Tyson as a place to work to someone who is interested in an employment opportunity with this company.
good,ok the supervisors always wanted you to work faster but could hardly keep up. Cold room since you were working with raw chicken. most employees were very friendly
good,"Tyson's is a job that would be good to get a second chance in life. the  company it tries to help it employees, but you would have to take matters in your on hands"
good,"Tyson pays good, it is hard work in cold, damp conditions.  A lot of drama in the work place like alot of other places but if you are willing to do a good job and stay out of trouble it is a great place to work."
good,"Fast paced, repetitive, difficult, long hours, overtime, dirty work environment. Good benefits, good pay, good co-workers, good lunch."
good,Tyson is a great place to work at. tI was a jack of all trades there. I was able to be trained anywhere my supervisor deemed necessary. At times I was working 3 different jobs in a timely matter.
good,The company is good but I feel like it's going down hill. When it gets busy it's gets busy. Lots of Saturday's and Sunday's if falling behind. Most departments only have 2 shifts.
good,"If you can stand the cold 3-4 days a week in 12-hour shifts, this is the place for you.You are able to sign up for overtime, yes sometimes it is mandatory.Rotating Saturdays."
good,It was okay in my book. It's just that I didn't like the fact that I was in a cold place and that my hands and feet where frozen most of the time I was there. I would concerned coming back if I had an different position.
good,i leaned  so much from working there from nothing  i didnt know then i stated from  the bottom  to i got somthing from tyson  grom welding  to carpeting to troubleshoot.
good,"I first got hired five years ago, and I worked until I was put on maternity leave. When I first started, we rarely work Saturdays, but now we do. We work an average of 60 hours a week. I just came back to Tyson last month after working at Perdue. Tyson will take care of you, but you have to be willing to work. Management is okay, and the best advice I can say is stay to yourself and focus on your money!"
good,"Tyson allows for upward mobility and a competitive salary.  Team Members in IT are assigned by project and perform in a lead role.  Responsibilities include working with business partners to develop strategies, engage resources, execute, and measure success. Atmosphere of team work and completing the job.  Times of stress intensify 3 months prior to implementation.  The most enjoyable part is seeing the user comfort level with the new system after the implementation."
good,"Working here on a typical day ran smoothly, just like any other job they want it done so everyone done it so there was no problems. Not saying there was no problems, but the good weighed out the bad."
good,"Overall not a bad company, good management with a lot of support."
good,"Tyson foods is a good place too work alot of different options as far as job in the building , i worked there for 3 years with out any problems money is great"
good,"tysons is good constant work although depending where you r, some difficult on ur arms and hands. Seem to go through supervisors like crazy. second shift hours are sometimes really really late and its hard to transfer to dayshift."
good,Tyson Foods is a good place to work and has great benefits for their team members. It is family oriented and believe in treating their team members fairly.
good,Tyson Foods is hard work is very cold but they compensate you well for your work also there is a lot of opportunity for advancement or just to change job positions if you like
good,If you love having a life outside of work this job is NOT for you. I loved working with the company once I became a member of the third shift Sanitation team. Before that I was a second shift production worker and the hours are long and unpredictable. I went to work from 5 and sometimes didn't get off til 3 and 4 in the morning. First shift is a set amount of hours and so is sanitation because they have to be done at a certain time for production to start.
good,"nice cafeteria ,but too many stairs to clomb going on break,plus if you can get over the smell its a nice place to work good managment nice parking lot"
good,Great company to work for if you can accept the hours.  Sometimes you may work 13 days  until you get a day off.  This job doesn't support my and my wife's schedule so we have family time.
good,schedule was 2nd shift which worked out fine for me at the time. worked well with my peers and felt like there was teamwork. met my goals each day and helped production start up.
good,Work at Tyson is fast pace production driven environment.  The production and maintenance crew work hard to maintain the sales targets.  The production/operation/maintenance staff work will together to achieve the goals. Plant is very safety orientated.
good,"Learned how the process went from beginning to end for the product."
good,it was my first journey with godraj industry. i got to know so many things. training was one of them. it was a good working invoirnment over there. it was a good company
good,"The hours are long and there is no such thing as family comes first.  I was forced to work both night and days.  This made my sleep pattern terrible. Every day was  challenge.  The benefits were great but it was not worth all the hours and mistreatment from my supervisor.  It has the potential to be a place to retire from, but hospitality towards team members and certain member of management was terrible."
good,"Tyson Foods, Inc. is a great place to work.  It has good benefits and good management training.  However, your success greatly depends on who you work for.  The best thing is to pay attention and take in all the knowledge and advice you come across because it can be the difference between getting promoted or being in a department for a long period of time."
good,Working for Tyson Food was one the best jobs I have ever had.  The atmosphere and Management team were great!  Everyone made you feel like family and that was great!
good,I enjoyed working here everyday was very challenging everyday there was something new everyday the hardest part was when there was short of help I learned something new everyday
good,"Hard fast work"
good,it is hard to move up at Tyson unless you Know the right people and or Friends with them. When they buy out another company it seems like they let the other company take over. They have no loyalty to employees that have dedicated 20 + years to them>
good,I enjoyed working at Tyson I just wish I had more time to do things outside of work.  The management was great and really works with you on any issues you have.
good,"it is a effective an productive workplace  you learn about loading"
good,Non interfering job environment. Fair assessment of your achievements. Timely payment of salary & insensitive. TA DA as per the industry norms. H R policies were good. On the whole it was fun working for the organisation.
good,Full grown people acting like a bunch of high school girls. You have to watch what you say but certain people can say whatever they want however they want and they expect you to bite your tongue
good,"Is ok to work is a very good company with a good reputation and also salary is very good ,the safety is excellent ,also they have  nice   personnel in HR ."
good,Not a badplace tork there is some head ache co works are good to work with. Lots of OT available works with seniority it is also a union plant lots of growth opirtunity
good,"Good Leadership, fair evaluation, compensation and good opportunities for those that prove they can perform.  Everyone likes to make the workday as fun as it can be, and innovation is welcome and frequent."
good,"Tyson was a good place to work, It was a fast paced environment but very wet and had some aspects I would not recommend for the faint at heart or people with weak stomachs. The People I worked with were awesome, very group orientated and when problems arose. Everyone was quick to jump in to get the problem resolved without hesitation. Management I worked with were very open minded and willing to weight the opinions of their maintenance and production personnel fairly before making and major decisions. Everyone understood the reason they were there without question, to get quality product out the door."
good,"Great place to grow and learn many of the basic skills when you have little to no experience. The hardest part of the job is the learning curve of getting the hang of maintenance. The most enjoyable part of the job is fixing the problem and knowing that its fixed. Management could be better, there are a couple higher ups who could handle things more serious when it comes to their job."
good,Tyson foods in Pine Bluff is a great place to work from the time you come in the door the management works you in and treats you very well. There is a cafeteria on sight which serves food and you can charge directly out of your check.
good,Great benefits for management. The enviroment can be  rude and cruel. it is very cold and wet. People can be very abrassive. Its a job that takes excellent people skills to maintain an sane mind.
good,I enjoyed working for this company. Learned a lot about chicken processing job requires a lot of consentration to details in handling og chicken. Many different job sections within the company
good,"I liked working at Tyson's. It just wasn't the job I was wanting, but it was wonderful experience. I have learned alot since I have worked at Tyson's. I can change an osid over fairly quickly with all the practice I have had, althought I have learned alot of other intresting things."
good,Worked up to 12 hours M-F. Got along easy with my co-workers. The hardest part of my job was learning how to do it. There is a right way on how to do it. The enjoyable part of it is having it mastered and knowing when its time to go home and the paychecks every week.
good,"The start of the day is the most key point of production level and tells you what kind of work day you are going to have. I learned the performance of my task can dictate the team member [performance ahead of me. I learned to be an overall good team player their. Picking up the next employees slack makes the job very hard. The most enjoyable part is quality production being pushed out, and the happiness of going home after a hard days work."
good,"My responsibility was to make sure that the meat was straight coming down the assembly line and there was nothing else on the line. I work with a great team, we became a family. We all had our ups and downs,but we was able to always pull through. We knew how to put our problems or feelings to the side when it came down to work and we made our production majority of the time"
good,"I worked 12 hour days 4 days a week. I had 3 days off every week which was nice. I had to learn a lot on my own, and management wasn't always helpful. There was a lot of politics going on that could discourage some people."
good,"Favoritism is a huge problem at the facility I worked for. Sometimes the managers are very critical to certain team members and at times even belittle them. Tyson Foods as a company I give 2 thumbs up, but the Sedalia Mo. planning 2 thumbs down. Team members should be treated with respect and not have to work in a hostile environment."
good,Empresa muito boa de trabalhar com muito dinamismo e competência.
good,"Fast pace line work. Management could use some work, but learned quite a bit of skills and techniques. Typical day of work was productive, sometimes slow, and had to work in either extreme cold or heat work environment. Very hands on work. Meeting different people from different backgrounds,  cultures, parts of the world, and work experiences was very enjoyable."
good,"overall Tyson food inc was a great job. it allowed me to provide for my family, job security great benefits, overtime was available each week."
good,No weekend or holidays off. Work as seasonal until you get in as a regular employee. Had to work 10 day no time off around the Holidays. I don't know if they do that yet or not.
good,"During my time period it was awesome , only thing that got in the way was transportation at the time being . very friendly and confidential. Also fabulous benefits."
good,Good place to work. Tyson is a faith friendly company and goes out of their way to make people feel at home. Good place to get started off in a new career.
good,My coworkers at Tyson Mexican Original were very helpful and friendly. A great team oriented environment and great coworkers.
good,A typical day at Tyson consist of putting rib eyes in a try making sure the product looks well in the trays for our Wal-Mart customer's to purchase.
good,"a typical day has a meeting with the crew before working to go over the days issues. the supervisor has stuff for the hourly employees (pay stubs, benefits, misc.) the crew would leave the same time to find all the product that would change locations daily to the most fulfilling time to go home after the work is done if not almost completely new day for the next shift"
good,"Some days are good and some days are just down right tiresome. Everyday is about the same, never anything new. Its what you make out of it."
good,"This company offered great pay and great benefits, the downside is the cold work conditions as well as the favortisim. Still learn a lot."
good,"I learned a lot being a smokehouse operator,I learned the importance of making sure the temps of our meat were logged correctly and accurately for USDA. We had to make sure our meat went into the correct ovens and when an oven was full make sure the probes were in the meat on the ends so we got accurate temps throughout the cook process had to work close with my co workers and supervisor had to trust them in what we were doing so no one got hit by a tree of meat or the cooking process wasn't done right and when we were working those stretches of 12 hour days 7 days a week to keep a good attitude and help the others to keep a good and positive attitude. the hardest part of my job would of been the trollies on our trees weren't the best on some and were very hard to move so we had to count on our co workers to help each other out or get the forklift to change them out I had a good team to work with we all knew we had to be very aware of everything that we did to stay safe on the job but we also had fun doing our jobs and made sure everyone was treated equally and fair, I would have to say that one of the perks of my job was working with the people that I did and the management people were also great to work with they were on the same level as the workers, they listened to what we had to say like if we thought something would be easier doing it a different way they would let us try it not like some that would immediately say this is the way its done and its gonna stay that way.Would love to work in that kind of an atmosphere again."
good,"Buen ambiente laboral con gran apoyo entre compañeros y jefes inmediatos, donde se observa una empresa estandarizada."
good,"If you show great attendance, and a desire to advance within the company, they will give you the opportunity to grow, and try different things."
good,"Good supervisors, always on the outlook for problems and fixing those problems. Co-workers became part of your life when you're standing next to them for 8 hours.Job got difficult when everyone didn't cooperate or the machines would cause a delay."
good,Tyson is over all a good company to work for. The hours are long. But at the end of the work day you know you have accomplished something. Management could be a little more understanding and step up their game when short handed.
good,Tyson keeps you busy with something to do I learned how to operate machines while working there. The management was ok wasn't the best I had good coworkers some helpful some where lazy the hardest part was shoveling chicken once the machine breaks down
good,"Productive, on the phone with vendors and supervising"
good,"Great place to work, good amount of overtime, hot in the summer."
good,Well overall it was good working there nice people very friendly. The hardest thing on the job is not knowing when you get off.
good,management wasnt all that great but the supervisors are easy to get along with. the employes are to. sometimes worked long hrs the pay was ok
good,Was A good place to work. Learned a lot how to run big blenders food measuring in bulk operate a motorized pallet jack Learned leadership skills
good,"the hardest part was management didn't have our back, the most enjoyable part was we had each others an i loved working with the people who i worked with"
good,"Very productive work culture.  Management allows you to become a strong leader.  "
good,"Es una compañia que aprendes mucho de diferentes areas por ser muy grade la cadena del proceso."
good,"Early Mornings"
good,"Great benefits and Job security, plenty of overtime in the summer. Something diffrent to do every day.I would recomend this job."
good,"Smuckers was a good place to work with a great culture. The benefits were top notch."
good,Tyson is an awesome company with great people in some places.  Sixteen hour shifts create a stressful environment.  Love helping people but the hardest part is dealing with know it alls
good,There were bad days and good day. It was a very fast paced job but nothing that i couldn't handle. I did learn many skill i hope to use in future employment.
good,The actual job itself wasn't to bad. It was just so cold all shift and really made my bones stiff and sore. Packed chicken to get it ready to send out to stores.
good,I enjoyed working there.  I had several different tasks to do daily involving different levels of people.  I loved working with all levels of production. I enjoyed being on different types of teams such as safety and plant improvement.  I was able to multitask and get my tasks done and help others.
good,"As a management level team member, I was required to be on call 24/7 due to being the only IT person for the facility. My work included daily PC, server, and printer maintenance and support. Door access security maintenance and support, and CCTV maintenance and support."
good,a day come in and work bust ice and drive a fork truck the bosses was nice the co workers had there head in the wrong place most of the time
good,"Good job and actually enjoyed working there. I worked well with management, as well as co-workers. The most difficult part of the job, was when the equipment broke down for a long duration. The best part of my job, was my athority to run my own area. Also the athority to train my co-workers safely, and in a organized fast paced environment."
good,fast-paced place to work at with various customer to deal and work with...
good,Job allows time with family. Management are very supportive.
good,"Sara Lee did a lot of things right... the benefits/salary was good, work/life balance was respected, lots of room for advancement. But for me personally, it was too big and the culture was a bit cold."
good,Very Productive and exciting place to work at. I learn how to operate different types of machines at this company....the management team was always helpful to me......and the co-workers was also great.
good,"I enjoyed working at Tyson Foods, Inc. you are first aid responders, and lots of hands on wound care as well as patient care."
good,Tyson is a good workplace but possibilities of advancement are limited and management capabilities are not great.
good,"Mainly same daily routine day in day out.  Did learn a few things about microbiological analysis.  Management for the most part was done from another room and did not have much contact with personnel.  As with most jobs some coworker great, others need not be there (cause more problems than help).  Hardest part was probably non involvement of management and the vacuum it caused (ie others thinking they were the boss).  Most enjoyable part was job security and the pay (one of the better paying jobs in the area).   The lab rooms themselves were very poor, concrete block walls and floors, maintenance on lab building itself virtually nonexistent, counters, cabinettes, floors not repaired since building put into service (>20 yrs). No windows at all.  Lab equipment rarely replaced, often time Gerry rigged..."
good,Tyson is a very competitive and cost driven company that will be the most successful food producer in the world.  They have a very sound management team and great succession planning.
good,Even though I kept to myself there were some who kept me laughing. They were the type to have fun while we worked through the night.
good,"cold but good advancement,management support in billing, filing paperwork and billing of orders foreign and domestic of fresh and frozen meats. WE have the cooperation of the federal borough of inspection too approve the quality and safety of the product. Should the USDA not approve of the paper work or product is rejected.  I also run the office that I am in to assure the drivers pick up the loads before deadline and direct them to where they can find there trailers in a timely manner."
good,"working in the maintenance department allowed me to see all areas of the plant, which helped me to understand the bigger picture of how everything tied together.  i was able to meet people thought out the plant building relationships and working together with that person on how better to improve that area of work.  Tyson Foods provided lunch many times through cook outs or cafe' coupons to cover the cost.  I was lucky enough to win tickets to sporting events that Tyson had season tickets to, such as Blackhawks Hockey games and UNI events.  I enjoyed playing softball every year in the yearly tournament. Tyson's is however a hog plant so the enviroment and daily smell was not the most enjoyable."
good,"When I was with IBP/Tyson at the time, I mainly work with the process department and the CSA department."
good,"co-workers where fun to work with,overall job was fun learned a lot and hands training was good"
good,la mempresaa en que la boro es bonita con gente divertida pero quiero algo diferente para mi carrera.

good,productive  learned comunication alot had fun an learned to worktogether  makes my job alot easier  and as a team
good,"A typical day at work would be standing for long period's of time, I learned how to care for, and produce. A nice clean product for market and consumption. Management was always on the spot for Q&A very helpful and very insightful. My co-worker's came from all walk's of life they were intelligent and very helpful. the hardest part of the job was finding a parking spot. The most enjoyable part of the job was the job it self."
good,hang birds with a group of guys that don't take pride in their job. I learned everybody don't work the same. My supervisor is great she's on her job. My co-workers wont hang like their suppose to to make the other guys job harder
good,I enjoy being able to help my co-workers out of tough situation that they get themselves into sometimes. My co-workers are like my family members we have our ups and downs but mainly it's our ups. I keep a smile on my face everyday. I was told that I make everyone day when I come in because no matter what the situation is I am smiling.
good,I learned allot about the coffee business from beginning to end. I learned about the production and manufacturing of coffee. I supervised 16 service reps in the day to day business of taking orders for both private and retail customers for coffee. The hardest part of my job was having a manager that judged my performance both on a racial level and personal level.
good,Constant training and learning. I was able to develop management skills.
good,"good job "
good,safest environment you can be in. management is great. You learn alot about the quality of the product you produce. You learn how you impact the entire process. Hardest part is the hours. Your there at least 10 hours a day. minimum. Enjoyable part is working with your employees growing them and making them better. 
good,"Typical day consisted of stocking shelves, filling product shortfalls in the market, and answering costumer questions. I had a lot of independence and was afforded the opportunity to analyze my tasks and optimize my efficiency. I had great management while I was there. It was interesting working in a union shop and it taught me the value of doing a favor for a coworker."
good,"Well a average day, consist of always knowing"
good,All in all I tried to excel and to do my very best. A lot of good people to work with.
good,"I enjoy working there, not just with my workers but the job itself is decent."
good,Hillshire Brands workplace has a good environment where the work was fairly easy because the machines basically dose all the work all you need to make sure was that you have grade A product going through the machine at all time
good,"Tyson was a challenging place to work. Very physical it but a beating on the body. Stacking 90 pound boxes loading trucks palletizing meat, organizing freezers. Driving a forklift filling orders within a deadline. The temperature was extremely cold working in a freezer basically. Management was okay sometimes I felt they needed to be more organized because we would end up stacking off to many boxes they would send on the line and then we would have too throw them back up on another line to the freezer because there was shipment for them. That was the hardest part of the job the double work and the beating on the body and temperature. The best part was the people that worked there very diverse and there were a lot of company parties and activities."
good,"My job title was machine operator, duties where to run the bread moulder. That directly affected the overall quality of the bread. The machine I operated weighed the dough pieces, then shaped each individual piece to a specific size and shape. If steps where missed then the overall product would be no good. Also had to maintain my work area and ensure that it stayed clean. While in this position, the quality ranking of the bread rose from below average scores to outstanding(54-98). Due to that I was invited to a corporate meeting in St. Louis to share my observations used to improve the quality of our overall product. Also was asked how this process could and should be implemented at other locations. My co-workers and I always worked as a single unit, cause if one part of the line would go down then the whole facility would shut down. The hardest part of the job was problem solving when machines would not operate correctly. But thats what was most enjoyable also, the whole problem solving process."
good,On a typical day of work it runs smooth. At times the lines run on a faster pace in order to get the needed pounds through to the next department. Everyone that I work with works together as a team in order to get the job done. The hardest part of the job is the time between starting the day and break and from break to the end of the day.
good,"-Early mornings moving at a fast pace,"
good,"On your feet the whole time, you learn a lot and can make a career out of working there. I liked the four tens and the people i was around."
good,"Trabalho no turno da noite acho muito bom, trabalho com uma excelente equipe, para realiza tarefas do dia a dia, aprendi a ser mais agiu pois é uma empresa grande e temos que atender vários setor, a parte mais agradável e esta todos os dia trabalhado no que gostamos.."
good,"hanging chicken, front line inspecting chicken before going into the chillers, Inspecting chicken for quality control before shipping of product, packaging of product for outgoing product. I learned how to do all that by just working there, The hardest part was working front line in the summertime while being pregnant. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with."
good,A good solid company to work for. Safety a high priority and very flexible attendance policy.
good,I work approximately 55-60 hours weekly. My work day is fast paced and challenging from start to finish. Each day presents different challenges and keeps you on your toes which is the most difficult aspect of my job. I enjoy working with other departments to meet plant goals and expectations.
good,A typical day is seeing how you can contribute to satisfying the customer in the most cost beneficial way.
good,"Daily meeting, planning, controls and documentation follow-up."
good,Loading product into step van.
good,"Good job. You will always have a job. It's hard to balance life and work. You have flexibility, for the most part. Gets stressful, don't see a lot of your co workers. I'm a family person and me liking to be around family makes this job really hard. The pay is good an i guess it helps you get your foot in the door to other opportunities."
good,Company is focused and organized. Lives by core values. They are commited to doing things right.
good,I started at Tyson as an employee and couldn't stand the smell. After a couple of weeks the smell diasppeared. It was hard for me to accept the process on how animals was used to feed the world. Slaughtering in the Pork division is where I started and ended up in Beef Processing.
good,"great company, ok benifits, was able to influence my paycheck week to week"
good,This a great company to work for. Unfortunately they did a company wide downsize and I was caught up in it. I had only been with the company for 1yr when it happened. They are a bit behind on technology but were making progress. Overall I would strongly recommend.
good,"As most companies, they have flaws but very generous overall. They benefits are excellent. I’m just typically looking for something more challenging and something within my major."
good,It's not a bad spot to work at but be prepared for a lot of feet dragging by upper management when trying to get stuff the department needs other then that just use common sense and you will be fine
good,"Kept the machines running working in a team group."
good,Meet new great team worker and learn a lot from great team work and safety..great working environment and safety place to work..learn how to work and communicate with team work
good,Job offers good pay once you qualify at a job you get a higher pay raise and is nice because you can being doing literal nothing and be making a whole bunch of money
good,Very good work environment to work in. Loved coming to work and learning new safety rules and regulations to teach to others. My job always required me to put safety first.
good,"It's a fair and competive company wage wise, and excellent benifit package. The work is hard and tiresome on the body. However there's room for growth and advancement. It's a friendly and family vibe throughout the plant atmosphere."
good,"Tyson is great with communication and organization. They are friendly and will work with you. "
good,"I enjoyed the job and would recommend others. Fast environment, friendly people, great benefits. You are.  Amongst family . Daily sales at the job. Great food."
good,It’s a really good job to work at also good money as well it’s a far place to drive if you don’t live within city limits but the pay makes up for it of course.
good,Good place to start for entry level workers and students that want to futher knowledge and experience. Virtual training to help with hands on. Cross training in all departments and fields. Excellent benefits packages. Tuition assistance and daycare reimbursement etc.
good,"GREAT work culture. Very supportive cross functional partnerships. Tyson is an incredible place to work for Brand Management. It is a very innovative organization, and you can make a real impact on your life"
good,"I clock in get dressed up and make my rounds to every part of the plant to make sure everything is working properly, learned how different machines always never be the exact same to fix, getting up everyday making a living for me and my family"
good,I am very blessed to be a team member at Tyson. I value my job and am also mutually valued by my supervisor. I was trained very well and have an awesome work environment. The health/dental insurance is very affordable and good coverage.
good,Hard work good pay excellent benefits. If it wasnt for my injury i would've stayed would recommend this job to everyone who wants a job and not afraid of hard work.
good,Good place to work money is good just gotta deal with their freezer (-5 degrees). Management is kinda laid back. Training is good company meat sales every quarter
good,As does any place it has its pros and its cons. It paid very well. The work was demanding on some jobs but not too demanding on others and they usually put you where you were comfortable and most likely to succeed at. Some managers were very good but the change in management happened happened so often it was bad at times.
good,"I have had some good and some bad experiences. Overall the only good experience is my paycheck. If you want weekly pay an pretty decent benefits, Tyson Foods is the place."
good,Very fast pace and competitive. Fun place to work it was just so far way. Depends on the job the pay was compensated. It was good team to work for and management was great.
good,It was a good place to work and you are around a lot of good people.  It was very diverse and interesting being around people from other countries. The job also had good benefits and pay.
good,"Working on the evening shift meant you would come in late and get out late, the job is tedious as you're more than likely to stand in one place doing the same thing your whole shift. Depending on the department you'll six day weeks consistently but the pay is good."
good,Company store is nice. Friendly people. Clean facility and good working environment. Helpful management. Provides adequate PPE. All in all I have enjoyed my employment at Tyson Foods.
good,"I do not suggest being part-time, benefits are better with full time. Does pay pretty well in my location. Working there the smell is horrible, but that is a plant for you. Keep to your self, employee can and will be very messy."
good,I enjoyed my time working at Tyson. An area of improvement is having effective management in place to ensure personal growth within the company. The last Manager in which I worked under was very ineffective and nonsupportive.
good,"Tough work environment.  We had to continually walk a fine line between meeting expectations promised to the customer, and the actual specs of what we shipped."
good,this is a great company to work for. at the time i worked there they was going through a management change.I would think that the company is running like clock work.
good,Gave me an opportunity to grow and advance in my work skills. Making new friends that I enjoyed working with and managers that  helped and taught me to excel.
good,Great people very respectful and they do their best to work with you but I wish they paid better like at least $2 more snow hour. They are rigorous with training and have a safety conscious stategy.
good,"very demanding physically and little time down to recover. The job I performed was very dusty and the physical demands were at times almost overwhelming. We only had baby chicks for 4 weeks until they reached about 2 pounds, then they were shipped to finisher farms where they would remain until 45 to 50 pounds and ready for market."
good,I enjoyed my job working here as a tub washer. I was responsible for cleaning the different staging areas in the warehouse. I liked my job very much but let due to illness and days missed.
good,"It’s a cold work environment, there’s many different types of work to do, some overtime is available for certain job titles, and there are opportunities to train in different job types and possibly move up in the company."
good,In a face pace work environment it can be stressful but Tyson Foods have a good management team that put a lot of effort in being professional. This is what stands out about this company.
good,I had an accident in my car and couldnt return to work for 10 days and i provided tyson all the papers possible but they said i didnt get it in in a Timely fashion i guess so then they came back with i was let go bc of probationary period
good,"Good company to work for"
good,Loved my job at tyson it was the best job ive ever had i had a nice truck but was let go when hurricane harvey tore it up i wish i still worked there ..
good,"I enjoyed my job and all the things that came with it. It can get stressful at times. Fast pace environment with temperatures below 30 degrees, but I worked on the side where it was hot and muggy"
good,"A normal work day involved just doing various jobs repetitively and rotating around during the day. I was usually dumping heavy tubs of chicken. I was not that good at it at first, but I got stronger and I got used to the load. The people there were friendly for the most part, but it is difficult to communicate on the work floor because of the loud machinery."
good,Plant facilities were very well kept. The supervisors were very helpful during training. When I had questions they were answered in a timely manor. I would work there again if given the opportunity.
good,"Decent place to work. Not recommended for those who are super sensitive to smells. Very diverse group. Long days and overtime. Decent pay, pretty good if you get a job with incentive."
good,"There are many ways to move up the ladder at tyson. the co workers made the day go by quick, fast paste and repettive.good benefits and good pay. If have to move and work hard to be comfortable in the cooler."
good,"Good, solid company with  high industry standards and values.  It's all on the job training and learn as you go which has it's up's and down.  TM's/workforce presented challenges that seemed more detrimental to success of plant and crews due to understanding success of business results in success of TM's."
good,"Fast paced but very satisfying work.  I managed a large crew 24/7 and most holidays."
good,"I'm a line lead their know I like it, it's just so cold. If it wasn't for that I don't see myself going anywhere else. Plus for me it's kind of long drive I'd like something closer where I live. The company as a whole is a great place."
good,Well I see that people who don't speak English.Have a hard time to learning the jobs they get.So seen I am a trainer and bilingual I dont get pay for it.
good,"dont forget to dress with layers the only downside working here is extremely cold temperatures, your get to take breaks as listes one 30 minute breaks and two 10 minute breaks. The most enjoyable part is interacting with others."
good,Good place to work. All though benefits are getting taken away. Lots of change going on because of all the companies being bought. Lots of culture shock on both sides of the aisle because of this.
good,"The job can be stressful if you work with the wrong people, but if you get a good team, you'll fly. Generally enjoyable work. Good opportunities for advancement."
good,Ótimo produto boa de se trabalhar e bom para novos conhecimentos
good,Very fast paced as everything is based on how many pounds are produced per labor hour.  Very safety conscious as safety is first priority.Have own medical staff on site.
good,It was an okay place to work. You do not get to have much life outside there when they are working 6-7 days a week. They pay decent and offer good health insurance. The work is not always hard but it is a place where you are going to WORK.
good,"Tyson's foods is the best place I have worked, and would have continued to do so bad I the opportunity. Hr, management, and policy's, to benifits, vacation policy,and u even get your birthday off with pay."
good,the day would start off by going to my locker to get my wet boots on and getting an apron and hair nets my job was to hang pepperoni sticks up and get them ready for the oven
good,Tyson Foods Inc. is a good place to work.  Everyone is friendly and easy to get along with.  Tyson Foods takes the time to do so many things for its team members.  They make sure to show just how much each person is appreciated.
good,very friendly and nice people but not a very hard working place but it can fast and cold sometimes depending on the department you will work in and some of the facilities could be ran better.
good,"a typical work day at Tyson is driving a forklift 12 hours picking and pulling pallets throughout the warehouse for production. I learned a variety of skill-sets on how to drive and maintain a successful percentage for production. Like how to use an RFK scanner, calculating the pick orders in between wrapping a pallet for completion so that i may use the best method on picking the upcoming pallet. I learned How to drive safe in a fast pace environment. I learned how to communicate effectively with others around me. The management always communicated before and after work discussing any news pertaining to Tyson foods inc. The workplace culture is very pleasing and comfortable. The hardest part of the job was working in the cold. the most enjoyable part of the job was being able to drive a forklift for the entire shift."
good,"i was so use to being lied to by the other trucking companies i drove for that when i came across tysons ,i couldnt tell honest truth from a lie, to any driver that reads this post tyson is the company to drive for thats my honest opinion."
good,Was a great experience to work with Tyson Foods. I met different people and gave an experience to work with other people. It was unfortunate that I have to leave that company for the need of the family.
good,loved working there except I had back problems and had to lift 50 lbs every 5 mins and standing long periods of time in the freezing cold cooler building
good,I started with Hillshire way before they bought it. It was Earthgrains and then Sara Lee Bakery group. Company was fantastic to work for. Great benefits but long hours.
good,If you're looking for a job that I'll get you in the door that has a lot of different opportunities to learn multiple different skills then Tyson is a good place for you depending on what jobs you do there depends on how much overtime you get but for me I've been there since February 2017 and I have moved up five different times learning different areas and in acquiring different certifications it is very easy to move up in the plant it's only you apply yourself and you show that you're a hard worker
good,"Tyson is an excellent company to work for.  However, they should invest more trust and support into their supervisors then the brand itself.  Tyson hire people from all walks of life, however when ever something threatens the brand or image, they cut ties without giving the supervisor do diligience"
good,"typical work day is pretty fast paced, I learned that there are good managed careers out there. Management was good with a chain of command. the work place culture was good people were easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job I would say was that they had extremely strict rules and you could get wrote up for minor infractions. The most enjoyable part of the job was a set schedule and constantley open advancements."
good,"Helpful and outgoing managers and supervisors. Always understanding. "
good,"never get to work 40 hours a week. some of the managers are racist , but regular employees are awesome . if management changes, and salary an hours are more , i will reconsider going back to tyson"
good,"Except for the good ole boy management at the small location that I was at, the company is a great place to work. I would go back to work for the company."
good,Overall good company. I gained a lot of experience and knowledge. Management was very caring and willing to work with you. Quality and production worked good together.
good,It wasn't a bad job i got a lot more experience in it and it also helped me catch up some fast stuff it wasn't so bad at all. i'm hoping that i get a better job that will force in it and to work fast.
good,Full time factory job worked most weekends. 10 attendance policy. Worked here almost 4 years. I left due to pregnancy that unexpectedly ended in miscarriage. Policy requires a year to re-apply.
good,From what I got out of the experience of working at Tyson Foods was that it was a very fast pace workplace and for that reason and had an extremely high turnover rate
good,"fast paced job, Attendance is a must. Management is productive, always working toward a goal. Workers are friendly & east to get along with. The hardest part of the job is adjusting to tempature"
good,i had lots of opportunity for advancement and was allowed to chose different avenues of activities. I think that they were one of the fairest employers that i have had over the last few years.
good,"This job was a breeze when everyone did their jobs. Some team members were not so motivated and complained a little too much. I think this was only because they simply didn't have the right outlook. The job itself with the right training was not bad. But, the risk for injury is very high and was hard on the body."
good,"On a normal day, I would lift/throw boxes (25-100 lbs) boxes, onto a conveyor belt. After two months I became company because they were impressed with my work. And was even aloud to run the line a couple of times."
good,It's been a awhile since I have been there. Though it was tough at the time due to the fact that I was young. You are constantly working and moving. There's lots of noise but once you settle in then it's not as bad.
good,Nothing I couldn't handle it was an ok environment not very good people to work with also a cold environment but it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be
good,Productive and fast-paced workplace. It has great management with caring personnel. Its goals are to have a positive safety culture that reduces hazards. The hardest part of the job is to unite the local concerns with the corporate oversight  initiatives. The most favorable part of the job is achieving the goals and reducing injuries.
good,I'm over load with work I don't have help when taking a vacation work twice as hard before and after vacations. Some people are nice to work with. I help a lot of people by ordering what they need.
good,Good company with opportunity and benefits. Pay is good. People are kind and actually talk to each other. Clean and has a nice break room. There is a lot of turn-around.
good,"Okay to work. Other than it closed down bosses were great. Everything was great. But it closed. Free food and exciting opportunities but then again, it's not open anymore"

Got an intestinal bacterial infection the first week I worked there and ended up in the emergency room.  Wished the management had told me to be more careful while working."
good,"Consistently working with knives and cutting the cheeks out of the hogs heads. A very bloody job. Though, the position could seem to be hard and dangerous working close to others while using sharp knives, all are required to follow all safety rules and guidelines."
good,"on a typical workday, it was all about maintaining a goal for production and orders. I learned that if we the company comes short of orders, cancel your day off plans. Management was fair, but often hard to get some questions answered while everyone is extremely busy completing their tasks for the shift. The hardest part of the job was location and what environment or department you were located in. the most enjoyable part of the job was staying within schedule from time to time."
good,"High expectations to perform.  Depending on the department, can be very stressful.  Benefits package changed to less desirable but overall acceptable."
good,I owe a lot to my experience working at the Randal Road Hatchery. I built a solid work ethic and great team building skills. Good place to start a career.
good,"It's an alright nob.if you work overnight  make sure you don't have any children ,this is a job especially for highscool graduates looking into getting in the warehouse work atmosphere."
good,It's a OK joB really bad working conditions and really hard on the body but it's not really a bad job if you can handle it alot of people  work there so it's can be crowded
good,"I worked here for almost a year, actually little shy of a year, the whole time was miserable due to the Plant manger not being the best. Besides that it trickled down to the lower manager like team leads etc. good money to work for but enviornment can be sliced with a butter knife."
good,this was a descent job that I did like but it was long hours and no time off. it is the same thing over and over in an assembly line and there is really no growth to be made in the company and they really do not care about their employees.
good,"dress to get messy and cold...i learned how to flip a 15 pund chicken onto hooks for 12 hours. Patience, management was fine but rules are rules. The workplace was very loud...the hardest part of the job was my hand mucles cramping up or not being able to feel my hands. Most enjoyable was sit be simple and the pay"
good,"Tyson is a good company to work for overall, but the inventory accounting department has poor management who do not follow company policy."

good,I would start the day with a safety meeting and then would go to stretching because it was such a strenuous job. The pay was awesome but it would take a lot out of me everyday.

good,I learned that if you want to have a good job with good money sometimes it comes with long hours and a lot of different attitudes.The hardest part was having a positive attitude with people who don't believe in you.
good,"I enjoyed working at Tyson the employees are much like family when  you work there. There are job postings all the time which give you the opportunity to learn several different jobs. Some are hot, cold, or dry environments. I had the opportunity to work throughout the plant and really loved working there. It is hard work and repetitive but if you are a hard working individual it will not bother you. The management are very good at solving problems and mostly easy going. The pay is good and with perfect attendance you are rewarded  with coupons to use in their store."
good,Cold and wet back the money ok the people were helpful and friendly. The bosses were fair it was a smelly job but someone has to do it but it was easy and they train you as well make sure you understand

good,we would start out on a daily meeting to touch base on what has happened that day and the management would send us to our designated job . then as he night went on i would get call after call to go fix something and i could never finish one thing because i could never have the time to finish then i would get in trouble by the other management because there was little done

good,"Bom ambiente de trabalho , ótimos benefícios."
good,The hardest part of the job is standing in a cold wet environment for eight to ten hours a day. The best part is the benefits and the vacation pay they award you after you have been there a year.

good,"Very productive job just not enough hours offered unless you have been with company for years . co-workers great to work with, management seem to change often with not knowing who is in charge or who to talk to if you have a issue or question about something."
good,"I enjoyed working here. As long as you pull your weight, people treat you great. The work isn't hard, but it's hard work. I had two injuries in the 3.5 months I worked there, and it cost me my job when I came back the second time. I had prior injuries though, so as long as you are careful, you'll be fine."
good,"Easy good money but not enough hours, good insurance and benefits.Great point system understanding supervisors. What i've learned about the job is the cleaning of the meat is important, co-workers is helpful. The hardest part of my job is making sure the people in front of me is doing their job right."

I learned how to organize a small group of team members to run product as efficient as possible while I was a crew lead, as well as how to fill out various forms of paperwork for tracking purposes and how to close work orders when we were finished with them.

good,"Being an assembler at Hillshire Brands is a great yet challenging job. As long as we follow the rules and the techniques that are established for us the day goes by smooth and productive.

Overall its a great place to work and make an honest living.

Throughout the day I would interact with all of my team members, answer any questions, and solve any problems that may occur. Management would have daily meetings to talk about ways to make the plant run more efficiantly. I greatly enjoyed working with the people on a daily basis, and the hardest part of my job was when the equiptment would break down. In my almost 4 years with the company I developed great people skills, learned to adapt to any work environment, and learned how to manage a large team smoothly."

I think my job is fair etc but I DO my job and come to work EVERYDAY. They've adjusted our point system a few times to be a little more lenient and forgiving for those whom need a little more than 6pts a year (not just illness.. weather etc) and too many people abused it.
good,It was a great experience  to work at. It was a learning experience being in  a work environment. The job has it's up and downs but all and all it was rewarding job

good,I gained a lot of knowledge working for the company.  I learned new jobs and grew within the company.  The hardest part of the job was not job duty i was going to do when i arrived at work.  A typical day at work was clocking in and heading to the supervisor office to log in and check the IRIS system.  I carried a radio and the department leaders would call to me when the changed a order and i would accurately enter the different bird sizes to meet every departments order that had to be produced.  I would then do one of my daily walk through around the plant checking for condensation or anything out of place.  I tried to stay a step ahead of usda inspections daily.  i would then return back to the office to check the IRIS systems and check the eye camera to make sure the birds were proper.  I would also help in the checking of the PAA levels and accurate temperatures of the chicken

good,Good place to work if you keep to yourself. Employees are very nosy and love gossip. Managers are nice but can be just as nosy. Willing to work around your schedule.  Are able to get overtime if needed.
good,I like to work there it is easy to me and I enjoy the work I do there and go to work I like to work there its work and money to make something to do to be working.
good,The job is very interesting and challenging. The workforce is constantly changing.The hardest part of the job is having time to complete everything in a workday. It is fast paced. Organization and adaptability are a necessity.
good,"stacked hams on racks for the most part unless we didn't have much to do that day then you get sent to another department. Management seemed really good at here, I never had a problem with it.

good,A typical day at work started at 4:25am getting equipment and paperwork set up and ready for the day. We worked as a team to get everything done as needed. Management was pretty fair to everyone. There were safety meetings and training sessions for many parts of the jobs. The hardest part of the job was when a machine would  break down and we had to wait for maintenance to come and fix it because we would freeze in the cold when we weren't busy.

good,"Long hours, but pay is good and I had nothing but respect for my upper management, who weren't afraid to work those same long hours and then some. Some of the green hat managers weren't that good, but they eventually get weeded out. The blue hats were mostly good managers and the plant manager, production manager and 99% of upper management onsite were great people. Advancement is certainly there if you want it. A few employees there were pretty shady people, but in a plant that size that's to be expected. There were a lot of great employees as well."

good,"Typical day at work involved looking after one another. Team Members made sure they were in a safe work environment. "
good,I enjoy the work at Tyson but it's hard on your body mainly your hands and back. Most people have back injuries and carpal tunnel from repetitive motions.

good,If someone is looking to move up in there career this is the place to work. The people around you like to share the knowledge they have to make you better at your job. and help you advance in your career
good,Fill positions when needed. Did many different jobs here. People are fun to work with even if everyone didn't speak the same language.
good,"harsh conditions, it is a cooler after all, but if you work you can dress for the temperature, decent benefit package, average pay rates, all in all not a bad company to work for."

good,"I enjoy everything about my job. The management is appreciative of you, and what you do at work. The most enjoyable part of the job is coming to work, and knowing what to expect. The co- workers are a little different because they're not really sociable, and every place i have worked at your job is your home away from home so everyone seems like family."
good,It was cold and wet. I just focused on my job. I hung 48 birds a minute out of 25 required. Poor management. Co-workers were lazy.
good,It was a nice place to work at.  They were very active in insuring employee safety and maintaining a clean safe work place. The people were great to work with and worked as a team to make sure things got done.
good,Everyday was a chance for opportunity at Hillshire. It is a fast paced job. very detailed oriented. always a chance to improve job status.

good,its was frustrating at times when people would not do the job right. my co-workers were amazing people i got along with them great.the hardest times would be coming back from breaks or lunch being stacked up with the meat.

Everyone gets in their assigned work stations. For the ones who may be absent, our supervisor may sometime rearrange our area location to perform other tasks that may need to be filled. We do this throughout the day and help each other out when necessary. We work 8-10 hour shifts occasionally depending on the department or what position we are assigned. We enjoy our day and communicate with each other well. if we have a problem, we know what to do about it and we have grown to the point where we can handle and manage certain situations ourselves. The hardest part of the day is when someone has a negative attitude and doesn't want to work or complains about everything.This is a typical work day for me.

Then prepare for outbound loads for the day. Recheck inventory levels against report from our storage facility and contact storage facility if any discrepancies were visible. Contact QA dept. to ensure any holds on products were released or would be to ensure no shortages or problems with orders. Once all was verified I would start to set up orders for the next week. I then would send the releases to cold storage facility for any product being picked up from there location and specify what was to be released. I at the same time would be doing preparing bills of lading for our own shipments from our plant. I would make calls to trucks lines as needed through out the day to ensure on time pick up and delivery of loads for next day. Help dock team members with any scanning issues as needed and did set up and print labels as well as scanning in return loads. My day would usually end by 4 PM.

As an operator, I acquired the skills of maintaining the raw to cooked weight of the product to produce the company's mandatory yield. In the same hand, this was the difficult part of the position, but I was able to produce the approved product temperature, weight, and yield.

good,The Tyson's that I worked at had an lot of brown noses and people that will throw you under the bus just to make them look better and for them to get out of trouble.

good,On my home line there were three stations that we rotate to every hour. Station one is where we trim the tails of the bellies and feed them into the production line. The machine will cut the belly into back strips and the ladies will weigh the bacon down the line. We practice safety and sanitary precautions while handling the bacon.

I enjoy the diversity and learning experience knowing that every day is going to be a little different."
good,"Its a typical day at work and I learn a lot of new stuff each and every day I work. It's not about going to work to make money, it's about making customers satisfied and getting the job done correctly.

Half way during my shift I would have a huddle meeting to talk about safety and what projects were coming up. I would have a daily meeting at 9:00 am with all production managers to talk about Downtime and any other issues thaey would on the floor. When that meeting was over I would bring back to the crew any concerns that was brought up. When all of that was over I would get caught up on my paperwork. At the end of my shift I would have a meeting with the second shift supervisor and pass any info from the day.
good,Learning to work in a cordial manner has enabled me to continually pride myself and make myself marketable to trying new experiences. These experiences have combined all into excellent customer service and satisfaction.

I also transferred inventory from one floor on the plant getting it to the supply all the while working in a time management environment. I learned how to multitask in a fast pace.  My fellow employee's came from different culture backgrounds and the hardest part of my job was I couldn't speak fluently in their language, so communication was a hard part of my job. The most enjoyable part of my job was learning about my co-worker culture & answering question for them in a helpful manner."

good,Tyson was the best plant I have ever worked for. It had the most professional staff and ergonomics we amazing.
good,I cleaned and sanitized machines every night for next day production. I would use a high powered water hose and various chemicals to clean and sanitize machines. My co-workers and supervisor were friendly and great people to work with. The hardest part of the job was working third shift.

good,Working at Tyson's was a great experience teamwork was always nessasary to get the job done. Friendly people and a great leading staff was always willing to help if needed.
good,Tyson is a good company.  They care about employees but their first concern is of course production.  The only issue with Tyson is work-life balance.  They are more than happy to let managers work 60+  hours per week but not hourly team members.
good,"A typical day at Tyson Foods is to come and set up your line, ensure your team members work safely, ensure product is safe and of good quality. I have learned to manage a production line and to take care of your people and they will take care of you. The hardest part about my job is dealing downtime. The most enjoyable part is working with adverse backgrounds."

good,Working at Sanderson Farms I had to work on the line as it was moving straighting out tenders as they enter the fryer into the freezer. After the freezer there was packout as they was sent out in bags and boxes packed.The hardest part was filling in for a person and not knowing what exactly what to. The best part of that was I am easy to catch on. The enjoyable of the job I could most do anything that was in front of me to do. I had co-workers that was willingly to work with me under no circumstances.
good,"Although it had great pay, it wasn't always the most pleasant."
good,"i loved working with this company, made great money, you get to meet alot of nice people, and go different places"

good,Very laid back well as much as they can be. Quiet place with my three months never ran out or I could go back loved working there. The co workers would help as much as they could and you will always have that one that try’s to make you miserable. Other then that a wonderful place to work
good,Great company and benefits but they do not care about their employees. Management is just as childish as the employees and show favoritism. Will give you a point or fire you for anything
good,The cold temperatures and the constant work made the day go by. Tyson would be a place that I would consider going back to work. The supervisors were usually fair and always making sure the team members were ok
good,Everyone there loves me there very easy work and it’s all about team about team work  we always come together we talk about what needs to be done I love it great pay there
good,"It was a decent paying job, some people were nice and others weren’t. Would change up the schedule on the day we worked. If we were scheduled to work 6:52am-4pm we would be told at 3 that we have to stay till 5:30 even though lots of people live an hour away."
good,"I really enjoyed my job, good start up in the industry.,good job, good benefits and good people, management not easy to get to advance and not easy to get raise."
good,"Long work days but good pay for what you do. "
good,At Tyson you learn a lot about food handling and sanitation. The management is amazing and they can always get you what you need.The hardest part of this job was all the heavy lifting continuously for hours at a time.
good,The job isn’t hard hard just the management could be a little better in my opinion but other than that it’s a good job with good benefits the pay is okay with overtime I think but I can’t make it by with the hours cut short

good,I have worked for a better company.I can honestly say they treat the employee as if they are family . I can member all the help and apperication given is far beyond most employers.
good,This is great strong company work for an chances to move up and learn this company treats you like family and long you showed up for work you had job and this company would understand if you had personal business take care of it overall amazing company
good,"I liked my job, but I had an issue with one of my supervisors. If I had not had continued or prolonged personal issues with my supervisor I would have stayed at Tyson Foods"
good,"Great job, great pay, long hours, difficult staff in the nursing department that I was not able to deal with, would go through HR. Had to answer to Nursing and HR and plant manager. Upper management often did not want accidents reported as recordables to OSHA. Very stressful environment."
good,"I also loved working here! It was 12/13 hour days but you work so fast it went by fast, i loved getting the job done on time, i liked the people who i worked aroumd they have great attitudes amd everyone helps everyone. One day youll be on assembly line grading/imspecting chicken and one day youll be boxing chicken. Loved it!"
good,Have to be able to deal with the freezer every one most likely get a long.  Sometimes it can really be a stress dealing with the point system.  Over all its a great company but I think better for felons
good,Hard work consistent good to work with coworkers lot of opportunities smelly at times convenient they also provide transportation the environment is healthy serve good food
good,"Work days were always filled with tasks to work on or meetings. Certain times of there year, there was lots of overtime and weekend work. More than I would like because it made the work/home life not balanced. I enjoyed meeting new people from different groups and working together on projects. Depending on what office you work at, depends on the culture you experience. Some places are better than others. Upper management was great when I worked there, but recently everything is changing. There are good and bad apples in middle management, and you wouldn't know until you started working there and learned."
good,"I like Tuesday  night work because that is the beginning day of my week. I have learned how to do the grotes PM, rebuild pumps, fix tux machine, multivac, video jet, microwave, air compressor, use a plasma cutter."
good,"Tyson food plant taught me alot and because of them , they played a big part in my life of getting into college making me realise how hard life could be without a college education."

good,"every day at work was different. Even though my job title was master pack, i took on many other responsibilities. Some of which include looking after someone's shift, working in different parts of the plant when needed. Most of my co-workers were easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job was having to work the graveyard shift, the most enjoyable part of the job was the people i worked for and pay day. :)"

good,"Tyson is a great place to work just not for me. Great managers, great people. If you have young kids I wouldn’t bother working during the night shift."
good,I liked working with Tyson though the area I worked you normally worked 6-7 days a week.  The pay is great but it is like mandatory work for the most part.

good,"Its long and ti-teas. Its hard on your hands and and feet. They need to work on rotating people on each line. (each dept.) It then would make the night go faster and your hands would hold out longer.  Enjoy the rotation part of the job. You get to learn the whole line or the area your working.  Not all lines and dept. do this. They need two 30 min breaks like they had once before. Were not machines. I like team work, when everybody would come in, we work well."
good,"Could be a fun work place, but it lacks supportive management. it was all about the numbers. Decent amount of red tape, all politics, but at this facility this was the norm."
good,"Packed chicken wings in tray,producing from 500-1,000 packs daily ,performed work from written procedures,verbal instruction,and visual diagrams,weighed boxes of packed chicken to ensure proper weight for shipment"
good,"Tyson is a great place to work. The people become a family the longer you work there. Consistency is a great reason to work here. A forty-hour week is almost always guaranteed. The work is hard, but the pay is good. This is a great place to advance and being a hard worker pays off. The management and co-workers all work together as a team to get production done each and every day. Since this is a production type of job doing the same thing consistently everyday can be hard on your body."
good,enjoyed everything about this job. the customer to the management team

good,"A typical day at work with this company is very challenging, but at the same time fun. This job was all about repetition, all team members have to make sure they are safe and ready to work on the line, cutting, de-boning, bagging, and boxing. What i have learned from management here are different ways of communication to team members, and other staff, how to be an effective supervisor, and to gain the trust and respect from employees. The hardest part about this job would have been the process of qualification, after then everything got a little easier. The most enjoyable part of this job was the challenge, to know that every day i had accomplished so much."
good,"nothing too special, very fast-paced as well. Never got bored or ran out of things to do."
good,"We had to work long hours all the time, very hot environment. We kept the production line running smoothly with bread and buns and Gerber baby toast running efficiently. the hardest part of the job is when machinery broke down and had to wait to continue  to finish the project."
good,"Long nights so 12 hour shifts from 5pm-5am, very hot. I learned how to work with other while training new employees. No management. Co-workers were great, we all worked together to get the job done in a timely manner while following rules. The hardest part was staying awake after being at school most of the day, then going back to work. The best part of the job was the pay and benefits that were available."
good,"excelent place to work, but no job security, even after almost 28 years."
good,A typical day will start 6am Every morning conduct meetings to to dicuss goals for the day. The Manager that we worked for was able to care for us as workers and directed us very well and was a pleasure to work for and under.

good,"Tyson Foods is a great way to take care of your family, Its hard work. You will miss out on a lot of things due to working long hour, but sometimes you have to take the good with the bad. While at tyson i learned to do everything by hand and its veryhard but im proud that i can do those things. It taught me hard work. The work place it self can be stressful because of the people do your work get your money and go home.The pay check every week is worth the work. The benifits are great the mangers and leads will help you if you ask. I think that their rehire rule is unfair for the people who have not been to tyson more than three times when the plant needs so much help why not Get the people who havent been up there 3 times who knows what their doing to get this production out on time"
good,A typical day would be fun cause your working the culture was amazing all different races worked there and everyone seemed to get alone the hardest part of the job was when we fell behind and had to work to catch up.

Completes reports by entering required information."
good,"In a typical work day, I had the flexibility to plan out my objectives and goals for the week while working independently, but with coordination with plant nurse and collaboration with management team.  I worked side by side with employees on the plant floor of a chicken food processing plant.  I worked all 3 shifts to determine consistent processes, training, safe workstations and procedures.  I analyzed the work steps and wrote job descriptions for the nurse review.  I suggested ergonomic improvements to reduce or eliminate injuries.  After my senior year graduation, I elected to stay on and complete the same project at another plant at the request of the customer.  I thoroughly enjoyed this experience and wanted to find permanent work in another plant environment."
good,"Aprendi várias coisas nessa empresa, fiz muitas amizades"

good,Hillshire was also a great place to work unfortunately I was laid off the company made changes and I was fairly new employed and I was one of many who had to leave
good,Tyson Foods is a great place to work and advance in your career. The only thing that I have a problem with is poor Management. If they spend more time thinking and doing there job correctly then they wouldn't have a high turnover like they do.
good,"They work you hard, even some Saturday's you might have to come in. But you'll have Sunday off and pick back up for work Monday. You making $10.00 starting off after your 90days you'll make about $11-$12 a hr."

good,Everyday it was a different task for me other than answering phone calls or taking orders from my supervisor. I learned what it's like to run a company that has so any orders to send to different super markets. My co-workers were really nice to me i never had any problems with anybody and it's always about team work and getting things done on time. The most enjoyable part was getting everyone together when the company had allow us to have a special lunch with good food or getting free trips to concerts and places.

Learned you can't always please everybody and you can't always work with everybobdy. Putting forth the effort and forgetting difference and you'e there to do a job, makes all the difference in the world. Team effort and team support is a number one character to have. To be able to come in happy and leave happy is a very great thing. We do our jobs but are able to help somone else if our line goes down."

As a supervisor i was responsible for everything at any givin time and they have no problem replacing managers. Overall I loved the job and my team. Id go back in a second.
good,A typical day at Tyson was fast-paced and you would have to work hard. It was easy work once you caught on to the work you were doing. In some departments you could sit down and work. The management was very understandable with alot of things.

good,I love Tysons. They are family oriented and always put employee safety first. They are fair and understanding. The only drawback they aren't competitive in pay. They have lost a lot of employees due to pay.
good,"The legacy SIM ERP System was great to support and maintain. It provided a lot of opportunities to work with the business, understand/analysis their needs and develop solutions. Once the system was replaced, the new SAP Solution is not as flexible. Therefore, limiting the interaction with the business unless there is a problem and in those cases, it is a training issue."

good,A typical work day at Tyson's for me consists of knowing how to multi-task and knowledge of all machines. Management is really cooperative and able to accommodate needs of each teammate. The hardest part is when the machines break down and loosing production time as a result of.
good,The area I was working at when i first started was perfect unroll they began moving me all over the place which had me off aanaced on how to do certain things. Some of the managers here are horrible.

Your supervisor checks on each employee as much as he or she can and also gets involved with the work, everyday from what I seen."
good,"From mixing the doughs to packing the granola bars to shipping out the orders, everyone has to work in the highest standards possible. You are responsible for the product that you produce.

My manger is great he wanted everything in order and done in a timely manner. The Hardest part of my job was cleaning the ceilings because the lifts would be on uneven land.

I was able to cut my 800 and more on a daily basis so I made very good money, proud of myself for that! Actually cutting all day standing in one spot was the hardest part of the job, because standing in one spot and cutting all day everyday can really get to you, hurting your back and your hands. I really enjoyed my time there though because they told me I had the 3 A's, attitude attendance and ability, to go places there, so they trained me in all areas of the department and I became a temporary lead for 7 months, which is kind of like a ""boss"" over a certain line or department."

Loved going in doing my job and going home I loved not having to worry about anything else but my job and when my shift was over going home. Hours were perfect for me.

The reason the workplace culture is awesome is because you work around all types of people.

good,"Setting priorities for specific duties if needed. Working in a team and individual environment. Collaborating with vendors and internal staff to create a caring, committed and confident solution for all needs. I worked with several groups within the company to help enhance the value of it's team members through diversity and inclusion. My job was a standard routine that could become stagnant if not for the ability to engage with other employees. The company has a very family oriented and growth intended environment. We had activities through business resource groups that kept thing fun and uplifting as well as classes to train and better ourselves and our performances."

good,"Loved working there! Enjoyed my co workers, managers were easy to work for and respected my time and my efforts in the work enviornment.  Flexible schedule ."
good,"Be an adult, be treated as an adult. If management observed an employee joking around and not acting as a mature adult they won’t consider you for advancement. The plant I work for seems to appreciate hard work and people who take their job to heart. Advancement can come very quickly as long as you are at work on time every day, take the required time for break and no longer, and don’t call out. Tyson offers a very generous amount of call in points (14). 1 point will fall off as long as you are on time, don’t leave early, and don’t call in for 30 consecutive days. The work can be very strenuous on your body. However, if you listen to your trainers and do the job the exact way you are trained how, you will have no problem. Generally the proper way to preform the job is painful at first, due to the use of muscles in the body that we don’t typically use. This pain will go away within a few weeks."
good,While working for tyson I fix machines that break down. i learned how to fix the equipment. To me management was organized and well put together when it comes to their employes. the hardest part of the job was fixing thing that were new to me. the thing that i enjoyed the most was learning how to fix new things.

good,"If you understand you are working in a food production environment, or have before you will do great here. Of course sanitation and safety are of utmost importance, so you will have safety procedures and rules to follow and will have to wear safety equipment. Also you will have to follow sanitary rules and guidelines and wear sanitized gear and hairnets, etc. You are working with the food that we all eat. The jobs can be easy, repetitive or more complicated and technical but everyone is on their feet all day, it can be cold or hot depending on the floor and weather. If you cant handle meat/blood or working in cold/hot this might not be for you. It is a hugely diverse workgroup, but we all seemed to pull together very well and made a great supportive team. I miss that a lot. Ive worked in many other places since Tyson, and no one compares. I always end up comparing them to Tyson. From HR to QA to Management to regular employees, everyone just seems to be in it together sort of attitude.

One thing I learned about working here was that if you didn't clean the machines and merchandise after every use, that they can cause a very strong odor through out the work place.

good,"Una empresa como Tyson Foods, con presencia mundial, en donde el ambiente de trabajo es muy profesional a todos los niveles. Se trabaja con un nivel importante de stress pero vale la pena para poner en el mercado productos alimenticios derivados de la carne de pollo, res y cerdo asi como otros productos, con la mas alta calidad. Cada gerente tiene bien claro su rol de trabajo como parte de una familia, representar a la marca 24/7 (las 24 horas del dia, los 7 dias de la semana), es un privilegio que pocos se dan el gusto de haberlo vivido. Tratar a cada trabajador con dignidad y respeto y comunicar con claridad las metas de produccion, no es tarea facil, sobretodo cuando se trabaja con personas de diferentes nacionalidades donde para comunicarse se necesita de una persona como traductor (personas que no hablan espanol o ingles). La parte mas dificil fue dejar el trabajo por no haber un cupo para el primer turno. Trabajar  de 5pm a 5am, aunque solo 4 dias por semama fue demandante fisicamente pero muy gratificante."

good,Great maintenance team of over 100 techs. Good place to learn and grow with tuition reimbursement. Very friendly team to work with. One of the things that I noticed is how accepting the workforce is to new employees. Great Place but cold in most areas at 38 degrees
good,Tyson is a great company to work for. I was basically processing invoices from buyers and vendors. Going over the invoices and finding errors and adjusting payments.
good,"I worked for almost 6yrs and i had a pleasant work experience,the company has real good benefits and incentives,my overall work experience was great, and the company feeds on the holidays"
good,"Working at Tyson was like having a second family.  They offered several in depth training programs to gain knowledge.  Unfortunately, after the plant manager retired the atmosphere changed immensly, most of my long time co workers pursued other opportunities.  The hardest part of the job would have had to be all the issues caused by the wash down crew, i.e. machines don't like 140 degree high pressure hot water and bleach.  Also, a lot of equipment would get damaged or have parts lost in the process.  However, I always have enjoyed a challenge!!!"
