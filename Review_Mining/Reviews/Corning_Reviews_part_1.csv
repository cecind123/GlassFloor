rating,review
bad,"Starting pay 12.50 "
bad,I witnessed plant mgr tell temp April 2019 not to take test at home anymore . She told him mgmt will help him throughout exam to get into the company.
bad,"Environment  emotionally draining "
bad,"You will get fired for anything, even something someone arbitrarily says you did. The overtime is terrible, and the management will hunt reasons to fire."
bad,Good company and good culture place to work and learn more new technologies with improving skills and encouraging people around to learn more. This company has a good culture.
bad,"You can jump through hoops and solve major problems, but a contractor rarely makes the jump to permanent employee. It is extremely frustrating, especially if you are more than qualified for your position (i.e. education level, experience, etc.) and work hard every day. If this is the case, the problems you solve will be credited to your supervisor or another permanent employee in your department, instead of you."
bad,Have worked with Corning Inc. since 1979. Excellent people to work with. Projects are always unique and exciting. Some key features about my work is the ability to work at home.
bad,"unless someone took you under their wing, you didn't have a chance, very competitive, fast paced, you never knew from one day to the next if you had a job or not...business had slowed at the time, they laid a lot of us off at one time..they were bad for that.."
bad,I spent 15 years working for Corning and when I first started the company culture was all about taking care of its people. And over the course of my career Corning experienced a drastic downturn with its culture in that it no longer could afford to take care of its people. Generic job titles allow HR to underpay their employees is the game there.
bad,"Corning wants ""The Best"", but they are only willing to pay the average for your service. Merit increases are very poor (1-2%, lower than inflation) despite $1B+ annual corporate profit numbers and cash-on-hand of over $3B. Upper management is removed from day-to-day happenings on the floor and doesn't recognize a valuable employee from a problem employee. Cronyism is RAMPANT and blatant. If you are not someones favorite, expect to never get a good raise/promotion/review. Depite the poor raises, management expects 50-60 hrs/week plus ~1 weekend/month. Work/life balance is NOT good. If you live to work, this is your place. If you work to live, Corning will chew you up and spit you out. The ideal exempt employee is someone right out of school with no prior knowledge of how any other company goes about its business and treats employees. If you are mid-career, expect to be disappointed in how you are treated."
bad,"Worked for the company for a year. Worked in Microwave CNC area. Supervisor didnt care for you at all. Only cared for himself. Micromanage his employees, has favorites, and doesn't lead by example."
bad,Empresa com alta rotatividade de funcionários o que acaba acarretando instabilidade ao profissional que trabalha na empresa.
bad,"This company is the most disrespectful and unfeeling I have ever worked for."
bad,"not a stable job, they layoff a lot, no time for  family. Very numbers oriented, even over safety. Pay is good, but you cannot count on it being there for long."
bad,"My husband was let go, 5 days shy of being their 6 months. He wasnt given a good reason, except he wasnt available enough. He had just worked 4 days, for various employees needing off. They didnt fire him to his face either. They waited until he got off work, one morning to call him and tell him, he was fired. 2 months later, he found out that nearly every single person hired, around the same time was fired too. My husbands immediate supervisor was unaware, he was going to be fired. He was just notified that my husband would not be returning. My husband has ALWAYS had an exemplary performance record."
bad,"I've only seen and worked at one manufacturing plant that Corning owns, so my view is probably not indicative of the company culture at the headquarters. That said..."
bad,"I preferred not to answer this question.  I did not have a good experience as an intern, however I cannot say that my experience is a common one.  I have not spoke to enough people that have been in similar positions."
bad,"Corning is no place to work, I would definitely NOT recommend it. They tell you you will work 12 hours a day, wrong, sometimes 16 or more and you dont have a choice. If you miss anymore than 4 days per year they will fire you or if you make any tiny mistake they will fire you, no questions asked and your so called union will NOT fight for you."
bad,"Management is lacking skill set to deal with employees. Also, operations manager is way too young to be in his position.  Ribbon manager is a complete uneducated moron."
bad,"This is a terrible place to work. 60 hours every week, 12 hour days. Management only cares about lining their pockets. No work/life balance. Pay is excellent. Benefits are good. Not appreciated for your work and you're only a number."
bad,"The company is presented to you as a pristine work environment where everyone is happy, advances easily, and has everything they could ever want from a job. In the interview process, there is a continuous stress that Corning is the best possible place to work. As I new graduate, I believed it--they offer a flashy relocation assistance check and high salary."
bad,The Vineland branch is horrible. I would not wish the job on my worst enemy. They tell you you can choose 4 or 8 hours OT but the foreman always make you work 8 because “we don’t need you for 4 hours.” People constantly call out and it puts a strain on the new people because they get put in their positions. They say they’re hiring you for “service crew” but they give you 2 weeks of training and throw you right on a machine as a machine operator. They lie horribly in the interview and tell you you get paid holidays off but really you have to work them. You can’t even use a vacation day because it’s a “blackout” holiday. I could go on and on but this place is absolutely horrible to work at. You have no work/life balanave. All you do is work and they treat you like a dog.
bad,"Little training and large quotas to meet. Long hours, 12 hour work days with mandated overtime.  United Steelworker Union that was worthless and did not represent new employees."
bad,Worked on integrating multiple sites with central NA cluster
bad,"Only enjoyable thing were some of the people you'd work with. Management was awful, shifts were long, I was paid poorly, no good benefits, negative atmosphere."
bad,"The job was great at first, but they do not treat their employees well at all. I stayed a temp. For the 2 years I worked there. The full time employees treated the temps awful"
bad,"Do not recommend going there! New DON is not for the employee's! She is mean and miserable. Does not listen and will fire you for no reason! I was in management while I was there the co-workers loved me, as I would help out. The DON on the other hand did not and refused to!"
bad,This is the kind of job where you go to die. After a couple weeks of working here the overwhelming amount of sadness and depression across all floor workers becomes apart of you. The people working here have given up on their dreams and ambitions. They give you a decent paycheck for your soul it seems like. Management treats all floor workers like lesser people and has no respect for the work being done. Ill never support this company again.
bad,"Decent place to work and raise a family off the wages. The commute  to work was not that bad at all. The company has changed plant managers 4-5 times in eight years, so the culture is in an uproar, no consistency."
bad,Not an environment conducive to team work. Strong disconnect between the administrators and the production staff.
bad,Not family friendly.  Dont care about you just wants product out. Constantly pushing you till you have a break down. Wants you to learn all kinds of things but dont want to give you more pay. Management is very corrupt. Management has no clue how anything or how long something is done. Just not a happy place to work
bad,tuve una muy mala experiencia en el ámbito  laboral no pagan conforme lo acordado por ultimo la administración es muy mala solo contratan a personas que no tiene experiencia...
bad,There is no room for growth and there is no room for errors. They are very bias about who they hire and fire.They need to have a public relation department set up for temps as well as the employee they do choice to hire in this company.
bad,"if you are a 20 year old pretty female who works out everyday they will love you, otherwise you will be treated like a second class citizen and thrown out like yesterday's trash. This only applies to the customer service department. The other departments were much more friendly and welcoming but customer service is very outdated and do not involve the ""team"" in any decision making. I was called at 7pm and informed I could not come back to work the next day and the supervisor told my team that I had quit and left them hanging. This was after 2 years of working without asking for one day off since I did not get paid vacation time at all. I loved my coworkers but management needs to get with the times, this is 2015 after all."
bad,"They say they care about employees. But when they overspend and don’t keep up with current specifications so they don’t reach their goals. They lay off all the workers that met their goals for production. But keep the executives and management that made did not. Personally I had to deal with a couple of bullies, not surprising they keep bullies also"
bad,"Incredibly cliquey - if you're not one of the boys, there appears to be no chance of surviving at the job."
bad,"Management was poor, inept and played favorites. Office politics mean more than doing any actual work, and people are rarely held accountable for poor performance. If you can suffer in silence then this place is for you."
bad,unfortunately this was only a temporary position that lasted two months the hours were not suitable for me and my family never really got to know any one
bad,"A typical day consists of troubleshooting problems."
bad,"Corning is one of the world’s leading innovators in materials science. For more than 160 years, Corning has applied its unparalleled expertise in specialty glass, ceramics, and optical physics to develop products that have created new industries and transformed"
bad,"You may work 8-12 hour shifts depending on the demands for our products.  I learned how to handle various machines and general operations of the machines, packaging products, inspecting products.  Enjoyed working with my co-workers worked very well as a team member. The hardest part of the job was not knowing if you were working an 8 or 12 hour shift.  Being mandated to work regardless of what you had planned for your days off and missing time with your family and friends.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the friendships I built with my co-workers."
bad,Corning works a rotating 12 hour shift rotation.  There is a lot of mandatory overtime.  You know your schedule a year in advance but you can't schedule vacation or plans on your days off because you dont know what overtime may come up.
bad,"Corning was once a good company to work for, however, they do not appreciate many of their employees who are not of Supervisory role or above.  Forced to work mandatory overtime regardless of family commitments/needs.  Pay scale is inadequate as many of the new hires are getting paid close to those who have worked there for many years."
bad,"the actual job was fun, the area surrounding the job was a battlefield of broken egos' and revengeful middle aged has bens, management filled with me,me, me attitudes."
bad,in the machine shop in keene nh they only hire temp to perm.  They will lead you to believe the position is first shift but when it comes to hiring you they say they only have 2nd shift available!
bad,"Typical workload is around 60hrs/week and you are never compensated for that. Management looks down on people. Getting yelled at is ordinary thing in a typical day."
bad,"My typical workday included handling Service requests related to Active Directory Account and Group Management, creating and managing file shares, exchange accounts, etc."
bad,"Rather not comment"
bad,"This company prides themselves on ""valuing the individual"" however, the work life balance and the limited advancement opportunities are appalling. Even the competitive salary becomes minimal due to the excessive uncompensated overtime hours worked. 65-70 hours per week at times."
bad,"I was shuffled around without a real on boarding process, There was very little communication with me about my role and I was left to figure things out mostly on my own."
bad,I enjoyed working at Corning Inc but after 3 years of employment they canceled my contract without warning after altering my entire team structure and promising my position was safe.
bad,Management does not give any slack when it comes to missing time during your 90 day probation. Even a dead relative is no exception. Poor understanding of human decency.
bad,7 day swing shift will consume your life. On top of that there is mandatory overtime or discipline. They pay well but its like selling your soul for money.
bad,"Fun, challenging and the supervisor is very professional. I have learned a lot assembling and fixing electrical issues. but is not a team work environment with some  people"
bad,me parece una buena empresa pero le falta mas compromiso de parte de algunos trabajadores con la empresa.
bad,"Severely micromanaged with no appreciation for the worker. The pay is also not enough for the amount of work that is given. No matter how hard you work it is never good enough. People are overworked, and weekends are surprisingly sprung on without any notice."
bad,"Management disorganized and over rated projected group was hired for, resulting in released of contract employees and down size operation from 4 shifts to one."
good,Never go through Adecco terrible hiring agents to work within such a great company! Not there for the employees and families. they just want there cut of Corning money
good,"The people in that place are pretty cool ! But it is very cliquey! There’s always so much work and not enough employees, they do not care they expect you to figure out a way to get it don’t and when you don’t get it done they ask questions they they already know the answer to there’s simply not enough people! Manufacturing has it the worst and they pay them the worst ! The folks in the office thank there smarter then everyone because they have degrees but they really don’t know anything about what we go through on the manufacturing side !"
good,Typical work day is when I would get a assignment and would be responsible to complete the assignment.  Challenges are when it's a new issue that tech are unaware of and takes longer than anticipated to complete it
good,"Corning as a company supports diversity and a healthy work life balance.  With that said the IT workplace culture needs much improvement.  "
good,Sentimos explorados pela empresa que não oferece benefícios
good,Nice rural setting. Culture moving in a different direction. Outsourced model. Many long time employees have left the company.
good,"It may be a good company for dual candidates, diversity candidates but definitely not for mid-career hires. Found it to be not doing what they preach on a daily basis. Poor management, utter lack of communication and extremely click-y company. One has to know people inside to be able to weather storms that comes once every three years-head count reductions. Very little chance to prove ones intellectual abilities as folks are moving project to project all the time. Due to lack of any in-depth subject matter expertise often it is difficult to get the next job if one is booted out of Corning."
good,"Generally, I liked the work a lot and there were many great people there.  The work place culture was quite difficult to navigate because middle management was out of control.  Got involved with a supervisor who was out to rise through the politics, despite how many 'dead bodies'.  The competent technical people in my group all transferred out to new groups or they left the company entirely.  Upper level management does not get involved.  Keep your cards close to your chest, because there are many that will take credit for your work / or they will try to covertly subvert your projects if they compete with their own.  Honestly, I don't know why some people behave that way because it's really bad for the company.  People compete with each other in ways that are not ethical."
good,"Not really able to utilize your skills in a functional way, management knows better even thou they have never done the job!"
good,"leadership does not seem to know where the company is going, lot of politics needed to succeed, no opportunity for advancement as an operator, must relocate to succeed."
good,"The Corning corporation is a great company to work for with very good benefits however the culture at the Tewksbury MA location has changed as a result of some key management changes there is no longer a work life balance. If you are prepared to work long hours this is for you, otherwise look elsewhere."
good,"Lack of career advancement opportunities.  Lack of proper staffing resulting in a heavy workload."
good,The company culture is great and the inclusion for the employees is outstanding but if you are a contractor you are excluded from all the perks and benefits. It is very hard to get hired unless you have friends or family who help you to get a job. The pay is not fair for contractors since every staffing agency offers different rates and benefits and the gap can be enormous while you are performing the same job duties in the department.
good,"L'entreprise corning à une fermeture programmée"
good,"Its a great place to work, but being hired on permanently is very hard. People have worked with Corning as temps for years and still cant seem to get a permanent position, despite doing a very good job in the work place."
good,"Was threw a temp agency, tried to get in threw Corning but they don't do that anymore, made $9.79 hr and CEO makes 13 million!!! Treated like slaves and people above you make u feel like you are nothing. Only got a .30 cent raise in two years !!! Doesn't offer any benefits,"
good,"Great place to work, however currently in a downswing.  Corning has an amazing culture, and I respect them entirely.  The issue is in 2020 IT is going through a drastic change.  Expect layoffs."
good,"Management was too busy in meetings to really be there and help. Extremely  bad on communication "
good,Everyone is working around 60 hours/week. No family life. Also many are forced to work straight night shift for 12 hours. I enjoyed Corning a lot at first. Then they started hiring lazy people who didn't want to work and it made it hard on others who had to pick up the slack. Nothing was ever done with these people who just hung out for 12 hours.
good,Corning purchased Mediatech and decided to eliminate majority of existing staff replacing with less skilled younger staff @ more competitive salaries. Typical takeover resulting from a fortune 50 company over a more family oriented company atmosphere. Neither good or bad just depending if one prefers the latter option.
good,"no dan equipo de protección personal  "
good,Swing shifts and no weekends family isn’t important to Corning they care about numbers above safety . You will work around harmful chemicals and dust .
good,En el área de ensamble mi obligación es de ensamblar diferente modelos de gabinetes para sistemas. Lo primero es hacer el mantenimiento autónomo que es checar mi mesa mi equipo y otras cosas con que trabajo.Es inportante usar el (epp)el equipo de protección personal.Cuando todo esta listo y seguro reviso mis ordenes y verifico checando el (print) que modelos de                    (assy Cabinets) van a salir ese dia. Al terminar de revisar me dirijo a  gaula para pedir los remaches y otros componentes que lleva el gabinete. Cuando tengo todo para completar una orden empiezo a ensamblar todas las piezas de una sola orden. Al terminar lo mando a soldadura para que lo puedan solder.
good,"Enjoy working for Corning Inc. The hardest part of the job is there is no movement. Enjoyable part of the job is establishing relationships with your customers, this is satisfying, feeling valued and appreciated."
good,My first contract job.  It was a good learning experience.  Made so good friends there.  It as during the fiber optics boom so it was very fast paced.  Liked working with fiber gain amplifiers.
good,"Durch die Conti-schicht bleibt leider dass Privat- oder Familien- leben arg auf der Strecke.... Allerdings kann man durch die ganzen Zuschüsse und Zulagen sehr gutes Geld verdienen!!!"
good,"It takes awhile for someone to get hired on. Once hired on the salary and benefits are great. You have to be able to stand for 12 hrs., and you have two paid 30 minute breaks."
good,"I enjoyed my job but people were very clicky. If you didn't get into the position from a referral or hired permanently they would ignore you until you got the ""white badge (permanent)"". Some people could get away with murder while others who were actually working got in trouble for everything. My manager was extremely intelligent but she didn't know how to lead. She could come across as extremely offensive and not realize it."
good,"A typical day start at 11pm and ends at 7 am. I was in charge of producing bio-medical items, test sample for conformity, wrap them and stock. Call maintenance team every time machine broke down."
good,"They have team leaders and managers' poor communicator between management.  They will micromanage every order and keystroke. "
good,"A typical day at work is setting the line up, making sure everything is in tact so the line can run a good cable. I've learned how to set up a line and operate as well while just being a temp. Management is it rough the edges as supervisor and coordinator hoover over their employees like children. The workplace is sometimes messy as a lot of people look to get you fired. The hardest part about the job is trying not to fall asleep. The most enjoyable part is the days off."
good,"Equipment is running 24/7, sometime difficult to work around but quick pace when equipment does go down, did enjoy working with the people I met. Learned a considerable amount from Corning during my time."
good,"I worked at 2 different consumer product plants and eventually at the corporate data center. At the plant level you were given a lot of responsibility and really felt like you were doing something important."
good,"corning has changed in past 5 years. not for the better.morale is very low,and people are leaving for different jobs.you do not feel appreciated at all.they are way down in employees, word is, corning has bad reputation on outside.they do not pay well, and you have to run multiple machines. they expect you to do perfect work while running fast pace,and multiple machines.management wont listen,so people aree leaving. used to be a great company, now they are lacking from leadership."
good,I enjoyed my time at this company.  I enjoyed the comradery with my former colleagues.  I learnt a lot from the several projects that I worked on.  The overall work environment can be improved significantly to boost employee morale.
good,"The company has interesting and challenging projects to work on.  Process is king in this company so if youre a process engineer its a great environment."
good,Established company with long work days often 12 hour days and lots of weekend work.
good,The workplace culture is unique at Corning. The company offers plenty of tailored learning experiences. This is an ideal company for those entering the workforce and looking to remain with one company for the duration of their career.
good,"Try to advance - management tells you what you want to hear to make you happy at the time."
good,"I was looking forward to working at Corning until it came to the actual job.  Maybe it was just me, but I felt the work load was a bit much trying to keep up with multiple machines."
good,Working the 7 day swing shift was very difficult to juggle a family life. There were a lot of benefits to take advantage of. I did enjoy receiving a Goal Sharing Check every year.
good,"Buena empresa muy estable con mucho trabajo y aprendi aqui ingenieria , mis colegas son muy profesionales"
good,"nice place to work, people were very positive and full of energy. One of the worlds top leaders in fiber optic creations."
good,Learned a lot over the years and yes there were guidelines that were followed but outstanding group of people to work with.
good,"The first 10yrs it was a fun place to work, good people, good mang, very good pay and benf for the area.....Then the next 10 yrs things started going down hill...I could see workers just did not enjoy coming to work anymore...Favoritism was being seen in all areas...New management started arriving and it turned in a us against them atmosphere..Various drug situations started occurring  (workers and management) ..We got the production numbers they ask us to achieve, but it was never good enough..Just kept cracking the whip...Workers were stressing, tempers flaring...You could tell things were really changing.....Ot had reached a totally out of control status"
good,"Corning is a big company with high overhead cost and structure.  It has a good policy.  However, enforcing it or following is another story.  The decision making sometime does not base on the fact."
good,It’s ok for a rugual job not somewhere we’re you would want a career totally fine for some people but not me ok pat not the best fast past job hard work good benefits
good,"Working at the Corning plant is much like any other factory. You have to keep in mind safety while enjoying putting in a good days work. As with any factory, plan on working with machines and standing all day."
good,Work is challenging but rewarding. It is a fortune 500 company in a small upstate town.  I am glad to have worked there but promotions are very difficult to get.
good,"I can't really say for the Corning side of the house although all the permanent people that worked there seemed to enjoy the job, benefits and culture.  I was contracting through a firm in India and they were terrible."
good,Good opportunity to work at fortune 500 company. Fast paced work environment was challenging and exciting. Approachable management. Training provided for new skills.
good,"Good place to wock, basically on production tho, if you like a fast pace environment  this will be a perfect job for you. People there are very friendly"
good,I worked for a temp company and the company treated us fairly and valued the job we did.  Advancement seemed easy.  Very laid back environment but hard working culture.
good,"A typical day at work starts at 7am and ends at 3pm, you gown and find your shifted schedule daily it depends on your grade level if your grade for the department is higher you run machines that are faster. The hardest part about the job is most of the machines are not ergonomically correct and the machines are very old and a lot of the production during the shift is hand loading you could load two seperate machines with each machine running about 80,000+ parts per shift."
good,Wyścig miedzy Team Leader-ami. Praca wygląda jak poganianie bydła. Kto szybciej i więcej. Zawsze jest za mało. Przełożeni często nie potrafią się zachować. Brak kultury osobistej. Wyróżnianie sprzedawczyków i niedocenianie dobry pracowników. Zwodzą za nos obiecując lepsze kontrakty. Kiwają pracowników jak się da i kiedy. Wyzysk.
good,"At the IT Call Center we received countless calls per day concerning corporate member issues with software and hardware."
good,"Great place to work, if you need the money. Pass the test and you can retire in 20 years. That simple, it factory work, so you make the best out of what it is."
good,"Solid engineering company with a focused desire to be a market leader within the technology sector. Stresses the importance of fundamental understanding to tough technical problems, allowing them to be one of the most innovative firms in business today."
good,"My job as a Director of Activities was to create and implement activity programs that corresponded with the plan of care for the residents.  This job involved the personalizing the plan of care for each resident and then implementing the plans for all the residents into an activity  calendar for the facility.  There were many details that would need to be ironed out in order to provide the activities to the resident including budgets, staff, and regulations.  I learned a great deal about management and the skills that are needed in order to properly manage a facility and a department in a nursing home.  My coworkers were fun and enjoyable to work with.  The hardest part of my job was balancing my staffs limited number of hours of work with the different activity programs that the company would like to have seen implemented.  The most enjoyable part of my job was to see the enjoyment of the residents during programs."
good,"Everymorning i would come in and head to the production room and check the dirty bins to see if there are any dirty labwares that need to be brought back to the sterile room. if so i would transfer the labware to the sterile room to wash and sterilize for next day use.I work with autoclave, and depryo machines to insure all products is steriles properly and following SOP. every week i would go do ems everymorning to test out room to insure that when products is being produced that the rooms will not contaminates product process or millions of dollar will be wasted. "
good,"As a Union worker you are almost always looked down on by company people. It was great learning different processes and information.  Usually very redundant work.  Testing and measuring glass on machines for most of the day.  Everyone (scientists & managers) think that their work is earth shattering and needs to be done right that second regardless of the work you were doing at that time.  Too many bosses, managers, etc.  Always took direction from MANY people and someone was saying something different from the other.  Overall, union employees are just simply not treated well by the company regardless what they tell you.  Great pay, but terrible vacation time for union workers."
good,"As someone who has worked in the corporate recruiting world and married to a corporate recruiter of Fortune 500 companies, this is not very professional.  I am seeking new employment, not looking to fondly  reminisce about past employers."
good,Very well compensated for the long hours. Overtime was nearly always available. I was low management but was pressured all the time to go above and beyond me goals.
good,You have great benefits but you have to work swing shift. there are a lot of chiefs in management. alwaya have overtime which is 4 hours. good luck getting a day off. fun usually.
good,"Great company and co-workers but not the best work-life balance.  I expect to work extra hours at peak period, however, team member turn over is higher than expected and it takes too long to hire replacements."
good,"This is actually a great place to work.  However because of the competitive process,  I was able to work under a contractor while at this facility.   If you would like to apply to the actual company, you can apply at the companies website.  I was also employed by a temporary agency."
good,"Management just did what they wanted for themselves. it didnt matter if it was wrong. it was what they wanted. "
good,Corning has a good work environment but the hours 12 hrs shifts became a problem with family time. enjoyed working in a group concept. there were 4 different work shifts . there was a lot of overtime most was mandatory
good,A technically challenging and rewarding place to work. It provided a lot of opportunity for technical growth.
good,Most days were good and steady till the management and shift changes took place in my line of work.
good,en Corning no tienen crecimiento laboral solo si eres conocido del alguien en la empresa es como te ayudan
good,"The job environment is stressful and demanding. Even though there were short of workforce, the management did not care to hire more workers. they force us to work overtime everyday."
good,"long hours"
good,Great company with great people.  Just a little behind the times. Manufactures leading edge technology in the optical communications sector but the internal culture does not match the forward thinking and development of innovative solutions.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of meeting up in our office. We would assign tasks and then proceed to get started with our day. I would mop, vacuum, dust, and strip and wax floors. Dust free was the biggest thing we had to deal with but we got it done every week."
good,"aprendi el sistema sap para encontrar mas rapido los materiales ,lo que mas me gusto es que tiempo de mas te lo pagan como tiempo extra , aprendi muchos numeros de parte"
good,Todays' new standards is doing more with less. Many work hours with less people.
good,The pay was great if you can stand the 12 hour swing shifts. Very hot working environment with very few breaks. You stand your entire shift in steel toe boots
good,"Great place to work and very family oriented.  Primary con is that for upper management promotions, time at the company is one of the big deciders, primarily due to flat organization structure and long employee tenure.  If this changes company will be one of the top places for top talent to work."
good,If you dont mind being on the phone all day this is the job for you!
good,It was very confusing on who was your supervisor. The do lay offs to often so there is no job security
good,Hot glass vision system and ceramic multilayer capacitor manufacturing. Process control and instrumentation projects to improve yield.
good,"Great culture with very well stablished values and great benefits, their focus is on building leaders and for those who are up for a challenge get the necessary tools and support to ensure success."
good,My co-workers were great and the atmosphere was fine. I got caught up in a reorganization where they let a massive amount of us go without any warning.
good,My typical day at work is database shutdown at work i learned how to balance work and management skills and very helpfull to co-workers i enjoy every minute in work.
good,"The place was very chill but the swing shift wasn’t it . The work I was doing wasn’t hard at all it was just I didn’t like swing shift at all I would just like to come on days only or nights only not 4 days , Days and 3 days nights"
good,me gusto trabajar en corning porque tiene un buen sistema de trabajo y una buena armonía  con los compañeros de trabajo
good,"Working 12 hr shifts is not for the single person with young children.. Really great people willing to help. Some negativity and envy, but over all, good place to work."
good,"Corning does not seem to hire previous employees once they get a certain age. Applied for SEVERAL positions, some that I held and I did not even rate an interview. Given up working for this company anymore. Not the Corning I used to know and work for."
good,nice flexibility. Too many people thinking they are better than others regardless of how they act when the boss is around. Not the same company that I had worked for in the past.
good,"Company went downhill after dot com crash and Lean Engineers came in.  No Christmas parties, no company picnics. Started worry about employees clocking in 2 minutes too early."
good,Corning overall isn't a bad place to work for someone just out of high school or just starting off. It isn't a good place to work for someone who has children and are doing it by themselves.
good,"it was a amazing place to work and co workers are so cooperative to handle out situations."
good,General day to day project work is fun and enjoyable. You generally get out what you put in.
good,"Excelente ambiente de trabajo, exigente entorno de desarrollo."
good,"Many avenues in which to work. Production to technology, research to development. Corning has it all. Corning uses a ""flex force"", known as a blue badger, to make up about 60% of their work force. This is the group that fills needs quickly as they come, then bares the brunt of a declining economy to keep the white badge, Corning direct, employees, employed. Some blue badgers can work their way into a full Corning employee known as a white badger. This process is not defined, nothing guaranteed, and VERY subjective. Life as a blue badger can be hard, rewarding work, with OK pay and little to no benefits, depending on which contractor you work for. Blue badge contractors are usually left to feel like a necessary evil, but if you need to work and/or want experience, this isn't a bad way to do it."
good,"Corning is a great engineering focused company with industry leading benefits.  This is a great company for technically minded people and you are surround by supportive intellectuals. The hourly workforce is very ""seasoned"" and this can have it's benefits and opportunities."
good,"Corning planta 1 es agradable menos la comida. El ambiente de trabajo es bueno áreas climatizadas"
good,el horaro es muy flaxible para todo tipo de personas
good,"Corning is a good place to work, if you can handle a swing shift. That's the rough part. Trying to adjust you sleep every seven days and then you only have off 1 day or 2 days or four days,  depending on the week."
good,"Corning has competitive pay, excellent benefits. They also have many job different opportunities. Some jobs are harder than others.  They run on 12 hrs shifts 223."
good,"I love working for Corning, I would love to become a full-time employee of Corning rather than a contractor. I've learned so much about quality control working there. The hardest part of the job really is the shift I work, it does not The best part of the job is that you get to learn all about new and exciting innovations and the people are great.allow me much time with my family."
good,Great job!!! Beautiful people schedule was awesome and the breaks are rotated which was phenomenal one of New River Valleys outstanding businesses to work for 🤗
good,Corning is actually a pretty nice place to work but the lay is kind of low and it’s hard to advance in your career. But it’s sometimes a fair place to work.
good,"Corning Inc. provides good compensation for the amount of work that is put in. However, it does depend on which department that you are working for as to how fast or if you will be able to advance if you are trying to further your career."
good,"Overall,  good place to work.  Most of the time the work is not super hard.  Great benefits.   24/7 operation with swing shifts.  Swing shifts can be hard to adjust to.  Get 7 straight days off a month if you don't have to work overtime."
good,"Great company to work for in that there is a wide variety of technologies, and a company culture of innovation. there is never a lack of things to do, and the work is interesting. The company fosters a very civil workplace, and encourages working in teams."
good,Many opportunities to work there in a diverse company. Pay for the average worker was well above average pay. Good benefits but mostly 24/7 operations for the working class which meant swing shifts and 7 day schedules.
good,"Good company overall.People are nice. Great working environment."
good,"Company with family values, opportunity for personal growth, technically challenging, very nice facilities, new labs and office spaces."
good,"- 8 hors of work and managing customer complaints, NCR, various audits and internal customers at work."
good,Corning has been a good place to continue to develop my own knowledge and understanding of IT Security as it applies to both a Shared Service model as well as a manufacturing environment which tends to struggle with legacy issues.
good,"j'était chargée des récupérais un certain nombres de pièces en fin de ligne et de fait la vérification assez rapidement pour  que si le prélèvement était bon , je disait rien . Mais par contre si il y avait un défaut  je devais sanctionne la production informatiquement  et prévenir mon régleur du défaut rapidement pour pas faire trop de perte . Et  que le responsable est assez d’échantillons de contrôle durant tout un poste ."
good,I have what they call Relief shift hours. The most i am on one shift is 4 days. I am what they call a Hit Guy here at the plant which consist of team leaders calling for a hit mechanic and i go out and fix the issue. It is the instant gradification that i like so well. Hardest part of the job is shift.
good,"Training people one minuate, sitting in on disciplinary meetings, then filling in for the supervisor when they were out."
good,Great place to work. Great people. I learned a lot and the pay was great for the area and for that time.
good,I had lots of opportunities to learn many things. The colleagues and work atmosphere was very collegial and conducive for productive work.
good,"Every day in Corning was different than the day before. Optical amplifiers were a new product and we were learning every day from the day before."
good,"Corning is a tremendous organization with a diverse portfolio, strong commitment to its values, and great investment in its employees."
good,"Forced overtime and 7 day rotating swing shift gave way to very little family time, however, great benefits, compensation, and many perks."
good,"Work very closely with legal counsel, scientists, government agencies on a daily basis. Create and Manage proposals to government and maintain compliance in several reporting environments. Love the diversity and flexibility of the workplace and the interaction with the scientists as they articulate the interaction they would like to pursue."
good,It pays very well but with the rotating shifts you give up a lot of family life.
good,"glad to be out of there. people are ok, management sucks, hot and heavy lifting"
good,"Any review of Corning Inc needs to have the asterisk of ""if you are a white badge"", meaning if you are a real employee vs a temp. Corning has no shame in the caste system of important employees and disposable contract workers. If you work in IT in Corning, you will be hired from one of many temp agencies and the managers cannot contractually give you any help, advice or suggestions. They can assign work and that's about it."
good,"Fast paced innovative programs. "
good,The pay along with the opportunity for overtime. This is based on customer demand for products. We have shift work that is tough but allows us time off with a 7 day break every 28 days depending on OT
good,This company has the best teamwork in the world. The technology and innovation is like no other. I encourage you to apply for Corning. I miss working for the company and would join again in a heartbeat.
good,"Around the clock workplace, 12hrs; with mandatory overtime weekly. Working 4\5 straight 12hr days. Overall, that's a good place to work. They believe in all hands on deck. From production operators to supervisors, quality assurance to work on production floor. Always modifying equipment for profession and productivity. PPE is very important code to the workplace. Have work in other areas within the company; multitasking, line leader, inventory and more. Receipt to stock, everything matters. Changes are always happen; new product, employees, production lines."
good,"If you have a technical background, the Corning will be a good fit. If you have a commercial background, the chances of getting laid off is high. Overall, a good company."
good,"Good money, no life, and every four years there is a typical lay off. You can make some really good money, entry level here, and room too grow if you know the right people."
good,This company is a worldwide company.  You work a swing shift either 7day or 5day.  In this company you may bid for jobs in other areas.
good,"Decent place to work,  I just don't make enough to support my family."
good,To set machine according to order that was need before the beginning of each shift.
good,I started my first job at Axygen-Corning in 2008 . It was great experience working here as I have learnt a lot from here. My colleagues are very co-operative and helpful.
good,"Corning was a great place to work, there benefit package is great. The only thing that I didn't like is they don't let you give your previous employer 2 weeks notice, and then they laid me off 37 days later."
good,"Overall work environment and benefit are good. When we have a project their support system is well organized. But, they need to improve management system."
good,"Great place to work however may positions are contractor roles with limited opportunity becoming ""full-time"" Corning Employee. "
good,I liked the hours. The jobs atmosphere and Supervisors were not professional. Would've stayed longer if there was better Supervision and room for growth. High turn over rate also.
good,"Es una empresa buena con mucho futuro, tiene sus ventajas y desventajas como todas las empresas, algunos buscamos estabilidad laboraly crecimiento laboral. Con ganas y esfuerzo se puede obtener el exito, claro brincando alguno que otro obstaculo."
good,threat summer internship students as full-time employee. very kind to workers and many great learning opportunities either online or face-to-face with managers.
good,"Long hours, good pay, union.  Opportunities for advancement. Plenty of overtime, if that's what you desire, sometimes you have no choice.  Cant really plan anything unless you have a vacation day planned.  Give two weeks notice for a vacation. No PTO"
good,"It was okay, people were catty and cliquey, advancement was near impossible, and nepotism was rampant. Overall I enjoyed working there but had no room to advance and the workplace suffered from poor management of other departments"
good,Good job to work but hard on family life. Too many overtime hours every week that interferes with family life. People are very hard to work with from lack of supervision
good,"It was very exciting working with Corning. I learned about fiber optic. The workplace was very clean, Be careful of chemicals. The hardest part of the job was mostly standing for 12 hours."
good,"Corning has great pay and overall the best health insurance that you can find in North Carolina. The people are nice, but the work schedule is (by personal opinion) not that good."
good,Very strict policies pertaining to safety to be met with constant supervision by safety and in house foremans on each floor that work duties were being performed.  Almost overcrowded by other workers in tight spaces on each floor and sharing of equipment as in scizzor and boom lifts between contractors and other employees.
good,I was working 12 hour straight shifts at night which was great except that I was unable to see my son for 3 days at a time due to having to sleep and go right back into work.  I recently switched to the 12 hour day shift position but had to relinquish certain skill sets and 2.70/hr in order to accomplish that being as everything is based on seniority.  The job itself can be rather meticulous and repetitive but is also quite enjoyable since you are allowed to socialize with people from many different backgrounds.  I would not choose to leave this job if it wasn't for the fact that I do not have stable child care for my son.
good,"Overall great company to work with.  Like the involvement of co-workers to ensure daily percentage were met.  Accrue 95% or greater for fiber optics.  Hard part consist of learning new attributes to the machines which were a challenge but manageable.   Enjoyed learning, learning from mistakes to make and have the best product."
good,I was a SharePoint Analyst & Support. I taught users how to use SharePoint and I would develop SharePoint websites for them. I enjoy meeting a lot of the upper management and enjoyed working with my colleagues.
good,Corning overall is a good company to work for.  Typically there is a lot of travel and a lot of different experiences to have.
good,Corning will switch your shift at a moments notice at a moments notice. They will tell you at the beginning of the year there will be no shut downs so you cancel all vacation plans. Then they tell you a week before that they are shutting down and that leaves no time to plan a vacation.
good,You are on your own
good,"This is a company that is committed to continuous improvement, driving innovation, and providing a challenging and motivating work experience."
good,"I manufactured Fused Silica using CNC milling machines, and operated CMM regularly to ensure internal/external customer dimensions. I performed metrology test and analyzed data to ensure purity of Fused Silica and I carried out detail quality assurance inspections on finished goods prior to shipment. The most challenging part of the job was learning the most possible about different aspects of metrology and the most enjoyable part of the job was working with and learning from such a diverse and competent group of technicians, engineers and management."
good,Good cultural environment and helpful people all around. Intelligent people to work with and enjoyable job. Learned a lot with communication and branching out to find the things necessary to do the best job possible.
good,Excellent company to work for....you can make as much money as you want with overtime.  Only problem is overtime can take over your life as there is so much to go around.
good,"descanso de 20 minutos en jornadas largas, con goce de comida dentro de la empresa."
good,"This company has excellent benefits and the pay is fair for the cost of living in the area.  The work hours and shifts can be very difficult, so it is not a great work-life balance."
good,Corning supports its employees as it strives to achieve business results.  There are opportunities for training and leadership development.  Also the company lives up to the values that it promotes.
good,"Corning is truly a great place to work. I very much regret leaving there. They value their #1 asset, their employees and go above and beyond to show their appreciation for them."
good,I'm enjoying what we are doing at Corning Inc. Prefer to have a cubicle office but the guys are fun to work with and are very knowledgeable. I'm expecting a tour of the company next week.
good,"A typical day, check backups, make sure they ran and finished with no errors. The pace can be slow one minute and fast the next you just never know what is going to happen from day to day. Most enjoyable part of the job is getting to interact with people face-to-face. The hardest part of the job is losing some of eh technical duties, like setting up user accounts, password resets. that all went to a third party company."
good,"I'm in an engineering division where it's mostly desk job, but get to travel to Asia for projects. Also based on the types of projects, you get to have a lot of hands on experience as well"
good,"Its a great job but hard to advance without schooling. Great atmosphere. Management is non involved unless a problem arises. Coworkers are great, got along with everyone."
good,found it  to be a good place to wor where I learned a lot about the process and tools required. I also learned quite a lot on interpersonal relationships
good,Overall this is a good company to work for however their production schedule leaves something to be desired at times. Good job security.
good,I loved working for Corning. The only bad thing I can say is that there wasn't much opportunity for job advancement and there wasn't any job security.
good,Can't beat the compensation and benefits from this company.
good,its a 24 hr operation . You come in and get a pass down and continue were last shift stopped. The hardest part off job was the employee you are following might not be up to your standards.
good,"Corning Fiber Optics is cleaner than most hospitals. "
good,"Corning was established in 1851 and has a history of being on the cutting edge of technological research and product development using glass and glass derivatives.  The focus on R & D has been guided by a vision and understanding of the future of technological advancement, and has yielded such diverse products as glass for the first light bulb, missile nose covering material, fiber optics, ceramic substrate for pollution control, etc."
good,"For a person what to learn, you can reach the top talent of the field."
good,"This was my first job coming out of school. Absolutely great company to work for, but just about every location is in a sucky area. Makes it super difficult for young family baren professionals."
good,A typical day is a balance between strategic discussions with staff and providing direction/supervision to my department.
good,"This is a great job, its not difficult, the money is good and so are the benefits. However, most of the union workers work a seven day swing shift which allows so time for a family or life outside of work."
good,Enjoyed my time there. Only 85 day intern. World have liked to stay.
good,"job was steady, lots of tasks to keep you moving. Management was a little hard to pin down and talk to, but co workers were all very helpful and friendly."
good,"The Optical group in Corning Inc is a well-oiled machine with established culture and relationships.   Its a terrific place, if nothing changes.   Challenging to break-in."
good,Will allow you to grow in the company. Work life balance gets hard sometimes but they make it work. Great administration and great copirate communication.

good,"Good place to work with polite culture; rural area;"
good,"La empresa es amplia con un buen ambiente laboral, y te aprecian en el trabajo."
good,"This is a great place to work, to learn a new way of research. If you do not know how something works they take the time to teach you."
good,Started as full time produce clerk.Became assistant produce manager within a year. Two years later became produce manager.If you work hard and want to advance.It can be very rewarding but as a manager you are salary and will put in a lot of hours.
good,Excellent company where cutting edge of technology is the name of the game. Very collaborative and inclusive work environment with other highly educated individuals.
good,"Manejo de un proceso en diferentes areas de la empresa"
good,It was a stable and great work environment. At corning it is easy to Advance and there's plenty of over time available. A teamwork environment and everyone works together.
good,"Work is very cyclical, so be wary of temp jobs for security. If you are laid off from a contract due to a bad year, you won't find any other work in the area because the area jobs are all at this company. Corning, NY is a small company town. Expect to run into your manager or co-workers once a month minimum at the grocery store. Beyond this, its a good work atmosphere, if not slightly viscous with the company oriented smiles. Either you can work with company politics or you can't."
good,Great place to work if you're young and just starting out in the work field.  Great benefits and pay if you stay there long enough to advance your job position.
good,it was an interesting place to work for a company that was always striving to improve. management and coworkers were cooperative and friendly. the work schedule was trying but the benefits were great. I enjoyed the fast pace physical part of the job.
good,"small company town environment, housing prices reasonable, housing value increase poor, company commitment to local culture, safe,  nice place to raise family but quite a distance to major metropolitan areas."
good,Can be stressful at times but also can be very quiet.  Sadly this job isn't very steady.  You can either be very slow and the day takes forever.  You can also be crazy busy.
good,"Buen ambiente laboral , en lo personal me a servido mucho el apendisaje optenido , he aprendido a manejar diferentes dispositivos de medion."
good,I worked many positions in Corning as a Union worker. I loved having the opportunity to try new jobs. The pay was great and the benefits were good.  I disliked the rotating shifts.
good,"es una gran escuela con un staff completo de trabajo."
good,"Developing new Fiber Products for clients and then training the work crews on the installation of these new item was a good way to stay active in the business and learn what was really needed there. I enjoyed traveling to Europe - Canada the US and Mexico,"
good,"Es una empresa con una cultura laboral excelente, te permiten desarrollarte profecionalmente, involucrarte en proyectos que te brindan la oportunidad de crecer personalmente."
good,"Fun, but not where I wanted to be.  Was not a social work position."
good,overall a nice place to work. The hours were good and the teamwork great.
good,Kept production equipment running to produce the highest quality and yield.
good,A typical day in the research division includes a flexible work schedule. The most important thing is that you perform on your assigned project. I worked there for over 10 years. I had a good relationship with most of my supervisors.
good,"A fast, pace environment that is always change.  Your job can be challenging, but rewarding as well.  A large group of highly educated individuals who are technically advanced and on the cutting edge of technology.  Hardest part of leaving the company was leaving the people."

good,"Good place to work, nice work environment. Less hectic work load. Good, helpful colleagues. Nice work and personal life balance. Good learning experience"

good,"This is a company that still believe in a career.  They invest in their people and want them to stay.  They have a long term vision/strategy and are on the leading edge of technology. Outstanding corporate communication and investment in people, process and technology."
good,Advancement is always an opportunity at Corning. The culture is real laid back and relaxed. You are really well compensated with a bonus at the beginning of every year.
good,"You can learn quite a lot things like culture, organization, and regulation about the company, and the whole internship is quite chill. But if you are not going to work at glass manufactoring industry, this position won't help you too much."
good,Corning Incorporated is a good company to work for. The work is always interesting with new development opportunities and challenges. Moving within the company can be challenging.
good,"This is a great place to work.It is fair, very clean, everyone respects each other.There is a lot of safety.There is a security guard outside during all shifts."
good,Great place to work. Surrounded by good people and pick up on the work very fast. I had the honor of working in different areas such as assembly the hot room and box building.

good,Job is a great environment just i  feel like I’m underpaid and i bring more to the table i know my worth. Not an hard job it’s all about common since and communication
good,To work for Corning Inc. through Noramtech has allowed for many challenges and positive experiences.  I have had the opportunity to expand my skills on my DMAIC skills and sharpen my financial skills.  A typical day for me allows for diversity in the work environment.  Management is exceptional.  The hardest part of working as a contract employee through Corning is not knowing if you will be hired permanently or if your contract will be extended until the last month.  The people you encounter are very helpful and very team oriented.
good,Rotating sift work is the hardest thing to adjust to because of the constant change from Day shift to night shift and visa versa. Because of the testing requirement to begin working here you are almost guaranteed that most of the people that are working there actually want to be there. Most of the employees strive to make the plant process better than what it is.
good,Corning is continuously coming up with new products while working to improve existing products.  We also have many products on the shelf in which time is spent looking for initial or new applications.  We work in teams to push technology forward and we work across teams to share learnings.  Some days are long and stressful but we share in our triumphs and it makes these days worth while.
good,"Productive and fast paced, rotating shifts, lots of overtime, family ff"
good,"Corning was a great company, great benefits, I truly have nothing bad to say about them. Wish I could have transferred, but that's unallowed. Would return back, if opportunity came up."
good,Corning was a very fast-work environment. You worked hard but still got the job done in time. The environment was friendly and helpful but also serious and calm at the same time.
good,I liked the professional and stress free environment.  Co-workers are very helpful when we do not understand something.
good,A typical day at work involves inspecting product that will be sent to the customer to make sure all spec requirements are met from the production process. I have learned a lot of about multiple production processes along with safety regulations. The quality dept. has a great crew of people that I work with.
good,Get to learn a lot of things in a short span of time and working in team is what you get to learn from here and management is awesome
good,"During the 13.5 years that I was there, there were a lot of good times.  Business was good and so were the rewards and benefits we were given."

good,"The high level technical environment cfostered a strong team based workplace. Challenges arose when confronted by individuals putting their own agendas ahead of what was best for the shareholder and for the customer. Most rewarding was the team focus, one which thrived within the very diverse cultural teams."
good,"Fully satisfied and have been highly recognized for each of my contributions in the Life Science. Great place to work and provides a excellent learning opportunities, exposure and experience."
good,I enjoy working there and it's a very positive working environment with a lot of very good people there. The job is certainly not for everybody but most of the people there like what they do and you find out pretty quickly if you aren't cut out for it.
good,El ambiente laboral es bueno ya que a veces se te exige mas de lo que puedes dar.
good,"As an intern I did not not get to see many of the inner workings of the company or many of its divisions, but from the experience I had there it is a very well run company that cares for its employers."
good,Everyday was a different project or product that had to be worked on which kept it from getting too routine. The people were very helpful and friendly.
good,Plenty of opportunities in corning. The training was very efficient and the people are easy to work with. Great company to work for. The company grows and changes fast.
good,Loved my position with Corning.  My responsibilities included extensive travel and that was enjoyable.  The role of project engineer on capital equipment builds was stressful but rewarding.
good,Corning is an excellent place to work.  The culture and management are some of the best I've ever experienced.  You really feel like you are part of a team.
good,Corning Inc is a great place to work. Everyone there is friendly and kind. Safety is the key aspect at the company.If you're use to working 12 hour shifts then this is a great place for you.
good,Corning provides employees with an environment where they can easily learn and grow. Employees are encourage to develop new skills outside of their area of expertise. Corning is good to its employees and provides a very comfortable and inclusive work environment.
good,"Exciting and innovative environment with opportunities for scientific research. Some good managers, some less so.  Good pay and benefits.  Periodic layoffs hinder job security."
good,"Corning Inc. was a great place to work. The culture of inclusion and diversity made it a welcoming place to go to everyday. Being part of the discovery processes each and every day was very rewarding."
good,"I was only there for a month assisting with budget season as an accounting clerk. While there, though, the management team was nice and so were my co-workers. Everyone knew my name even co-workers I haven't been introduced to. I enjoyed it and would definitely go back if they had an opening."
good,I was fortunate enough to be brought in to start a whole new operation at Corning and work 7-330 M-F. I become CPR certified here and completed safety classes and medical classes. Management is really good at communication with employees and making sure you have what you need. The hardest part of the job was at times training others to be safe but still be able to do their job effectively.
good,"high expectations and aggressive environment"
good,"great job until the plant closed, advanced to group leader on second shify, enjoyed the job until economic downturn forced company shutdown"
good,es una empresa para mi muy importante donde lo mejor que es que los orarios estan muy bien y te dan los fines de semana o se ajuntan ala posibilidades que tu tienes en pocas palabras es lo mejor
good,"Excellent workplace....Laidoff due to lack of work. Teamwork, excellent co-workers, run diesel engines and test exhaust, offshift work schedule (7pm - 7am). Very tired from 4am - 7am. Company big on safety."
good,I appreciate the company atmosphere and the manufacturing experience I get to behold. You will meet many great people and will be charged with projects that make you grow as an engineer.
good,nice place to work. good people. happy place.room to advance. state of the art equipment. very clean. free lunch fridays. one hour lunches. two breaks
good,"productive and fun workplace. Good work environment. Good team meets. The hardest part is working in the big manufacturing unit."
good,I enjoyed working at Corning. I met many wonderful people and participated in many community events held by the company. I learned from my peers and was given challenging projects.
good,Structured company with a good outlook while I was there. Has plenty of opportunities to grow within the company.
good,I had a few project that I would work on thought the day. I spent about  two thirds of my time at my desk with one third being in the plant environment. I was constantly working with maintenance and operators for my projects. The culture is very team oriented.
good,"Responsibilities included, but were not limited to, learning the process, SPC charts, specs and ensuring the movement of product, while maintaining a clean and safe working environment. Training co-workers, prioritizing work flow to a team of 10-20 employees, scheduling breaks and performing written and verbal passdowns to management."
good,"A good company to work for. Nice people ,good work atmosphere, and  caring management. I operated several tools in a sterile work environment. I leaned quite a bit about the extrusion process. It was very enjoyable work."

good,Excellent company to work for. There are lots of opportunities to learn and improve yourself. The location is not good though.
good,Corning is a great place to learn how to be a good supervisor/manager. It is also supportive of professional development. The 360 review process is the best objective review process I've experienced
good,I worked at corning for 2 summers as an intern and I was definitely given the opportunity to grow and learn as an R&D scientist. I would say that people are supportive and nice.
good,"Empresa donde hay crecimiento Laboral"
good,The current culture is all driven by old age management style. The company needs to reinvent if they want to compete with the technology company. The location is very poor.
good,Ay veces hay poco material y solo nos ponen a limpiar para no vernos sin hacer nada y cuando si hay mucho material si hay mucha precion para sacar buena produccion
good,"The people are very acceptable no matter what enthinicity , race , religion. They are all about culture. They are very family friendly as well. The communication is very professional. They keep up with stats and issues that need to be resolved within the company. They are all about your safety."

good,This was my first real grown up job out of college. Fortune 500 company with cutting edge technology. Great opportunity to grow as a professional but difficult to advance due to the hierarchy of things.

good,"Although the work hours work well for me (3rd Shift) I have found I greatly miss the customer experience.  The location is well suited being close to where I live."
good,"Long hours"
good,"My experience with Corning was stimulating, challenging and very interesting. Corning has a singular corporate focus on glass and anything to do with the processing of glass and ceramics, including the history of glass making, as well as media for very fine art, and as engineered materials for industrial applications ranging from water filters and kiln liners to cookware to high tech fiber optics. This company has a unique business model that may be difficult at times for institutional investors to analyze. Corning business enterprises include wholly owned subsidiaries as well as 50/50 joint ventures worldwide. The real value of Corning lies in its people and the intellectual property they create, the processes and patents. It was my good fortune to spend 5 years with such an impressive organization."

good,"I love my job and I work for a good company with good standing in our community and around the world.  There are other plants located in other states and countries, so the possibility is endless as far as where you are restricted to for living."
good,"I worked for Corning Inc. for almost four years. It was the best paying job with the best benefits I'd ever had and have had so far. The hours with working swing shift was a bit much to handle while still trying to manage your life outside of work, especially with not getting many days off. The pay and benefits made up for that in my opinion. It was easy work once you learned the different positions but it could be more challenging if you decided to step up, as I did with learning how to fix many faults and becoming a line lead. It definitely was not a bad job and the only reason I had to leave was because I moved out of state and there were no openings at the Corning plant where I moved to. I do hope to work for Corning Inc. again some day."
good,"The only negative thing I have to say about Corning is that even though I am under a 365 day contract they could get rid of me at any time. Not because I have done anything wrong but because they are no longer in need of me anymore. This would also come with no notice, as I have known others that this has happened to. One previous worker was headed home for the day and received a phone call on his way home saying- ""Please do not come in to work tomorrow, your services are no longer needed"". This new came after a promise from the company that he would be made permanent after his 2nd term contract was completed. Other than that the company is great and for the few lucky ones that are permanent full time they have been here for 20+ years and have not one bad thing to say."
good,"Corning Incorporated is an exceptional place of employment!  The Capricorn team was top notch.  They were flexible , patient and encouraging.  It was a great experience working with these fine people."
good,"Corning is like going to Oz or in a real Disney Land. Opportunities to learn, create, travel and make a difference in the world abound. People are like family. Leadership generally leaves you alone."
good,"I like working at Corning. Great team environment, Company really tries to go out of its way to take care of its employees. I would recommend Corning to my peers."
good,Solid business sense and direction.  Excellent at innovation and new product introductions.  Invested in and developed the workforce.   Values were practiced.
good,"As an operator I did splices on armor,  water block tape,  and ripcords as needed while my line was running.  If so needed i did change overs to switch cable sizes or from armor cable to dialect cable.  I learned what the differences between all different fiber optic cables are.  Management wasn't what it should have been,  hardly any communication at all.  My co-workers were awesome,  excellent communication.  If there was a knot or the print was wrong the helper had to immediately tell me so i could slow the line down and check the cable.  The hardest part of the job for me was when i had to run 1728 fiber cable,  Its the biggest and most expensive they make.  I loved the job and my co-workers.  I loved being in control of the production process of making fiber optic cable."
good,Great working environment.  Pay and benefits were excellent.  The only problem was that Corning Inc. lays off employees often.
good,"Loved the work, but layoff eminent. Must get used to long work shifts, however the monthly week off is a huge bonus"
good,"Great benefits, salary and people. Management cares about their employees. Slot of folks there spend 20 plus years working at Corning and that says slot about the place."
good,"12 Hours Rotating Shifts"
good,A great corporate cuslture with focus on innovation. Great learning and growth opportunities. Compensation is low and insurance expensive. Goal sharing benefits are good.
good,Pay is great for some and not great for others - it's not consistent.  Good clean environment with great people.  Great advancement in certain areas - just depends on where you are at.
good,"the rotating shifts make it hard to get used to, they were working on that when I left. they are very safety oriented. We were able to have different things that the Employee and Family were able to go to, liking bowling."
good,Love working with the people I do everyday. Work is challenging and you are surrounded by people that want you to succeed . I find that Corning does a great job at cultivating a culture that helps individuals grow and find the work/life balance that you want
good,"Working as a contractor so there are no Corning benefits.  Contract company does provide health, dental and vision with a few paid holidays.  Working environment is good, do your job, look for opportunities to improve the work process and make your mark.  Options are always available."
good,"Excellent place to work, can be difficult to get on full time.  You start out as a contractor and then they may or may not hire you.  Great place to work though."
good,"Our work schedule is Mon-Fri, shifts alternate weekly from 06:45 to 15:00 and second shift is 14:45 to 23:00."
good,"Through direct sales identified, pursued and maximized opportunities in the greater Chicago area related to the fiber optic and structured cable business in enterprise network market.

good,Great work atomsphere and good working conditions. The work was interesting and I enjoyed working with the people there. The compensation is fair and good.
good,"Rotating shifts (Day, Night, weekends) 12 hour days, focused on monthly production and safety. Management provides guidance and training, they leave everyday activities to the lead who works a position on the floor alongside everyone else. The hardest part of the day is near end of shift, clean up and post equipment inspection."
good,"Fast paced day generally, swing shift some 7 day some 5 day. Repetitive work but not overall hard jobs. Two 15 minute breaks and a 30 minute lunch. They take good care of their workers"
good,"Excellent Corporation to work for "

good,"*Typical day at work - Attend pre-shift meeting. Relieve person on floor and take over their job. Ex. Saw operator or quality control person. The last job I had involved knowing 7 different jobs on the production floor. Sometimes in an eight hour period, I would be doing 2 to 3 different jobs. (never boring)"

Then move to the information services center to do the day's programming work for the accounting department. Early on the full time programming staff is helpful, but does like to see increasing autonomy of the contract worker as time progresses.
