rating,review
bad,I have nothing good to say about this company... They are letting people go to save money to buy out Anadarko. They do their very best to hide or change the story of an incident to make them sound more safe.
bad,"Too Much Office Pollitics, I did not like it, there was a lot of work and opportunity to do it and save the company Money, but due to secretaries running the department I decided to leave."
bad,"The records center was horribly managed, and the processes in place to efficiently operate were simply not in place.  The revolving door atmosphere made it impossible to know who worked there and who didn't.  I would NEVER recommend ANYONE works there."
bad,"Upper management knows lower management has issues, but there's no backbone to support the workers needs. Shell stuck Oxy without any drawings and no P&id's to support the site locations, Oxy pays big railroad commission fines. Backstabbing and pettiness with the whites and Hispanics exist. Big bonuses big pay, off road vehicles given for personal usage with gas cards for perms nothing for temps. Nepotism, young egos run amuck. Sadly a big name with liability issues, I'm waiting for the news media to report a tragic loss and hefty fines, the governing agencies should inspect this company."
bad,I truly enjoyed what I did for work. I learned a lot of skill that i think could help me in the future at a new company. I'm not fond of how the place was managed but i took only positive things away from this position
bad,"Got offered a contract job after going through 3 interviews over 2 months. Basically told I'd be hired direct in a few months. Got the run around everytime I spoke with management. Felt like I was a filler until guys from LTD came back. Never worked at a place where everyone complained about each other so much. Nasty cancer causing chemicals require you to do 90% of the real work with supplied air respirators and other uncomfortable PPE. Not a nice staff, everyone there hates each other and talks behind everyone's back. Makes you wonder what they say about you when you're not around. They make it sound so much better than it is. They make you do 3 months of classroom training with tests and force you to memorize hundreds of valve tag numbers when you never need to know it again and then rush your on the job training which is awful. They have over 200 procedures which you just read and sign off on then are expected to remember at the drop of a hat. Half the work is outside in the winter with the worst having to climb up 200 foot silos to fix an automatic valve. Just not a good job unless you don't care about your physical and mental health."
bad,This company is quick to make you feel like you don't belong. It is clickish and would rather find ways to make you miserable than find oil. They don't want you to stay long so forget about any future there. 2 years is tops. Learn as much as you can during that time and then RUN !
bad,"I worked for this company for 5 years as a customer service representative in the Dallas Area. This was one of the most stressful jobs that I have ever had. The managers are not supportive of their customer service representatives. They overload you with work and you have no one to assist you, if you get behind. They favor the salesman over the customers service reps. There is no opportunity for growth and everything is so micromanaged. When I left this job, it felt like a ton on bricks had been lifted off of me. I wouldn't recommend that anyone work here. Also, there is no diversity at this place. RUN from this place !!"
bad,"The workforce is at each others throats. You really don't who to trust, your true friends are very few and far in-between. Your trainer who is also your Union representative can be your worst enemy in destroying you if they are overtime hungry. "
bad,"I own the faults I made while employed here. However, unless you had a father or relative that was a salaried employee at some point working at Oxy don't plan on advancing. The Union will only fight for you if it's in their political interest. So unless you have the ability to lie with a straight face and can transfer blame on someone else, you'll be quite successful. Should you unfortunately have a conscience, you're going to suffer."
bad,"Occidental Petroleum has given me the ability to grown and learn more about the industry I am in. Even though they are going through hard time and relocating most departments to Houston, the experience I have received will be beneficial to me in the future."
bad,"The work culture is absolutely terrifying. The bosses are awful. They have a ""if we fire you today you can't get hurt tomorrow"" policy. The preach safety while whopping you for production to increase their profits. You are a # that can be replaced in a moment's notice."
bad,I wouldn’t *** on Oxy or its employees if they were burning and screaming for relief.  All people do is backstab you to make themselves look better.!!
bad,"Talk about a job where mgmt does not care about the hourly workers...."
bad,What I was sold in my interview was not what I received on the job.
bad,"This is not a company for contractors. There is no growth, or permanent positions. Some people has been there over 16 years and finally became permanent."
bad,Oxy needs management changes in the worst way. It can really be a cut throat place and management seems to like that in employees. Employees are not treated the same and some are treated unfairly and no one seems to care. People who go to HR amazingly become poor performing over night and eventually fired.
bad,"Placed here through Iron Mountain and IM sucks, from co-workers to management. Compensation sucks not worth it at all."
bad,"Manager functions as a micromanager."
bad,"You basically just do what your told and keep your head down. I learned about Wellheads and Central Tank Batteries, and how to use and adjust the settings on isogen. Management doesn't care about developing a real drafting and design group."
bad,Worked here as a millwright. Safety record is made up. They tied the bonus to safety so if you got hurt everyone hated you and treated you like a pariah. Worked with older international correspondence school “millwrights” who mostly still work there. Great pay and benefits plus bonus. Most management got walked out for financial improprieties. Might be better now but doubt it. HR Head isn’t very good at his job and has questionable loyalties to some workers. Lots of chemicals that cause cancer. Mostly pipe fitting work not millwright work.
bad,Several years of regulatory coordinating with several companies while providing updates and recommendations to management team as it relates to oil and gas regulations and rules.
bad,"MY first two years with Occidental Petroleum was very hard work, but I enjoyed the work, the people I worked with and felt that my direct managers understood the need for a work/life balance."
bad,This was not a great place to work as the direct management team made every effort to belittle and supress creative ideas. There was no room for any error or employees were threatened with their jobs.
bad,"cut throat,micromanaged company,they do not care about your safety,they just care about production,managers undercut each other,making for a bad working environment"
bad,"Every day could be your last day. Everyday you wonder if today will be the day that Management sends you home, or lets you keep working, all while wondering when they're going to fire you and hope the Arbitrator sides with you."
bad,"My experience with this company was okay. I had a couple of supervisor's, that were good people and some good co-worker's. Things change within a company sometimes and sometimes the changes are good for employee's or they are not and I realized it was time to move on."
bad,"Oxy's direct employees get their relatives and spouses hired at an above average rate."
bad,"The atmosphere is laid back but thier supervisors lack the experience in managing the process and thier people. They lack on training in specific posotions critical to the process and what thier goal is. No procedures to follow only word of mouth or supervisor emails. It is a very political atmosphere to worl in with the blind leading the blind. Thier supervisors are so inexperienced, that the try to wing it as much as they can to get by. They need an experienced trainer specifically for operators and DCS personnel and a training program specific to the facilty instead of through emails and word of mouth. They have alot of growing to do in this industry before they conssider themselves leaders in this industry."
bad,It was an ok company. Management could use a cleaning and not so much stress on production than safety.
bad,The atmosphere in this place was very hard to deal with if you want a work life balance.  There is a lot that is thrown on you and the culture of the place was not what I had expected
bad,I was excited to work for this company when I first came aboard.
bad,Management is lackluster at best they don't care what goes on only that they get their paychecks. None of the management is in touch with the other departments they don't care what goes on just as long as you don't get in there way. If you try to make suggestions they just act like you are trying to step on their toes. The job is nice you get every other Friday off but you have to put up with a lot of politics and other draining things.
bad,"overall good place to work advancement, can be a challenge, not many positions to apply for. the operation can use more personnel in many areas to have the entire operation run much more efficiently."
bad,POlitical not much to add. the company needs better direction. managers are switching positions all the time which affects the employees performance at the end of year
good,"Working in multidisciplinary environment with engineers and geoscientists. Learning new technical skills. Ability to see my projects come to fruition. "
good,Decent work environment. Decent training opportunities and fairly interesting projects. Upper management could improve communication to greater organization.
good,"Williston group has only existed for 3 years."
good,Compensation and benefits packages are great.
good,Pay and bonuses need lots of improvement. Vacation policy was ok. Management in my department was awful. If management changed I would consider going back if the pay scale was adjusted.
good,Worked Long Days and several hours without an option in my role as a contractor to capture some benefits.  The office building  in midland is fairly new.
good,"Critical under-staffing leads to a lot of work being dumped on relatively few people.  Technical positions go unfilled for months due to low salary offers and HR red tape.  Management targets no more than 50th percentile for salaries, and grades positions lower to justify paying even less.  If you are an above average engineer and have strong ethics, you would probably be happier someplace else."
good,"Great place to work but very old school atmosphere. Benefits are nice but it's difficult to move up because employee turnover is very very low. Management on other teams will not even consider you for a position, even if you are fully capable, unless you fit perfectly into their job description."
good,"People there are good, not much of a culture at all, low oil prices and not the best timing (recently purchased a company their same size) have the higher-ups making frantic changes."
good,"Very good benefits, pay was competitive, was not in agreement of all their culture. Had very large area to support in the I&E Planning/Scheduling role. Requested contract support and was denied. Resigned shortly thereafter."
good,"The office environment is laid back, love the 9/80 schedule and there are some wonderful people but Oxy doesn't care at all about leased workers it literally takes years to try to get hired on. When you ask about being hired on they give you a pre recorded answer that they're working on it but it never happens. Management doesn't care at all that they have good people wanting to be a part of the company that are already helping the company reach their goals, they're too cheap to hire on contract workers but obviously have plenty of money to bid for other oil companies that they want."
good,"No clarity on the roles, no continuity on task assigned."
good,"typical day includes morning meetings followed by afternoon meetings to plan next day, enjoyed projects, management turnover is high, work place culture safety first,"
good,"I learned to stay focus and do my job. The employees clicked in groups, especially the administration group.  I enjoyed my tenure."
good,I have learned numerous things about a Supply Chain and how it works with extensive knowledge of contracts.  I have great co-workers that help out with my training a lot. The hardest part of the job is not getting a lot of training from management.  This is not the job for you if you cannot figure it out.
good,A typical workday at this company consists of testing various samples and inputing data to meet clients standards.
good,"Oxy is a great company for the industry. However, it is very ""stuffy"" and ""old school"" andnot very progressive. Executives actually have a separate elevator than rank and file."
good,So far the process has been frustrating due to lack of information and the impression that Oxy is not invested in the employees that came with the acquisition.
good,"Pros"
good,contract with no opportunity to go permanent even after posting for several internal permanent positions. spoke with district manager and nothing was done about management
good,Oxy is a great company great employees the work area is great. Managing is great as well. Oxy has open a lot of doors for me working with them. I learn new skills.
good,"Solid E&P company located in Houston, TX. Was able to navigate the downturn in the energy industry and seems to have successfully made the transition to a new management team after a proxy fight."
good,"Had personal problems, and missed to much work in 90 days. My mother was sick and then passed away, and after the passing, I came down with pneumonia and had to miss work."
good,If you are looking to get hands on experience then OxyChem is the place to be.  You get the opportunity to learn as much as you can by helping with S/U and S/D.
good,I learned all about the oil/gas industry. I entered data into open wells that was given to me by my supervisors. Overall everyone was great to work with and I enjoyed my time there.
good,"My position at this plant had me ""under the gun"" constantly due to the high risk of emergencies and community impacts. I was relative young in my career and had spent many years in the fire service so the challenge was welcomed at that time."
good,"My experience with Oxy was great overall; the people are generally engaged and great, the work was extremely interesting and the culture was in transition, with HQ having recently relocated to Houston from LA. The corporate team in which I worked was still stuck in their old-school LA mindset - which sounds contradictory in a way, I know, but these individuals were apparently used to being catered to, totally coddled by upper management (CEO), and brooking no new ideas or innovative suggestions. Their every whim obeyed with whip-crack alacrity, and if you suggested even a whiff of change to an existing process or a new approach, a creative solution , it was first beaten down, and then promptly portrayed as their own if it wasn't discarded outright out of fear of change and loathing! This was a terrible but unique situation and my experience with certain individuals turned out to be unexpectedly negative. Unfortunately, they didn't get the memo that Houston is a nice place to work, we are all very supportive of each other and of diversity (in every way, including ideas), and we come to Houston from all over the world to work in the oil industry and other businesses. This team should be replaced with people who really understand the nature and culture of the oil business."
good,Reporting was done on a bi-weekly cycle. I was able to visit the field with several project managers in order to get a better understanding of the projects and how they were progressing. Management was in fluctuation due to restructuring of the organization. Coworkers were good to work with as they were able to help & assist when problems presented themselves. I worked with 1/2 the group at different companies throughout my career. Hardest part of the job was the layoff due to company restructuring. Most enjoyable part of the job was the 9/80 schedule and being in town.
good,Loaded and unloaded Marine Corps equipment on and off the BonHomme Richard-LHD 6 US Navy ship.
good,"Not giving any more ""opinions"".  Not relevant to current job search."
good,I enjoyed paying the different types of invoices.  Everyday was something new and different.
good,mgmnt is lacking people skills. they beleive its my way or the high way lots of overtime  and a lot of inexperienced people mangement kills all moral and expects you to work long hours
good,"I do not want to give a review, but Indeed requires one. Oxy is an average large corporation. It has good points (good compensation) and bad points (swings in oil prices drive the company)."
good,Lots of red tape and slow to respond to outside conditions.Changes can be difficult to effect due to the many layers of management. Overall a stable working environment with opportunity for career advancement.
good,Is a good and interesting place to work but if you don't fit in with the rest they're quick to let you go. It's definitely a learning experience as well
good,"Overall, Occidental is a great company to work for.  It has all of the things a professional working in Corporate America; great work/life balance, 9/80 work schedule, flexible work schedule, laid back work environment, and hands-off management who are approachable if desired."
good,Lots of compositional modeling using GEM for a project in Oman which was completely uneconomic. Any smart graduate would be able to confirm this statement. Project was actual abandoned after I left. Advised extensively on collection of PVT data and experiments. Same for special core analysis.
good,"Nice place to work with good benefits.  "
good,Uncluttered work processes. A very flat organization leads to lack of career growth opportunities. Provides stable job vs a career. High emphasis on being most efficient low cost producer of CA products. Able to work at ones own pace. Minimal oversight from management.
good,"Oxy is a really good company, very employee-friendly and compensation in vacation, salary, bonus and stock is better than any company I've experienced."
good,The company had great compensation but it seemed like everyone was there only for the money. There's a huge possibility for growing in the company but there's not much culture in it. Everyone just goes to work for work and go home right after.
good,"It was a great place to work, then they acquired another company, and changed it all. Management is filled with “Yes Men”. Which is not a good thing for safety."
good,Company itself is great. Half the time the union prevents management and hourly coming to good agreements. Individual supervisors really need to work on people skills.
good,"Average pay, good insurance. Retirement could be better (reason i left). Mostly good people to work with. I enjoyed the job for the most part. I didn’t like the 4 on 4 off schedule."
good,I had a great time working at Oxy.  Unfortunately my assignment ended.  I hope to be recalled for another upcoming project. I worked on the SENM project. Great Experience.
good,"Great Place to work! Friendly coworkers and great flexible schedule. Easy access to the freeway. Great location. Wish it was a perm job, currently working contract only."
good,Good job have leaned new aspects of the oil and gas industry and new programs I previously was unaware of
good,Wonderful environment in the field. Great team of people in all operations departments from permanent employees to temporary contractors. Educational career experience.
good,It was a great company to work for.  They treat their employees very well and generally promote from within.  I wish I could have worked there for a  longer time period.
good,"Big on training young geologists, I felt very supported in pursuing advancement of my geologic understanding. Was able to learn so much from veterans and new geologists as well."
good,"Sometime Oxy management was a little click-ish, and was difficult to start in took time to break the ice.  They are very likely to have extreme ups and downs with the energy business.  They do very will with old fields but do not know how to open a new one."
good,Great place to work. Flexible work hours. Very good group of professionals and very productive. Enjoyed the time spent at Oxy.
good,"Great place to work, good people, great atmosphere, good opportunities for advancement."
good,"Personally, I had a supervisor who taught me more and more about our function in the company until I needed very little supervision from him.  Also, I became very proficient in the various types of software used on a daily basis, which were upgraded every few years.  I developed a reputation of being very accurate and detail oriented.  Being a notary was an interesting and rewarding part of the job."
good,"Good Company To Work With, Work Schedule Was Good, Half The"
good,At Oxy you will have the chance to gain a substantial amount of knowledge about the chemical industry. You will be prepared to make efficient face to face meetings and develop a plan to execute new business.
good,Oxy as a company is fantastic and their culture reflects that. The company offers great benefits and the people you work with are fantastic. There is a diverse group of people on the accounting side. Sure it's cliquish but what major company isn't? Let's be honest if you went to a school with 20k or more people it's second nature to you or should be.
good,Oxy was a great company to start out with to get into Oil & Gas. They were patient and took the time to make sure that I was fully trained before being on my own.
good,Good place to work with good pay and benefits. Plenty of training provided. Limited opportunity for advancement. Less than stellar atmosphere with current oil prices
good,"-Gained experience across a wide range of process equipment."
good,Time spent could be more useful if more training were provided to employees and project management teams. This company did not have the procedures in place for building a solid PMO at the time I was there.
good,"Great place and location to work at, management was great and so were the co-workers. benefits were nice and work balance was fair."
good,"If you like being a cog in the machine with average pay, Oxy is the place for you.  Oxy offers decent benefits and just enough money to keep you from looking elsewhere.  Although I will say I have had excellent opportunities to learn new skills."
good,great people and great skills learned.  culture is easy going with flexibility as long as you get the job done.  great pay and benefits. growth potential for lower level staff
good,Great company to work for! Oxy stresses the importance of collaboration between the corporate office in Houston and the work being performed by technicians in the field.
good,"Oxy EOR is the place to work if you are going to work for Oxy. RBL, a third party company, reorganized the company and did a fantastic job, however, the Resources Business Units wanted to do it their own way and created the worst place to work ever. The morale in Resources is horrible and lead to me leaving the company. HR on the Resources Business Units is strictly there for the management and NOT advocates for the workers. Over-all I love Oxy EOR and the CEO, Vicki Hollab, are the reasons I would look to Oxy as a career. She is incredible and the people of EOR make you feel like part of a family."
good,"Young technical staff, had some great experienced employees as well. Manager changes really affected the team dynamics and the corporate restructuring finally became too toxic to deal with."
good,"Challenging and stimulating environment. Efficient management of capital and people."
good,"Left to go to another company.  Felt a competition environment was created among peers, and that was not comfortable to me. Enjoyed the people and the cultural diversity."
good,"Facilities engineers were given a lot of responsibility.  Productivity demands were high, thus leading to a high-pressure and high-stress atmosphere.  However, the work was rewarding, and the company's compensations were superb."
good,Working in North Dakota was a life long experience profiling horizontal wells talking with bit representatives was a great experience. I would do it again in the summer!
good,Very old school. Top-down management with limited career advancement. Very dedicated management but difficulty with changing management style and keeping up with the millennials.
good,Working from 7:00 AM to 4:30 PM was in a fast path in Occidental of Elk Hills. It's was good to work there due to the company size was big enough to undertake the oil industry downturn.
good,"Good company  to work for, pay is decent. not the best but not the worst. OT shortage because of over hiring. typica work day consists of maint. readings and samples."
good,"Good company to work for. However, when they sold their assets to a smaller company, they paid off the employees who worked there instead of trying to relocate them or move them to a new position., The company they sold their assets to hired the lowest paid employees and laid everyone else off."
good,"Good company, no complaints. Everyone is extremely technically oriented. Safety is the top concern of the company and I felt it was a very safe place to work."
good,"Occidental exceeds in safety, compliance, excellence in work ethic. The company has a stable footing for opportunities & great track record with employees often ensuring lifetime success with most. Educational opportunities are always present & job advancement is normally encouraged within the company structure. Occidental prefers lately to work more with outsourcing to contractor firms for tasks oriented within plant operations, a strong contractor presence is associated with many projects & daily operations. Core positions usually demand high educational qualifications along with rigorous screening for skilled candidates. Opportunities are present at lower positions but usually demand in plant postings for positions or demanding training. Benefits are outstanding if you can successfully get a foot in the door."
good,"While my time at Occidental was short, found the work environment very enjoyable, with support when needed, as i have been working in the lifting and rigging industry for over 30 years i had never worked on the heavy marine engineering, side of things, this is what attracted myself to the position and was not disappointed,but due to the price of oil declining, i was given my notice as there was cut backs on projects that were shelved due to the price of oil."
good,"Great company with good benefits.  In some situations, management will hold you back and expect you to do a mediocre job.  People, for the most part are great.  Downsizing hit many people hard and management was less than helpful."
good,"Overall, it's a good company to work at. Only downside is work/life balance. It is difficult, at times, to spend time with your family and work long hours at work."
good,"Team Lead & colleagues are great"
good,Good company. Pay is adequate (not excellent) with room for promotion. Benefits are affordable and the coverage get for the money is excellent compared to previous employers. Pay is determined by HR and not your supervision. This is their weakest link.
good,"Good work environment and culture. People are always willing to train and help when need. The company promotes a collaborative work environment. Work life balance is great. Great benefit. Overall, a good company to work for."
good,"People were good to work with, good open door policy, the company says it cares about safety and backs it up, would have liked to be able to retire from there."
good,"My experience with Oxy is very old (from the 80's), but it was a great experience and helped shape my career. Company paid for my degree and promoted me a few times."
good,"Fast paced, innovative environment with strategic goals and plans.  Corporation follows mission and communicates progress well to workforce.  Competitive compensation and benefits programs."
good,I only interned here but I did enjoy it. Everyone was very nice and would go out of their way to help me. I was able to find mentors that helped me with non work-specific questions.
good,"Oxy allows people to eventually grow. It provides freedom and flexibility to do your job. Job growth is very slow. Some people wait up to 12 years before being promoted. Salaries are maintained at very low level in the payment range, usually between 20-30%."
good,"Occidental Petroleum offers a fun and exciting work environment."
good,"Sink-or-swim environment. Help and training are there if you need it, but you have to ask. Generally, good management. Often work long hours (50-60 hours/per week), but every other Friday off."
good,Occidental was an amazing work experience allowing me to learn from co workers from all over the world.  It was very interesting to learn different ways of thinking and solving problems.
good,"productive and very good workplace, team effort and feel like I work with big family, learnt good experiences in reservoir , artificial lift and well optimization."
good,"It was good company to work for and utilize your experience and make contribution to the company's goals."
good,"A high paced enviroment with high demands. Ample opportunity to learm"
good,Overall good some lack of diversity training was needed. Management was stiff to adjust to changes in personnel. Who you know and how well you knew what you know. Political in opportunity to advance.  Quality of people were knowledgeable.
good,"The company is great, the atmosphere is great.  Great place to work with awesome pay, and great co workers.  Could not imagine myself working anywhere else."
good,started right out of service liked the people i worked with. was limited turn over but the learning was very valuable in my later career as safety training coordinator
good,Great Hands on experience company; Heavy work load; Great engineering experience; Work culture strives to be collaborative but still has some ways to go in achieving that. Communication of goals by management sometimes gets muddled up with daily busy work.
good,Occidental Oil and Gas is an Independent company where a professional has immense opportunity to grow and contribute. There is very less bureaucracy to hinder work.
good,Too many managers. The company needs to have a flatter organizational structure. It was difficult at times to get work done without obtaining multiple layers of managerial approval.
good,"good job to have people are will help you learned your job "
good,It is one of the fast growing company in the world. This company motto is transforming employees life. Totally 10000 employees working in this company. All employers are equal. There is no partiality. Every quarterly client the company recognize and reward the employees. This office infrastructure is good.
good,"I learned the procedures of oil & gas field working system."
good,Great company to lean the oil and gas industry. All of the team members were very helpful and offered knowledge of the field during my projects.
good,Oxy offers a great opportunity to learn and grow within the organization. I would recommend Oxy to my friends and family. My manager is awesome!
good,"A good company to work for but the parent company wanted to sell off the division I was working in and concentrate on being a petroleum company,"
good,OXY-USA the North American Subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum is a great place to work. Creativity in problem solving is a daily routine. Each day new challenges are presented and individual problem solving and decisions related to work make the environment exciting and challenging each day.
good,"Work is either intense and time sensitive or inactive depending on the hiring season.  Management limits creativity and with work coming in fits and starts, this can lead to boredom. Not someplace i wanted to work long term."
good,"Work life was a lot of working on multiple accounts"
good,"Maybe my first and only corporate exposure I will ever attain."
good,"Oxy, is good caring place to work for the lower management is very caring and helps everyone's needs. Oxy is also very helpful in teaching for people who are wanting to learn."
good,Typical day at work was handling problems that arose in department. Placed purchase orders and bid contracts. Made sure department personnel were trained in safety.
good,"During my short time there, It was very busy with opportunity for many hours of overtime. The job was on a 7 on 7 off shift. When you were on the job it was continual work when you were off they tried not to bother you."
good,"Great place to work , very demanding at times but it’s what you you’re paid to do. I can’t say enough good things about the company ,I learned a lot there and also thought a lot things to my fellow employees"
good,it  was a great company to work for they took care of their employees I liked working for them they  had great equipment it was new and very comfortable once again great company and management.
good,"Good place to work"
good,Good company to work for but salary not the best given the job responsibilities. Role changed multiple times. Work was equivalent to working 3 full time jobs.
good,Excellent professional place to work. Good people challenging and motivating opportunities. Oxy develops your skill set directly relevant to the role given.  i would definitely recommend to anyone.
good,My experience with Oxy has been great.  We have great upper management who acknowledge and appreciate their employees.  They are involved with the company as a whole and are always seen.
good,"Co-workers were polite and helpful. Manager was relaxed and knowledgeable. Good Working environment."
good,"Cool area to work. Met a lot of great guys with years of experience. It was fast paced drilling and we were allowed to change things as we saw fit, which was nice."
good,A very fast pace position that does require a lot of muti-tasking when working in the Accounts Payable side of the company. You will start out as a contract worker and then after a year or maybe even long you will eventually become permanent.
good,"Great company with great benefits. Work was interesting and engaging, there was just a ton of it. Oxy runs a lean headcount, so you'll always be busy working there."
good,"I loved the large company atmosphere and how everything was done in a business-like manner. I had worked before for ""Mom and Pop"" print shops where decisions were based on the owner's whims. This company was very structured and it gave you piece of mind. Our boss was fun loving and open to any problems you might have. Plus her design style matched mine! "
good,"Frac Consultant and Wellsite Manager in charge of 2-4 Workover Rigs plus Rigless Operations on a daily basis, lots of multi-tasking, very detail oriented work when dealing with 4 Workover jobs plus Rigless operations in the same day. Experience with Stimulation, Coil Tubing, Wireline, Testing, Pre-Frac, Frac, Post Frac Operations. Successfully maintaining an incident free safety record while setting benchmark times in Workovers/ Completions. Good Company"
good,I managed the natural gas sales of the company. I was also in charged of the natural gas scheduling. I conducted financial analysis on new business development. Also designed economic models for maximising sales. I learned about the Oil & Gas Industry. I travelled to fields in the south of Argentina and Bolivia. I enjoyed the daily trading of natural gas (spot sales)
good,"o	Managing drilling and completion operations as an onsite 24 hour supervisor."
good,This is an excellent place to work to gain knowledge of the Oil and Gas Industry
good,Very metrics driven organization.  Demanding organization that takes good care of their employees.

good,"OXY definitely provided everything needed for proper work life balance as well as recognition for when you exceeded your goals and KPI's. The negative was at the time i was looking for an opportunity to advance my career, i was informed that i would stay in the same job for some period of time."
good,Improved my interpersonal skills along with my technical skills. Co-workers were very helpful and easy to collaborate with. Changing management structure added confusion.
good,i loved my job. it was fast paced and exciting most of the time. management was a bit difficult and not much room to move around unless you were in a relationship or family with one of the supervisors but it never bothered me or kept me from doing my best. it worked great for keeping bills paid and taking care of my two kids
good,A dynamic international oil and gas company good at utilizing business processes and tools to maximize shareholder value.

good,I was a regional purchasing manager for 8 years. I was located in Burlington New Jersey when the plant there was still owned by Oxy..

good,I worked for Occidental for nearly 20 years and was given outstanding opportunities to develop my capabilities and experience in finance and accounting. I worked with exceptionally talented people throughout my career and cannot say enough about the outstanding people at Oxy!
good,"I went to work for Oxy with a great team of managers. They have a lot of turn over in upper management. The 4.5 years I was there, I had 4 different drilling managers. This made it tough to obtain consistance due to each manager wanting to do something different than the other. The long term employees were always willing to help and were fun to work with."

good,Occidental Petroleum is by far the best company I have ever worked for. The management stresses TEAMWORK and SAFETY... and they truly lead by example. A dedicated and hard working group of people who also seem to do a good job of balancing work with family life.
good,as a pumper in north dakota this is a great job. all the people i work with are awesome and so is the pay. Better management would be better as far as scheduling maintence and different field operations. the only down side is communication amongst the office people. feels like you have to constantly tell 10 people about whats going on so something can happen. overall great place to work! highly suggested
