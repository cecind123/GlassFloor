bad,"Not good hours,not good pay,training does not happen,management usually does there shopping on company time and family is always hanging out at store as well as assistant manager who has his girlfriend's there all the time,not a well managed place e to work"
bad,"Rent-A Center is an awesome company. I just could not continue to lift refrigerators, washers, dryers, and furniture for little to no pay or recognition. There were no off days and the hours were long. I did not have a work and life balance with that company at all. I was often criticized because I was female and the industry I worked in. The management would promise raises and I never got one ever."
bad,"Horrible. Upper management is ridiculous. I honestly would never have returned to work for them, but I needed a job quickly. They own you and not in a good way."
bad,"i honestly would not recommend working for RAC, the pay was not sufficient and the hours were unbearable. Management was unorganized and demanding. I would not recommend working for RAC."
bad,"Worst work environment I’ve ever been at."
bad,"Very unprofessional work place, owner is a cheat and snake. Will try to not pay you what you deserve at every turn. Its a fight to get anything done. Never will work here again"
bad,"Worked here for 15 months and I was injured on the job, due to uniform policy must wear formal shoes at all times (even in snow while moving a couch), you're not aloud to wear sneakers or boots, if caught not wearing uniform well that's a ""strike/demerit"" 3 of those and you get Terminated. I fractured my wrist with a full size washing machine(Maytag) when I slipped in the snow due to improper shoes I had on, instead of winter boots. I called my store manager and explain the situation as I was heading to the E.R. and he expected me to finish the delivery with one hand. After I finished in the E.R.(7hours) the doctor inform not to lift anything with my right hand for two months, once I had this info I applied for workers comp. and was approved after one week. My DM wasn't too happy about paying me workers comp. and one month into workers compensation I received a letter of termination to my address. My mind was blown I never took a day off, never called out sick, and did them the favor whenever asked of me to work at other locations for the day/week when they were short-staffed, and these location were never close in distance I'm talking about 45+ minutes by car(gas not included). I would sue them for wrongful termination but I can not afford the attorneys fee"
bad,They expect you to put the job before you life and health! Not Good! Is forced to use your personal cell phone for work and they dont even compensate you for it!
bad,Pressured daily for unachievable results. Long hours for unsatisfactory pay. Have to go to locations and set up furniture in  inhabitable environment. Routinely berated by management.
bad,Terrible company to work for. They are never satisfied.  Will fire u in a heartbeat they dont care about the employees . Gave them 9 yrs had 1 bad week and the fired me . Terrible upper management.
bad,I was a Sales manager for 2 years at RAC and was told a Store Manager position was going to be mine soon. Never happened! They brought back an employee that quit 4 months prior to the position opening and now the store is in even worse condition! Forced overtime every week due to not hitting a quota on sales and/or credit. Constantly along people that don’t pay there bill or doing home visits and harassing them u til they pay or they were taken to court. The amount of disrespect in the work environment is ridiculous and it’s mainly from coworkers. This place becomes your life so if you have a family DO NOT APPLY HERE!
bad,"I worked here for almost 2 years and management was horrible. I was a Sales Manager and a Credit Manager. They have extremely high turnover rate. If someone doesn't like you, they will get rid of you. I left for a better job. They are extremely worried about numbers and if you aren't performing that week, they will literally transfer you to any store in the district."
bad,"I was very disappointed with this company as to they would also have problems with customers and did not treat there employees right, I left from there because there was to much arguing."
bad,"day starts with calls to people who are late with payments. Then you deliver or pick up furniture (sometimes you have to build furniture it could take a while but they will get mad at you for taking long). if you pick up fridge from customers you have to clean them and they are usually bad and smell rotten yet they make you clean it and then they rent it out again still in bad conditions or roach problems just nasty stuff. they still make you go run people which means you try to get payments at their door or pick up their furniture you finally get back and put notes and clock out. then do everything all over again tomorrow. they pressure to get payments to keep store at a certain percent amd blame you for not reaching percent goal even though most time you cant do anything customers who are bad at paying just wont  nothing you can do about that . they threaten to fire you almsot every week or give you a ""coaching"" stupid stressful for the pay you get. managment it bad."
bad,I just hate it.they lie to the customers and then try to clean it up.and some of the DM's are stuck in the ways and it's the wrong way.again I hate lying people
bad,"Horrible, gerente Ratera hacia contratos Fantasmas y loca tenía problemas de liderazgo, además La distrital era de lo peor"
bad,"THe worst the worst the worst. only cares about sales, not thr people who work there or the people who rent there. Store keep same inventory cant rent oor sell anything. sell things for way to much"
bad,Unprofessional and unproductive. They didn’t care about family time or if you had time off. No verification on rental orders until the product was out the door which is too late
bad,Had worked for a whole year hoping my work conditions would get better I was let down verbally harassed when reached out to HR department no resolution or follow up until I called back was forced to quit a job I actually enjoyed if only it would of been organized.
bad,Daily stress to acquire certain percentages in a shrinking community is stressful. If certain percentages aren't maintained then the manager has to work everyday until 9 PM. Beating up on the people that operate your locations will not achieve any better results. It will only cause them to leave. Many good managers have left in the last year due to unrealistic demands set down from higher up. The only 2 good things are weekly pay and closed every Sunday and major holiday.
bad,Very crooked not a place to work if you want a life or family they try to force you to work on your time unpaid and push you to get bonuses for management while you only receive minimum wage they pressure you for sales and threaten your job for no bonuses or incentive
bad,"Their Mission Statement is an outright lie. They only care about sales, period. I had a decent store manager at the last store I was posted to, but even he cannot stand against this superiors above him. From District Manager and upwards, you are expected to meet their ridiculous sales goals no matter the cost."
bad,Worked for them for 8 years. Company stocks were starting to collapse. So the pressure was on me everyday. Wanted to treat my employees and customers different from when I first started. All about the stockholders not the customers or the employees.
bad,I worked for the company 6 years as an assistant manager. I did my best I overworked myself to get the store management position but it never happened. Upper management is very poor they move up people that don't have the experience or are underqualified to be the store manager. Even though I pulled through many times I was passed on the store manager position 4 times. I saw no advancement from assistant manager and district managers plus hr department never help in situations reported. They just make you look like your in the wrong and drive you to the position in where you don't want to work there anymore. The pay is not worth the turmoil I went through for 6 years. I only lasted that long because I have a family to support.
bad,"The company is great, the ceo is great however the store manager I had was not. She didn’t not preform her duties and abandoned the store while in the middle of a shift. I was left to run the store in my own and then when I repeatedly reached out for help from my district manager was asked for months to just hold out for hope, with no help being sent, until I finally quit."
bad,"By far the worst job I have ever had. The store manager treats his employees like slave. Unrealistic goal, absolutely no family life. 8am-8pm mon-sat."
bad,Horrible work environment. Be prepared to get harrassed daily. The management is gross and lazy. The upper management does nothing to fix it. The company itself is a failure and only hires ignorant humans.
bad,Boss treated employees like trash was a silvery driver for two weeks during that time I was treated bad I quit to stay home and take care of my kids. Easy job
bad,Pls dont work here it's the worst company in the world the hole company prays on poor people who spend a 100 time more the way the companies get it for. They make 3000 for a 200 tv its crazy.
bad,Good management skills is not good operating hours paid time off subs not willing to work with people when it comes to helping out on customers pass select favoritism when it comes to different customer
bad,"I worked here for 8 months and boy an 8 months it was. They expect you to deliver things plus get sales. No that bad, but the manager I had made me on the road 24/7 so sales were impossible. If you are raising a family have fun getting off at 7 during the week and 6 on Saturday. Not for family life. Also I was promised a bonus after being here for 6 months and didnt get it. Would not recommend to anyone."
bad,"Management loves to belittle, talk down and threaten its staff, and Human Resources doesnt even investigate, choosing the side of high management....."
bad,Rent a center does not care for there employees your just a number they do nothing to protect there employees rent a center sucks if married and have kids not the place to work for with a family they say they care about family yes just not yours
bad,"This place was a mess, I would never work here again if you have children, they do not care all they care about you s sales and that’s it, and the dm...."
bad,"The only thing good about this job what the weekly paychecks, you were treated like a child in a daycare here. You weren’t allowed to do the job you were hired for but we’re supposed to to everything else and get fussed at for it . Not worth the headache.... keep looking elsewhere..."
bad,If you do not speak Spanish you will not succeed at this company they don't care if you have a family you're a peon to them you give it all and make you care less
bad,This place is an absolute joke. The hours are horrible the pay is horrible. Your DM is a complete Joke. You complain or ask for a fair wage and they will look for any reason to fire you. Never work here or AcceptaceNow it's a joke. You won't have a life. You won't get a fair wage. The DM will bully you if you don't bow down to them. Their liars. They are pure fraud.
bad,"Fellow employees selling drugs on the clock, while making deliveries or repos. Manager looking other way, due to free drugs. I left due to my safety, afraid of drug fueled/angry co workers, and future workplace violent event."
bad,The advancement in this company relay's on the fact that you need to be related to the district manager. If you do your job right the now managers tend to get mad because you blow up their shady business. This company will continue to loose good employees and money if they continue to keep those in higher-up position.
bad,"There is a lot of shady things that happen with the company of rent a center, the manager only cares about money and himself, even through I was a customer account rep i still did things I want getting paid to do"
bad,"Work load is to much but they won't hire new staff, allow idiots to keep there job there. If you do your job and collect money from ppl who make a complaint you'll get fired. The company values it's customers more than employees. All in all a terrible place to work. I will never recommend any one to rent a center. On a side note you can make a payment late short or just never they won't do anything"
bad,Please do not apply! Not worth any amount of pay the company is full of fraud most employees steal or talk about other stores it’s like high school . No repect for employees you will not be valued and the district manager is biased and has favorites do not waste your time!!!!!!!
bad,This company is by far one of the worst I ever worked for. One of the DM’s is a angry little man that pretends to care but in reality is uncaring and could careless. He will take the word of the worst Customer over his loyal employees. Not investigate one thing to even see if the statements are true. All because they made a complaint . He will terminate you and throw your entire life off track bbecause of a lie
bad,"Feel like I got a head full of gray hair from this place and I’m only 32. Was one of the least favorite places I’ve worked. They couldn’t keep coworkers for longer then 2 weeks and it left me delivering heavy 2-man items by myself. The schedule was a mess, the hours was basically morning to close and every weekend you had to work. Vacations were very restricted and couldn’t be used during holidays I was doing 3 people’s job and being paid 14 an hour which isn’t horrible but my yearly raises were 5 cents at most. So 10 years down the road I’d still be getting 14.50 an hour. This is definitely not a  career worth having for long No room"
bad,My manager who is a female was very racist and sexist store 4553 on the west side of Cleveland horrible work environment don’t work here the district manager is horrible and the store managers are even worst
bad,This is one job I took on and it was not worth it. For this company to have 4 to 5 workers on the store for such high demand of things sucked. Nothing ever got done and was never done right. The company could care less about you personal life of it had nothing to do with RAC they hate when you call out and hate when you take your mandatory days off. You could call in dead and they still expect you to make your shift. It was a horrible experience
bad,"was told my pay would be one rate and started as another. I had to pay for my own uniforms . They were very misleading. Never has enough tools or the correct tools to perform the job and you had to fight to even use them, I started out with a partner and the job was still hard. After a month of being there, he left and told me everything negative about RAC and once they got someone else he was out the door and I found out quickly everything he said was true. They left me to do it all alone I even asked for help and got told no because they didn't want to get dirty. The MAIN problem is management . I had a couple of accidents while working their , one being a work comp case and was pretty much made fun of and got called names and then expected to jump up and start again when I was on restrictions. Customers are rude at times but you have to encounter a lot of filth and bugs and then you are responsible for taking it back and cleaning it to resale!  They are not team players. you are WAY over worked and underpaid. not only would I not recommend them as an employer , I wouldn't be a customer if they gave me the merchandise because i seen where the stuff came from. STAY AWAY!"
bad,"Don't do it!!!!!!!!!!!! garbage company, garbage hours, garbage management, GARBAGE GARBAGE GARBAGE!!!!!!!!!!! Its going into the toilet. You cant stay and drown with a company like this."
bad,"The Rent-A-Center management team at the Wolcott st Waterbury, CT store have no idea what professionalism and excellent work ethics mean. They cheat their customers on the product prices and condition and treat their employees great for the first few weeks but, if you address unethical practices they start to outcast you. You either fall in line or leave should be the motto for their store."
bad,Bad place to work for. Wouldn’t recommend anyone to work here. Treat customers bad. Never motivated. The customers liked me more than the company itself.
bad,Does not care about Employees you are just a number you don’t go anywhere with this company Unless your part of a clique ! Upper Management is horrible and they have Unrealistic expectations for everything .
bad,Manager at the Union City Tn store is the worst manager I have ever worked for. She knows nothing about how to run a business. And feels she can treat her staff anyway kind of way.
bad,Dont do it terrible place to work district manager treats you like a kid  bad place to work They will call you on your day off and demand you come in for some random inventory I will never go back here it's just one big scam charging customers almost double for what it worth
bad,"I worked at RAC for 2 years, I worked up from Customer account representative to sales manager. Working here was the worst job I've ever had! Sales goals are completely unattainable and you are treated like dirt when you dont meet them. I would only recommend working for them if you are in a dire situation and need $ now."
bad,Everything about rent a center is horrible. Poor management. Pay is horrible . Dont care about employees... no work life balance. Rent a center is your life in their eyes
bad,Strenuous work and unprofessional environment. I felt overworked all the time and the management was all over the place. The store and work vehicles/equipment were filthy. They lacked understanding and didn't care about anything else other than getting the job done. They try to treat their customers well but are careless when it comes to employees. I was miserable working there
bad,Do not work here if you have a family and life. They will not work with you on under no circumstances. No opportunity to grow within the company. Very little thinking in their employees.
bad,Do not work for this company. It was the worst place i have worked for. The customer base you work with is not work the time or effort to be successful at the job.
bad,"Most Horrible and most disrespectful place I ever worked. Management is horrific and assistant mangers are the same. They are backstabbing and dont care about you. Long hours, and a lot of lies. Its not a team environment, its more of survival of the fittest. I would not work there, nor would i buy from there. Over priced, and its cheap quality of a product"
bad,it really depends on the location that you are selected to work at some locations are filthy and sleazy some are clean and immaculate but all are ripping off the public
bad,Very hard stressful and competitive. Company put you in danger or harms way. No advancement. Poor Management. Poor culture and environment. Poor work ethics. Long hours.
bad,"This is the worst company you can work for. they set you up for failure and the second you catch on to it, upper management will create a fake scandal to terminate you. Never in my life have I worked for such an unprofessional unorganized company as Rent A Center. Stores are all under staffed. staff is over worked and physically pushed to the limit. customers are rude and can and will pull guns on you or try to fight you because you are doing exactly what upper management is telling you to do. Management doesn't care about anything but their bonuses. The staff work their butts off for a bonus that they don't see a penny of. DONT EVER WORK FOR THIS COMPANY."
bad,Store manager is horrible. Very sloppy. The district manager left me in a situation that was a threat to me and my family. Bonuses are based on how much you can cheat the customer. The company is a fraud. I would look elsewhere for work. Coworkers would come to work reaking of marijuana. They were loud and would curse at people across the store. Very unprofessional all around.
bad,"i didnt like working here i didnt like management, wasnt an easy place to work, traning was all over the place nobody was a directed trainer. so if you messed up management blamed you and didnt realize there was no proper training"
bad,The most challenging part of the job is overcoming past due accounts    issue to keeping up to date. The most enjoyable was to help them resolve their accounts.
bad,"I know people who work for the company in different places and they really enjoy it. But in the area of Wilmington, Leland etc... I would stay FAR away. Upper management is horrible, and will lie to get whatever they want."
bad,The only good thing i can say about the company is my employees were terrific!! Management micro managed everything that was done daily. Bonuses were a joke and being on salary i worked well over 80 hrs a week
bad,"i wont work for them or do businesses with them  ,i dont recommencement to any one , its crazy hours , unclean stores "
bad,"Long hours and increase pressure on getting deliveries make it a toxic environment. Unethical practices happen frequently, they harass customers  how are late."
bad,"The district manager for my area, made continual advances at female employees. He remains at Rent-A-Center. Need I say anymore? Any employee who quit work due to unsafe working atmosphere collected unemployment. It was unrealistic to think that you could live your life outside of Rent-A-Center. I am more than willing to put my name out there if anyone would like to contact me in regards to Future employment there"
bad,"What can I say about RAC? For starters, if you have aspirations of having a family, social life or further schooling forget about it. The job frequently requires you to work 10+hour days and 45-50 hr weeks. They love to make you feel bad if you cannot work extra OT and make you feel like less of a team player. Who wants to put in so much extra effort for $12/hr? No one and that's why new hires only lasted 1-2 months at RAC. As a Customer Account Rep you're job is harass people who are 1+ days past due by calling three times a day and running their accounts in person which is embarrassing. The employees at RAC really think they're helping customers by overcharging them hundreds to thousands of dollars over what they can buy the item for at Walmart or Best buy. "
bad,"a toxic environment where if you do not fit in you will be set up to get fired, they behave in a manner that is very childish and they live in a world where its an eye for an eye, if you love your life do not work there"
bad,spent too long here working stupidly long days to make near not enough money for the type and amount of work they ask you to do  would not recomennd at all
bad,I worked for the company for 2 years and left once a better opportunity presented itself. The company doesn't follow any of the training videos and the interactions with customers was always less than pleasant.
bad,Rent A Center is probably the worst managed i've worked for. My staff was great to work with besides the manager and district manager. A few of the employees i've worked with recently quit the company after stating issues we had with the store manager not performing his duties as our manager to our DM. In Both situations we gave our DM a Heads Up on the treatment we were receiving from our manager. He never resolved the issue he just made more tension in the work environment.
bad,As a sales manager I never had the opportunity to make decisions or changes to better improve the sales at the branch I was working at. The store manager was closed minded and was discouraging and over worked associates as well as setting unrealistic sales and calls. A horrible place to work.
bad,"The most enjoyable part of the job is going home. You Consistently will be hurting from ridiculous deliveries. As a CAR you will spend your day running around trying to keep up with all of your responsibilities. The customer base for the majority of the part is completely rude. You will be exposed to people's living situations and some of them are less than desirable, many have bed bugs, lice roaches, and are poorly maintained. They do not care about the employees they only care about the numbers. Do not work here."
bad,"Poor management. Same as aforementioned, discrimination based on religious beliefs. I wouldn't recommend a dog working at that place. Doing more work and not equal pay"
bad,"Start of day on list of phones to call."
bad,"Do not work for this company, the pay balance between people is terrible. And when you ask for more money they'll get an attitude about it.   You will work till 7pm every night, don't expect to get off early.  The raises are terrible if you can get one due to their unrealistic standards.  If district manager doesn't like you for any reason don't expect to go anywhere in this company.  They will lie to you to keep you working here.  The store managers are shady and your coworkers that have been working there a while are just as bad. Most store managers will have their favorite employees and if you're not it, you are doomed.  You will go into the nastiest houses, bed bugs, roaches etc.  Do not waste your time coming here, this company is getting bought out and many of the stores will be closing.  The management will micromanage you to death.  Rent-a-Center is a joke bottom line.  Do not work here!"
bad,"Over worked under paid, very little training. Culture was cut throat hardest parts are the hours enjoyable part was when you got off. I would not suggest this to anyone."
bad,"this customer sells you hollywoods stories but at the end do not deliver as promise, under paid and overworked is not a place i will recommend no time for malily"
bad,I would do all I could to do my job correctly and the manager was still never happy with any ones job performance.  She never helped us when we needed help
bad,"They never told me all the job completely inteled, was the worst job ever. I was being harassed and they didnt even defend me, they allowed it to go on."
bad,Como puede ser posible que te digan! Bienvenido al ultimo trabajo de tu vida? Bienvenido a la mejor empresa? Cuando tienen un gran deficit de trabajadores y una constante entrada y salida de estos!
bad,work to many hours and constantly chasing accounts for money. not a safe environment when you only have one driver and going to the worst parts of town and have to be watching your back
bad,I have no excuse for taking his job only regrets. if you are a people person this job will suck the life out of you. company is only interested in the bottomline not the customer.
bad,"This company was very poor at providing instruction, assistance in moving heavy equipment by yourself, and the vehicles were always in bad repair.  Many of the customers were in low income areas, and their housing was difficult at times to get to by yourself with awkward heavy loads."
bad,The work days were long pending if you met credit scores. You were basically responsible for making adult pay their rental bills.  customer talk to you like trash.
bad,i had a bad experienced by the company.  felt at one point  not fair treaded  even i was the bilingual and the biggest market of rent a center is actually hispanics.
bad,"Worst place to work at. Coming from a management position, to working in a place where all you see was preferences on who can do what. The ones who been there longer get the easy jobs."
bad,stay away from here horrible work ethic no work life balance management is very pushy all they care about is results no matter the cost extremely stress full and some time dangerous when out in bad areas at night doing collections
bad,"Two weeks in with this company, one week of computer training and the other was just a joke. Had one nice day where the atea director was showing how to improve sales and that was it. I would not recommend working for this company."
bad,So the company was a good place fun/ great work group. Then got a new store manager and everything when down hill. He got everyone fired and eventually he also was let go... poor company decision to promote this person. Ended with a whole store losing there jobs...
bad,Had zero flexibility. No remote working allowed. Very manager centeric and no decision making authority. not very exciting to work here. latest technology used
bad,This can be a fun fast paced environment but extremely stressful dealing with the collection side. Replevins are done often for the dishonest customers.
bad,"Rent A Center has an admirable mission statement however, they do not put it into practice. You are expected to meet daily goals that are only attainable when you are fully staffed. Try managing a store with just 2 other individuals (sometimes just yourself), while having to do collections, outbound deliveries, inbound receiving deliveries, sales calls, report filing, process applications, hiring, firing, disciplining, customer service, point of sale and handling complaints etc. IMPOSSIBLE!"
bad,"The corporate culture is predatory.  The regional VP's down to the District managers are total jerks.  They must have a class to teach them to behave this way.  The customers who steal from the company are treated better than the employees.  "
bad,"Filthy work environment and total disrespect buy all upper management.  Customers and houses were disgusting, constantly threatened by customers and no support by management, all about the money."
bad,"I worked here about 6 months the only reason I was able to last that long was because they worked with my school schedule but at the same time they also complained about me going to school ore then working and since I was part time I had no benefits so when I threw out my back I was out of school and work for a week because I had no coverage, they had me do 2 man delivery's by myself almost all the time and we were suppose to close at 6 but while they went home on time they sent me to a far place and I ended up not getting off till 9."
bad,I sold to low income families with bad credit. I felt like I was ripping customers off even though I explained to them their contract. I did not feel good about my job and management made it worse.
bad,"There are so many negative things I can put out there in regards to the company, but I rather not. All i can say is as a sales manager, you are treated poorly."
bad,Rent a center expects you to be there all the time almost every day and most of the time they ask you to work your days off they are not family friendly and they are not understanding
bad,"Too many unethical practices. Too much competition within the company, no team work environment, it's every man for themselves. Not a pleasant environment to work in."
bad,"Did not enjoy working here , the management was horrible, lack of professionalism, bust you butt to get sales no commission. Must collect on the accounts and deliver"
bad,Don't recommend  working for a company that takes financial gain over people with little to no money. this is not the kind of company that promotes a positive healthy mental or physical culture
bad,all about the money did not care for any of their workers no rewards or anything of the nature just shut over work yourself and get your hours cut. the customers were the only thing that'll make you smile about the job
bad,terrible management delivery driver is expected to do all the work while most of the time management played games and was on facebook on personal cell phones pay is terrible and only part time with no benefits at all
bad,fast food workers make more. odd hours and very rude customer base.Constant collection calls and repo runs. morening to night shift just to get the hours
bad,"It depends on who you work with.  My manager was horrible & treated me like a slave.  It's too much stress, too much pressure to close credit on Saturdays & too much work for the little pay that we receive."
bad,"this was an ok job when on the truck, but the management was poor and were quick to push their work off on to another associate. Not the best job or company I have worked for"
bad,I enjoyed working with some of the employees but the management their was poor.  She only thought about herself and how much bonus she would be getting each month.  She always pointed fingers at someone to blame for everything.
bad,"Rent A Center is on of the worst companies in my opinion to work for. The company is tailored to attract single mothers with limited income. They put them in these crazy contracts then chase them down for either a payment or recovery of merchandise. If you could understand the condition of most families, you would understand the condition of the furniture recovered, refurbished and re sold."
bad,"Awful working place, being a PDS Is being the slave of the place don’t do it. Always make you deliver furniture and items by yourself even if upstairs they have no  sympathy for your time your taking delivery a washer and dryer up 4 flights of stairs they will call you and ask what’s taking so long when no one else in the building will lift a finger to help you."
bad,They need a clean up in management . Need to pay employees for overtime instead of cutting their hours at the end of the week. Also the district manager there only cares about his numbers and not well being of staff.
bad,Rent a center wants your life to be all about work. You have to work long hours  usually from 8am to 9pm daily. Never get a full weekend off. You have no time at home with family. Training is not existences. Conflicts in the work place are pushed to the side or not handle at all. Calling in to co-worker relations to report something only gets you demoted. Sexually harassment is allowed. No place for a woman. New hires make more then employees that have been there for years.
bad,Horrible management lack of communication did the something everyday the hardest part of the job was dealing with management and collecting payments manager wouldn't allow us calling certain people because they was her family members or friends so she would call them when she felt like it or when we really needed to hit our numbers I learned how to install washer and dryers stoves televisions the most enjoyable part about the job was delivering customer stuff such as furniture or appliances etc
bad,not a good place to work at limited to no advancement under paid and overworked little to no family time. must be a people person and know how to deal with rude people on a daily basis
bad,If you enjoy repossessing Peoples Furniture having guns pulled on you and having to argue and fight and track people down then this is the job for you it's not for the friendly
bad,"dont work here the company offers very little to make it worth the time and effort to stay in the job, they take so little care of the workers its amazing they still have a company"
bad,"70+ hours a week mandatory, got 1 pay raise the whole time. a cold heartless company that only cares about its precious numbers. could never get approved for time off or a vacation. written up up for taking paid sick day. i hated this job"
bad,"Management does not care about your life outside of work, Will have you work ridiculous hours, but then turn around and argue that we have too much overtime. Some days we would have to be short staffed just because others were close to over time. "
bad,Very poor management and no organization. Never leave at the time you are supposed to and the schedule of deliveries was always packed and then we are expected to stay over if something is not completed.
bad,"Workplace Culture is very stressful"
bad,Poorly managed a lot of illegal work laws are broken and nothing done when addressed to corporate. Only issues addressed are when a mistake is made on employees end
bad,My manager was a pervert who tried to abuse us. They didnt treat us fairly and managers were inappropriate. They would make me carry heavy things even though they knew i couldnt since i was pregnant.
bad,Poor management. Store manager only cared about his next day off and next vacation. I was personally passed up for a promotion twice. Store manager doesn’t care about you or your family despite being told that it is a family friendly place to work. Was told to promote benefits for customers that they didn’t need or want just because if we hit a certain percentage the store manager got a paid day off. No incentive for employees to make sales
bad,Very poor morale within company. Unprofessional. Favoritism is a very big problem within company. You perform well 3 weeks straight and get a pat on the back. Your numbers slip by 0.1% above company avg one week and your getting a confidential office meeting with your store manager.
bad,"this Job is a customer service call center, very stressful and demanding, Manager was very unfair and not very friendly, the hr were okay but working Saturdays was not fun"
bad,Store manager is lazy while taking all credit for sales and  being rewarded with bonuses and trips while hourly employees are given no incentive to maintain or increase sales. Store manager is still there and will stab anyone who is a threat in the back while smiling to their face. DM knew of store managers behavior yet did nothing to correct it.
bad,Had to many issues it's not about what u did today it's about what u doing tomorrow. Great numbers don't mean nothing threaten to get fired alot and no raises at all. Just stressed place to work at the time
bad,another review that is not applicable because I dont give a rats a** about the company or anything else to do with it for that matter.just stop asking for f***ing reviews
bad,I would personally never go back to RAC after being there 8 years+ but it did give me a chance at getting my first management role. The work/life balance is non existent. If you have a family I would stay away.
bad,Would not recommend anyone working here. Very stressful  job. Was called diragtory name by management and filed claim with Eeoc. Very cut throat job. Manager makes employees almost do illegal actions to receive our property back
bad,"long hours, no work life balance the pay was below par the job duties are so not worth the pay most customers would never return working out in the elements and the uniform was horrible by the way you buy your own uniform"
bad,"manager would come in hung over/still drunk and sleep it off on display beds. manager would throw you under the bus for any mistakes made in the store, and frequently take credit for your accomplishments."
bad,Delivery driver installer loader and unloaded assembly products in home and installer responsible for customer service and support contracts with the customers taking payment in store
bad,"they treat women with no respect, they dont pay well, they work you to the core, no days off if your a salary employee. they are UN organized and there furniture is disgusting they do not follow proper health codes on cleaning the furniture and it has bed bugs and all types of roaches. very poor management, I wouldn't recommend this work place to anyone"
bad,This company only cares about the collection of the money or merchandise. Does not care if you are on the road knocking on people's doors at nighttime to collect moneys or merchandise. It's dangerous but it paid the bills. STRESSFUL
bad,Not enough credit given to the employees on the ground making all the money for the company. I would not go back if asked to. Could be a good job for someone with no family.
bad,"Worked there for 7 years.  Was even a presidents trip winner.  But the business sucks, the upper managerment sucks.  I hated every minute of it.  I stayed so long only because I excelled at the position."
bad,"This place absolutely ruined my life. I may have only been a part time employee, but I was given the short end of the stick constantly. Unless you are a full time employee don't expect any of the managers to care about you as an employee even the tiniest bit. Oh, and the hours even for part time are absolutely terrible. Even if there's a million things in store for you to do and the back room looks like a tornado came through and destroyed everything and left it all behind and needs to be taken care of, don't expect them to let you work extra time to take care of those things. I wouldn't recommend working here to my worst enemy."
bad,"Rent a Center is all around a bad place to work with terrible management, and cut throat corporate members. The clientele is absolutely terrible, and makes the job so much worse. The job comes with plenty of room to grow, but with little pay raise, and twice the responsibilities."
bad,"Each location is different but direction still falls on upper management. Slow growth, low pay and especially no work life balance. Will make you stay late up to 9pm doing collection calls if you don't hit your goals."
bad,"Had to work average of 60 hours a week, understaffed with the ever lasting promise for advancement that had no opportunities in sight for the future."
bad,"Terrible work culture, terrible business model, terrible management, long hours, low pay, high turnover, stressful environment, patronizing incentivation. Stay away from this company."
bad,I did not enjoy working here. I was targeted for being the only women in this store location. I would not recommend it to anyone just because the management didn't care enough help me and instead attacked me for being a women.
bad,Demanding for sales for a program that is not the easiest thing to sell. Management using negative comments for motivation.  Management with unrealistic goals and expectations
bad,I dislike this company they do not care about there employees hard to get any raise no bonuses and the manager does nothing about problems need better management and pay
bad,Very unprofessional. Co workers there are very great people but the management treat part time very low. Fulltime people just sit inside their office unless theor pushed around.
bad,"They work their employees hard, when there is a holiday, you dont get your typical designated day off because of the holiday.  I would not recommend working here."
bad,"look unless you want to be treated like you are todo everything under the sun while they are stuffing their mouths with food, not everywhere is like this but Pawnee and Broadway is. they cant keep help because they wont train anyone."
bad,"This is a company focused on serving a very specific type of customer. Ones that other companies will not deal with generally. You have to become an adult babysitter and chase weekly goals that are set at a company standard, no matter what the circumstances. You are forced to work late when your customers are past due, it doesn't matter how hard you work, if the customers are not paying, you pay the consequences. The work conditions are generally filthy, business practices suck, and advancement in the company is very strongly based on who you know and a little luck in the numbers of things. The company itself has a poor stock value and is making panic reactions to such in hopes to keep the lights on. Investors are leaving for a reason, and if you had 401k investment the company by default, you lost a lot of money over the past two years."
bad,"This company is greedy and doesn't care about their employees. The benefits that the company selects are high in deductible, and high in cost. You have wrong long hours with low salary."
bad,"Manager was literally drunk everyday, and no one from corporate would do anything about it. Pay isn't worth it and the benefits are a joke, as well as the schedule."
bad,They were extremely unprofessional. I learned a lot of bad habits there. The treat customers horribly with attitude and intimidating them in to getting in contact with them or paying. The would harass customers they know are passed due on there accounts. They would send me as far as to there job. They would even take back furniture that is disgusting full of roaches and sell as new.
bad,I would never work here again. Its horrible from the pay to the management it was my worst experience for a job they dont care about your personal time at home
bad,Working at Rent-A-Center there is no real work/personal life balance.  if collection standards are not being met you are expected to say hours past your scheduled shift harassing customers into paying.
bad,"The rent a center in yonkers on 490 south broadway is terrible, the manager will try to get you fired if she doesn't like you.  She'll talk behind your back and not be a mature person and say things to your face.  She will favor a certain employee over anybody in the store.  Once you step foot in the happy energy you have will be gone."
bad,"You will have no time with your family if you work for this company.  They only care about the bottom line and you hitting your goals, that you were forced to come up with, even though you knew they were unattainable.  Then you are just a piece of trash cause you can't hit your goals."
bad,At the ashland ohio location I worked for 6 years where this company let the store manager steal from the safe even though he was caught on camera. He would take people's rental agreements down and retype them and not reinstate people where they left off so the owed more money. I worked every Wednesday by myself with no lunch break.. and the company will not reimburse me for anything.. this company makes you work long hours 8am to 9pm sometimes per the district manager earl McDonald.. this company is based on hiring their friends and not promoting people who deserve to be promoted.. and they wonder why their business is going under .. the ashland location is on its way to close bc they consistently lose money hand over fist .. don't work here this company destroys you physically and mentally..
bad,"Chaotic and disorganized. no training offered. poor management skills and a low paid highly stressful work environment. NOT RECOMMENDED. No people or service skills. Verbally Abusive of staff. Trys to lure customers and rip them off. The pay is sub-standard. No breakroom, Lunch time off not granted on several days."
bad,Told to get credit to goals yet sales aren't verified and qualified for good sales. Seen District Manager be completely disrespectful and micro manage store managers. Store managers are self serving and deceitful. Management is rude and unethical and immoral.
bad,"they use you as they see fit they make you pick up the slack of the lesser employees, the pay is terrible, they rush you and call you constantly that's why I quit. I don't recommend anyone applies unless you don't have a life and you want to belong to them"
bad,"They do not care about you or your health."
bad,Was a awful experience. Managers or employees do not receive good pay the labor is extensive if you are not properly staffed the upper management do not look our for employees.
bad,"Easily the worst place I have ever worked. If you have a family, or anyone that spends time with you after hours, you will not see them."
bad,Especially this location management is a back stabber if your not in the inner circle (smokers) will not work with your schedule. Company is broke. Managers think they can do whatever they want. Please be aware....
bad,"This job was very stressful, but not due to the work that had to be done but it stressful because of the people i had to work with. They were very unorganized and dysfunctional."
bad,"save yourself the time dont work for rent to own companies such as this, the idea is good but the politics in the back are not worth it, lower income people are targeted and exploited with fees"
bad,When you work at rent a center you work hard to reach certain goals and get no reward but guess who reaps all the benefit the store manager and anybody higher then the store manager. Most of the managers will walk on you to make themselves look better in front of the higher ups.
bad,I started as a CAR in december 2015. I was number one in the region on closing daily credit on my route. I was eventually promoted to Credit Manager. I wss in that position for a few months then transferred to ky. When RAC screwed me and terminated me illegally without pay. So i hope this company goes bankrupt and eats dirt
bad,This job is very time consuming. You work practically all day for a decent pay if you're single and share bills. The management can be inconsiderate and very unprofessional at times. This is considered a temporary job.
bad,"unorganized, good company just needs the right people to run it that is all I have to say but overall  it is a good company. I met some good people while working there"
bad,I had to stay with this job for 6 years because I needed it. But I did not agree with the company. They over price the products and they don't care about their employees. Work here if you don't care about a social life.
bad,long hours working on weekends and dealing with a lot of crazy customers and working conditions at night. but if you need a temporary job I guess this will do.
bad,"This a boys club for real and made me as a woman feel like I was never good enough to work there, the environment was hostile and the compensation was low."
bad,most stressful job ever no communication between management. they are all about numbers and do not care about staff. they will keep rerenting product that has more than double been paid off. take advantage of those who have no credit.
bad,Unprofessional work environment.  Not able to grow with in company. Not many opportunities for pay increase. Under payed for the amount of work required.
bad,Terrible staff I worked there for 7 months and was the main delivery driver and finally had to quit because EVERYONE is out to get you and the management is terrible. The job is a joke to many good workers have quit this job because of the management and the staff. You WILL be set up for failure if you get this job.
bad,"Low pay, no benefits, customers were mostly rude, co-workers were very unprofessional, work was laborious and unsafe, demands of collection counts were unreasonable or unrealistic."
bad,This company is TERRIBLE. If you have a family you will never seen them. Pay is not enough considering what you deal with on a daily basis unless you're lucky enough to work in nicer areas. I constantly had to call corporate on management and even had the district manager tell me (after I had been hospitalized for a couple days) that maybe I needed to go because some people can't handle that job!! This was after we had been through so many store managers at that point to the point where I felt like I was having to run the show... horrible horrible horrible you couldn't pay me enough to ever work here again....
bad,The job itself wasn't bad. What was bad was the other workers and the managers. I was sexually harassed and they made me feel like I was stupid if I asked questions. Even when I was working quietly I would be harassed. I was the scape goat and the one they constantly joked about. Would not recommend working here unless you like being degraded.
bad,"They pay very little the work is not hard but, the goals are not realistic. There is some under the rug racisms in the upper management. Be prepared to possibly be held up when delivering their goods."
bad,You'll be dealing with people who will be unable to make payments and when they don't pay it is your fault even though you didnt aprrove them for the contract the computer did. DM is a bi-polar. you'll be doing other stores work because they cant keep anyone at any store in the district. You work 50 hours a week...no weekends off.
bad,This place sucks they say you are responsible for one thing and in turn you are told to do everything in and out side the store. you have to go out on the truck and delivery and install the product along with driving and calling 300 plus people to collect payment and they also want you to hit a sale goal everyday and yell at you when you can not do all this in a 7 hour day.
bad,Rent a Center is not a place you want to be if you have any sort of family or significant other. There is no work/ life balance and knocking on people's doors at 9 pm for credit runs is borderline harassment.
bad,management was good just at the time i work for the company i needed better co-work to work with i work hard for this job can i was not happy.
bad,"Approving customers for purchase lease agreements by verifying customer information, managing customers accounts, filing paperwork, taking payments, writing and sending certified letters, making collection calls, data entry."
bad,"Store manager I worked with was wonderful very rare for RAC, the issue was the DM who talked dirt behind your back and talked about other employees. Structure was bad sadly and no matter how much you tried to turn the store around it wasnt good enough.  You were treated like you never did any work when all we all did was busy our butts."
bad,"Working for this place is a complete joke. They have zero respect for women that work there. The rules only apply for some not everyone. The management there is a joke, if you likes high school you would love working here."
bad,no time for yourself kiss your personal life goodbye. poor management as well. and don't promote within.just a terrible place.cant believe I wasted my life there..
bad,"Hauling steel for Latrobe steel, working for Ryder. Beware that they hang you out to dry in a moments silly day for anything. The safety guys an a**. Never see wage advertised"
bad,"The work is unforgiving and your just a number . They don,t care about you or your family and injury is common place . The managers can be over zealous at best."
bad,"They don't care about the employees at all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
bad,I learned that you will be sold down the river by every co worker because everyone is afraid of losing there jobs. Everyone is afraid of losing there jobs because of the unrealistic sales and collection goals. Of course sales are going to go up and down and of course people pay like #$@# their because credit is not checked. People who use rent a center for stuff are not worried about paying on time because they are at rent a center. If you work their prepare your self for a very boring job with low pay and the same people past due week after week. Yeah you can go pick there stuff but then get yelled at for losing a customer. The management in the Peru IL store are horrible people and should not be running a business.
bad,really really really long hours. management is bad and unfair with employees. management treats customers really bad. furniture infested and broken.
bad,"Overall you will have no life.. no time for you or your family, hours worked will not pay out at the end. they say they care but at the end, they save their butts before you. they expect way too much for no training what so ever, they have poor management and will not listen to you if you have a concern, on a personal level there is a better chance for you to get paid better with far less work involved. "
bad,"Horrible place to work for. No work and life balance what so ever and any idiot can be a manager for this company. A typical day at work would be entering at 9 am and leaving at 8pm after dealing with senseless meetings a lot of unrealistic sales goals by upper management, handling delinquent cases and in court."
bad,I worked for this company for a year as an account manager and the expectations this company put on me was by far unfair. I would be the main worker out on deliveries all day and picking customers payments or furniture up then I would get written up because I wasn't meeting sale quotas every week . In which case the managers were fully aware of this and looked at me like  sry but your out of luck and I never was in the store to focus on sales. This company is b.s and will have you working all day for little pay.
bad,"I would never recommend working at Rent-A-Center. Their poor business practices and lack of enforcement of safety rules make for a hostile work environment. The managers often see other employees as lesser people, and say as much during their conference calls. Proper training for delivery 'specialists' is not provided, leading to injuries and damaged merchandise/customer property. In short, it is a terrible place to work."
bad,If you value your time and professionalism then stay the heck away from this company. I'd work at McDonalds and 3 other part-time jobs before working here again.
bad,"a typical day at work includes being bombarded with work that is put on a daily delivery planner. once you do all the work on the delivery planner you may end up having more work to do that was not on the daily delivery planner because your supervisor has made a promise to a customer that he didn't tell you about or he has just forgotten to put it on the planner. you have to call grown people and try to get them to pay for sub par merchandise. you may get cursed out by these customers, no matter if you are nice to them or not. they will talk crazy to you because they haven't paid their bill like it is your fault that they haven't paid. your supervisors don't see you as anything but an expendable piece of machinery to be used and put away as they see fit. the hardest part of the job is trying to fit French door refrigerators in a duplex in the worst part of town. the coworkers are alright, it is just the supervisors that you have to watch out for because as I said they do not care about you or your wellbeing, they only want you to make as many deliveries as they can squeeze out of you. I have learned that the only way to advance your career with Rent-A-Center is to not work for Rent-A-Center."
bad,"I've had to travel and over all the 16 cities in Mexico, I managed over 167 employees over all. I was the Negotiator and Problem Solver for our Company. Responsible for the High Rate Percentage on our Accounts per month to month basis. Did a lot of project planning for every new account that we opened for the project, was the middle man of this business and made sure we were at the win for profit at all times. Negotiating and Dealing with contractors is the most fun part of my job,"
bad,they arent nice treat you like poo bums work here huge turn over nobody stays for long they talk to you rudely yell at each other and the company is basically for low grade trash who cant get loans for anything DONT DO IT
bad,"me dolio dejar esta empresa pero era demasiado el abuso laboral que sufri por parte de los jefes quienes a su vez culpaban al corporativo al parecer todo al llegar un mexicano a estar al frente de esta empresa en mexico."
bad,"They use you and abuse you.....account reps have to collect money from past due customers,deliveries,pick ups,sales,and work on the store for 10.25 an hour while the sales assistant gets 12.00 dollars to do sales??and even if you go to a house infested with bedbugs and roaches they make you pick it up."
bad,"17-22 hours a week for delivery drivers,when others in the store get much more. Mgr expects one person to deliver by their self. Sorry, but I don't make enough to get hurt."
bad,i would never recommend this place for someone to work. you work 12 hour shifts and it is very difficult to get time off work.
bad,this company doesnt care about people or family it is a game of numbers and who you can get over on with the management i worked for i would recommend this job to nobody
bad,I was never able to take a brake and I was constantly told that I would get fired if I didn't work fast enough. They fired me because I told them I had a doctors appointment  and I told them three weeks in advance.
bad,"ridiculous work based on renting appliances, living room set and bedroom sets. Rent a center takes advantage of morons who do not understand that if you save your money you can buy cash instead of paying triple it's value. Employees are constantly hounded because of non paying customer's who are the scum of the earth when it comes to paying their bills on time."
bad,"Management at the fort hood st location is horrible. Im having to work from 9am until 8:30 every night. I have 3 kids and no time at home with them. He's constantly talking about everyone behind their back and threatning jobs. I've had to call corperate because of some of the inappropriate comments he has made toward me. There is absolutely no team work. They dont even take the time out to train correctly, then get upset when I have tried to figure it out on my own. Trial and error is how I have learned. That and the Delivery guys showing me the right way to do things. I have been there January and I'm still figuring some things that I should have known from the beggining because no one ever took the time to train me correctly"
bad,"no work/life balance."
bad,I was told I needed to find out what was more important work or school. The manager would not work with me so I could also attend class. He was also more into the female coworker more than myself. I did like being able to intereact with customers.
bad,My co workers were wonderful to work with and the most enjoyable was when this was a franchise owned company. The company itself was difficult when having to do collections in Saratoga but on a great summers day was very good to get and enjoy some sun outside.
bad,"schedule was changed every day."
bad,Productive and busy work day. A learning environment. Friendly and dedicated customers. Management could have been better as far as managing the staff.
bad,"worst job i have ever had, overworked and under paid.  no job security, terrible management from store manager all the way up to regional manager. everything is your fault when the store numbers go bad, working conditions are terrible you ether work in bug infested office to the unsafest places in the area of your store.no one can be trusted everyone will throw you under the bus, no one has your back and will let you out to dry."
bad,"Existe la monotonía en su totalidad gracias a la Gerencia, ya que el trabajo es multifuncional, ademas no existe una toma de decisiones adecuada, carecen de liderazgo las sucursales, al menos de donde yo estuve laborando."
bad,Very poor company to work for. Poor management and absolutely no respect for one another. I was very happy to be able to leave this company. Would not suggest anyone work for therm
bad,Goal driven people pleasing atomsphere with store level personal going above and beyond job expections great chance to work with customers
bad,Couldn't stand the hours. No Saturday's off. Late hours. People I worked with was punks
bad,"Rent A Center does not care about their employees. They make you stay past time your scheduled shift, then on Friday make you take a 4 or 5 hour lunch because you are over your allotted hours. The way the company has set up the rules, you will never clear your credit or make enough sales."
bad,your day starts off with past due calls then straight in to deliveries and pick ups. the deliveries have to be done in the harsh cold snow and in the hot summer.
bad,hated being there every second of the time i was employed. management was a joke and unless you were a butt kisser you arent going to get promoted. I got a spine injury and was released because of it.
bad,Not a good place to work at all. they put you in harms way by having you coolect on account`s late at night in bad locations.
bad,They teach you to lie to customers then dont have your back when situations occur
bad,"I worked for RAC for 4 months, and everyday was hastle just to convince myself the poor management and back breaking labor was worth it. I live in Greenfield and was told I couldn't work at the Greenfield location because I'm black, and the people in Greenfield wouldn't like it. The managers are terrible and don't care about they're employees well being at all. I was barely trained on how to do anything, then criticized for it. The interview was at the Greenfield location, and I was also hired there but never actually worked there. I was then told I'd be working somewhere in Indianapolis. After 2 months at one location, without ANY kind of warning, they transferred me to another store of THEY'RE choice. I was transferred AGAIN without any warning just after 2 Months at the new location, which was further away. They basically get you in, then do whatever they want with you if THEY feel it's necessary and will benefit them and the company... Not you. The pay is too low for the tasks required. The customer base was horrible when I was hired on and they expect one to jump in and save the company, which will never happen. Lunch break was whenever it was convenient for the managers. Just all around terrible!"
bad,I would not recommend this employer to anyone. You have to have no personal/family life to work here. I would never work for this company again.
bad,Not a place anyone wants to work. There is no concern for home life or concern for customer base. Numbers and money are the only thing this organization cares about!
bad,"No life outside of RAC, not possible working 11-12 hr days. Management is ridiculous and very unprofessional, talk bad about you behind your back to co workers, exclude you from ""fun"" things in the office, very dramatic silly things that you wouldn't expect from a 20+ year manager. Hardly any training, once you start doing things on your own you are expected to know everything and know how to do it correctly without help or guidance from manager. The list goes on and on..."
bad,"Understaffed, overworked, and underpaid. The typical store is understaffed by about two employees and the manager is always expected to pick up the slack."
bad,"Worked awful hours .. Until late @ night in a bad area. Management didnt care about the staff only hitting the weekly  number and bonus. Store could be full of people but no one would get up to help ... "
bad,"You will spend most of your time chasing customers with delinquent accounts.  You will spend the rest of your time trying to convince new customers to ""buy into"" the rental program.  The company tries to deceive customers into thinking accounts are loans.  They are expensive rental programs which forces people to pay 4 times more than the product is worth.  There is a lot of pressure from higher ups to collect on past-due accounts and acquire new customers.  Store Managers and District Managers have a high turnover rate.  The pay rate does not measure up to your effort and time lost with family.  Forget about having Fridays and Saturdays off!"
bad,physical workout. Ive learned retailing. Fun to work with others 
bad,"If you have ever learned what customer service is, this place will hate you for providing it. Customer Service is called ""spending too much time with the customer"" to these people.  The management is terrible, the district managers are back-handed, and HR does not even want to be bothered when you complain to them so they developed a department called co-worker relations to thwart you off from complaining about the verbal abuse and blatant harassment that you receive from management. There is a reason this place has a high turnover and it's because you are already threatened with your job from the moment you arrive. The expectations are so unrealistic, it's easy to get fired for not being able to perform all of the tasks they want you to do in a day. Their employment process is also very sexist by hiring sexy women as Sales Managers and men as Customer Account Reps. They ask for ""bilingual"" employees to disguise the fact that they only want Hispanic/Latino employees. This place needs to be shut down and has multiple lawsuits against them in several states. These lawyers need to come together and make a class action suit. I am going to the California Labor Board since I had no help when I made a complaint with the corporate office. "
bad,"When I had first started this job, the pay was great and the job was fun. However, over the course of time, I saw less and less of my family, the job has pretty much consumed my life. Working from 8 1/2 hours to 12+ can be exhausting and the pay does not compensate for the time I've lost with my family. A typical day at work can range between 2-7 deliveries. I learned that you need to have an organized team and leader, otherwise you will fail. I had advanced from being a Customer Account Representative to an Assistant Manager in about 6 months. I have had both good and bad experiences with fellow co-workers, including having to do quite a bit of deliveries of my own. The hardest part of my job is being away from my family, working without any recognition for the work I do, straining myself, my body, and my mind to ridiculous measures, and having to deal with co-workers who do not work nearly as hard as I do, yet receive recognition. The most enjoyable part of my job, is when I clock out to go home."
bad,it had its ups and downs i had to do repo runs and i was sales manager
bad,"The management does not care at for you! They treat you like dirt! hours are bad and pay is even more bad 330 a week to bust your butt 11 hours a day? no way none of the safety rules are followed i listened to my manager after he yelled at me cause i wanted to do a job the RIGHT way they wanted the QUICK way i got hurt, and then fired cause i was in my 90 days and couldn't make it to work! even after I brought in a doctors note"
bad,i was a store manager and was doing great then I hit a bump in the road and all hell came on me. my dm never cares about his team the only thing that he cares about his money in his pocket. when things go bad they will drive a bus over you to keep there job and don't care who they have to fire. watch out if your thinking about joying this company and watch your back
bad,"Overall, the job is miserable, but if you work with good people then you can enjoy the madness..."
bad,"The was the worst company to work for,they treat you like garbage,this is not just a store by store thing it's the whole company.I wish the president of the company would realize how bad the managers treated there employees.The turn around at this company would make your head spin! They are always looking for victims to hire.They treat there customers like they are ghetto.They constantly threaten to pick up your merchandise.The illegal things I seen done to customers was unbelievable.If you don't do what they want you to they tell you ,you will be fired! They train you the proper way and than they tell you NOT to do it that way,they all they care about is $$$· You MUST work at least 50 hours a week so u have NO life at all! READ companies reviews we can't all be wrong!!!"
bad,Get to work early open up the store turn all tv's on get balloons on the show room floor look for more work to do.
bad,If your life's ambitions are to take peoples $ and finance awful generic furniture then this is the job for you.
bad,i learned alot working there mangement is poor would be a great job if everyone was on the same page
bad,"Was in charge of full operations of the store. Sales, Credit, P&L., Hiring, Training,"
bad,"Long hours, and you will burn out fast... I got injured when I was their and was not happy about that. You will be moving around 45-300 pounds up and down stairs every day. Be prepared..."
bad,"No quality of life for employees, company dont care about customers."
bad,this is a bad place to work hours are bad pay is bad mangement is really ba
bad,The turnover rate is terrible. Management team had racial preferences when staffing.
bad,it is by far the worst job ive ever had you have to dealwith bugs and alot of other nasty things
bad,"Oh my gosh, can I just say, don't apply at any of the stores!!!! I got hurt on the job and nobody cared. I had to leave this job because my boss lied about my pay and why he was hiring me in the first place. Let me just say that it stunk going to work daily and having a lazy boss. I got told from the first week ""We don't hire females"". Got barked at for being a Republican!!!! I got bad treatment from day one, because I was the only female in the store. I got asked my religion as well, by the way, that's an illegal question. It's also illegal to ask if someone is married w/ children!!! They broke so many laws it wasn't funny. Then when I couldn't go back to my job, they filed an appeal with unemployment and threatened to take it away. Soon after they withdrew it. They would've been sued for the misconduct they displayed to myself I was told in the interview I would be hired as an Asst Store Mngr, but I got the title, not the pay, just not the proper training or equal treatment from anyone at the office or their non caring H/R dept. That company is going to get a major lawsuit for misconduct with their employees. I chose not to pursue it b/c I just wanted out of there. Workers compensation was a pain too because their claim rep wasn't helpful and was rude as well. She sent me to a Dr that was the rudest Dr ever!!! He was rude to me and my husband from the start and he shoved us around like a dog on a leash when we were in his office. His staff and equipment were outdated and his attitude was unforgiving. DO NOT APPLY AT ANY RAC COMPANIES!!! SAVE YOURSELF FROM THE HASSLE AND TROUBLE."
bad,Rent A Center has to be one of my least favorite places to work the turn over was extremely high and management was very poor.
bad,"working for rent a center has been one of my worst experiences. It makes it extremely difficult to balance life, school and outside activities whle working for them. Rent a centers through out bakersfield do not have a rest area for employees and they will not give you two days off in a row, only days off depending on your posiiton are tuesday, wed or thursday and friday,"
bad,"You will work at least 50hrs a week delivering furniture, appliances, & electronics. Will take up most of your free time you have now."
bad,"Do not work for this company. They care nothing for their employees, seek only to rip people off under the guise of a good deal and thier products are inferior to say the least."
bad,It was an easy job to do but management is very unstable and very confusing the staff and treat people like their not human. I was let go for no reason.
bad,Leadership was the main issue ar Rent A Center. They do not have the correct management to help motivate their staff in my district. Schedule is not a good for people with families. I would never go back to that company.
bad,Do not apply if you have a family or any outside interest outside job constantly threatened about being replaced no help in advancement no percs for doing a good job management is lazy and don't help
bad,"My experience at Rent-a-Center wasnt the greatest, I was lied to by multiple managers at different levels of management. I had to fight for a raise after being there for over a year, and threaten to quit because after they told me I would receive compensation, it took them 6 months to take action. I also had to sell merchandise that was at an 200% mark up to people who couldn't afford it. Then I have to strip that merchandise away after they didnt pay for a week."
bad,"Long hours no time for own family disrespectful and rude customers, store managers get the prizes of team effort. Harrassment  from management  to do sales everyday. Work long hours every saturday."
bad,I was sent on multiple deliveries by myself that required multiple people.  I was injured and was still forced to go on deliveries and repossessions.  Still injured to this day.
bad,Worst place ever to work...... they treat u like dirt and take advantage of you as much as they can and when you say something about it they just brush you off or fire you... they also have a very bad way of dealing with workplace problems like racism harassment and discrimination.. I dont recommend working for them even if it was the only job willing to hire you..
bad,"As long as Aaron Sands is the manager there you do not want to work there. He is by far the worst manager I have ever worked for, he has no people skills what so ever, very rude, inconsiderate. I had several customers complain to me about his behavior and the way he talked to them all females and that they wouldn’t even come into the store or talk to him, he made them that uncomfortable. I’ve watched him repeatedly call and harass customers about payments even when they aren’t a day late on there payment, he also used a “burner” phone to try and reach out to customers, which is very over the line and prohibited when making past due calls. He’s just an all around jerk and just a shady guy. Those are just a few instances of what I witnessed, and no matter how many complaints customers have put in he still works there and it makes no sense. I would never suggest anybody work for him!!!"
bad,So many negative things to write.  Empty promises.  No room for advancement.  Hazardous environment.  Salespersons sell to people they know cannot afford just to get a sale.  Puts more work on credit manager to recover product.  Never a team effort on anything.
bad,"I spent five years of my life working for Rent A Center doing everything they asked of me and then some. I gladly worked 50 to 70 hours per week killing myself to collect money or merchandise that people would finance. In the end I turned in a manager for theft with actual evidence and I lost my job. This was a blessing in disguise though. I am much happier, have a real work life balance, and my work means something. I got to match people with comparable employers in hopes of finding them a career."
bad,"Worst place I've ever worked at, sexual harassment from management, and during the 4-5 months working there, we lost 4 other people trying to fill the management position. I was expected to play all roles in the store,and not get paid for any extra work,told by district to wear more makeup,and flirt with customers to get them to buy/rent things"
bad,"Working at rent a center wasn't thrills. It was a lot of long hours, trips, harrassment to customers. A lot a lot and a lot of harassing phone calls to customers and references. Sometimes you even have to load and unload trucks by yourself and deliver furniture by yourself while the other coworkers sit at the store talking. Once they get rid of some of the workers there and hire better people then that place will thrive better and stronger!"
bad,"At this company you are a number, not a person. You could work there 20 years and they will turn around and stab you in the back so to speak at any given moment. Poor upper management, always in constant threat of your job, zero sick days for store managers, store managers are paid salaries and required to work 50+hrs without overtime pay, penalized for not getting a percentage of customers to pay on a daily basis like you can totally control when a customer pays a recurring bill lol. When help is hired, it's part time help but if you are not within the credit standards (people making their payments) you must stay late and get the number somehow even if you have to go out alone and repossess furniture, stereos, fridges and things like that without help. This place is a joke, they claim to be helping people also but with their new pricing structures in the last few years, they are actually nickle and diming low income customers to death and charging more than double of what the item is actually worth so be ready to try and explain to customers why the items are priced so high and be ready to be reprimanded when you don't get at least 5-7 sales a day.  I could go on and on for ever about this workplace but I'm done. Thank God I left. I actually see my children awake now that I don't work there..."
bad,Poor management poor goals everything is rushed and chaotic nothing is for sure. One day your goals will change and everything about how your job is reworked. Not family oriented was wrote up when my daughter was born for missing a day
bad,"Work 6 days per week and work life balance and job security is nonexistent.  Layoffs are a constant and daily threat to the the company as a whole (more store closures and layoffs are scheduled) resulting in no continuity in management as leadership continues to be laid off and realigned every few months. Some really great coworkers that are unappreciated. Corporate is clueless as to the ""Real"" daily challenges and support needed by the local stores and the staff that are face to face with customers, product ordering, product servicing and new sales marketing needs for profitable growth. The company's mission statement is just words that look good on the web site and not lived every day to truly help the coworkers and their families."
bad,"Bad upper managment, a lot things are swept under the rug, store manager has no idea of whats to be manager, also she is very unprofessional upper management show favouritism."
bad,"Working at rent a center gave me opportunity to meet and get to know wonderful customers and coworkers. However if you are not ""friends"" with your boss, than you could be without a job at any given moment. I dedicated 11 years to this company... the hours are definitely not family friendly but I gave it my best shot. Just to be let go in the end after new management came in and wanted to hire their friends. I really felt sorry for the customers. I heard they were being treated very poorly and the store has since lost well over 200 accounts!"
bad,A typical day at Rent -A-Center would go as followed . I would start my day around 8am which would consist of making any deliveries on the board . around midday I would go into my call lists trying to track down customers who have not made their weekly payment . Or who have been absent for over x amount of time . and end my day around 8pm  after clean of the showroom floor . What I have Learn during my time at Rent-A-Center is to never be a customer .knowing the tricks they use if I want something i'll go buy it . Management at my store was enjoyable to work with . the GM however was rigid cold hearted and ruthless . which expects the Impossible out of each employee And took shear delight of reminding you that your career is in their hands and if you do not perform to their liking you are terminated. The most enjoyable part of the job was when I was let go .
bad,This place treats their employees like indentured servants. They do not respect their employees at all. I had the worst experience working for them and all of my coworkers felt the same. Everyone had their foot out the door waiting for a different opportunity to come along.
bad,This company struggles to remain relevant in today's market and has had many lay-offs. The Board of Directors is in constant flux. There are multiple lawsuits pending against them.
bad,Mejorar en la etica y profecionalismo. Se deben ofrecer seminarios para el desarrollo profecional.
bad,Don't work there or you will lose yourself in the lies and backstabbing that is encouraged by upper management. Upper management uses the employee's against each other just like its a game.
bad,"this company preaches about quality of life that they NEVER PROVIDE ! Often threatening managers to stay at work 2 hrs after close because of collections numbers not being at standard. They’re a joke, they get rid of people who keep the company a float and promote people who have no clue what they’re doing."
bad,Never have I ever worked for such a stressful cut throat business. The work hours provide for no home life. The pay is unfair. They dont have a good training system. They treat you like garbage. And all you do all day is spend 8 plus hours on the phone getting yelled at. And then getting talked down to becuse the company is failing and they dont see the obvious reasons why so It must be because the staff that busts their booty isn't busting their booty hard enough.
bad,"Like working for employers that pick and choose what laws they are going to follow?  Do you like having an employee handbook that isn't worth the paper it's printed on?  Do you like not getting a pay raise for two years?"
bad,it was a nightmare working for this establishment. they didn't care about you well being at all. they would have you pound on doors at 7 in the morning waking up people who didn't pay and wanted you to threatened them by saying you will take their product back or call the police.
bad,"Management was poor, always blamed or written up for the wrong doings of other workers, all policies are in the air, raises are hard to come by, hours are horrible, went above and beyond but was not recognized for it."
bad,"•Determine/Evaluate staffing requirement and interview, hire or train accordingly"
bad,I have worked for them for about 5 years. Bad upper management only care about the dollar not the employee. Highly stressful job and the pressure to sell to someone or get someone to pay all the time. And the job is i don't care what you did yesterday. It's what have you done for me today.
bad,"Terrible place to work, would not recommend.  Store managers are usually nice but regional management is lacking.  Store policies conflict with job duties and you are reprimanded for following company policies."
bad,Recent changes to Rent a center have caused the upper manangement to treat the employees below them like dogs. The company is also in financial trouble because it grown too big to handle properly and is likely to fail. Don't bother working there unless there are no other options.
bad,"A typical day involves, calling collections, telemarketing for sales and answering the phone.  You will also have to load and unload trucks, deliver and pick up merchandise, and do service calls , as needed.  Over the years, I took various seminars in phone collection techniques and selling techniques.  The things I liked best about the job, were the people I worked with and the customers that I got to know over the years"
bad,"Long hours in the middle of the day 10AM-8PM. Low pay. No room for advancement. Poor management. Corporate does not care about employees. Work most holidays. Required to work Saturdays. The job itself was not that bad, but the company is terrible. Decent health benefits though."
bad,I worked there for 4yrs and not once was I appreciated I worked 50 hrs and done everything they asked for and no one notice promotions were 25. Cent raises for all the stress you go threw they need to pay more
bad,"the managers were very rude to customers, the delivery driver smoked and texted while driving, the ast. manager was very mean to employees and did nothing throughout the day except sit on her behind. managers talked about inapropriate stuff with customers and would stand around and talk to their friends for hours. ast manager was constantly on her phone.    co worker cussed me out in front of a customer at a customers house and the district manager was told and he was suppose to me wrote up over it and all that was said was how can i punish someone for cussing when I cus myself?"
bad,"They focus on growing. Customers are free to steel, complain, and pay when they want. If you try to do your job you will get in trouble. And even get fired. Your gm is allowed to male fun of you and call you all sorts of names. Cant keep anyone employed. Over all one of the worst jobs ever. And the fear of taking bed bugs and bugs home is high."
bad,I do not like working here you are always told you are to slow i load and unload trucks assist co workers and customers mgmt is bad imho clean all the
bad,"Company is a joke unrealistic goals, daily calls stating you suck cause you suck, if got sales they would complain and vica versa.  5 out of the 8 stores within the old district I used to work in do not have store managers.  If value your sanity look elsewhere for employment"
bad,"If you enjoy long hours, low pay, and unrealistic expectations by upper management, this job is for you! Not to mention the desire to take advantage of poor people. "
bad,Just stop rent to own in general and start checking Credit again....you targeting the ghetto is like poking a lion with a stick. someones going to get bit.
bad,Work would begin at 7 on the dot were me and my other car's (Customer Account Representative) would make 450+ calls to past due customer/customer references/customer job in an attempt to collect past due rent or to resolve the issue in other means. Then at noon we would load the truck with the deliveries we had for that day and then go to lunch. We would be back by 1 pm then do deliveries making sure to be back to the store before 5 pm. At 5 pm me the the other car's would head out to past due customers houses that we could not contact that day in an attempt to collect the past due rent of resolve the issue.
bad,"I worked at Rent-A-Center"
bad,"The day consists of trying to meet impossible and arbitrary goals set by home office on down the food chain until it hits the store level like a crushing weight. The District manager then call s or demands to know 4-5 times a day why you and the store aren't performing to ""standards"".  Facts and reality are not accepted.  They demand growth, growth, and more growth of the  overpriced, substandard, or damaged products to the same group of low income customers. instead of spending money to use marking companies to bring in new customers.  "
bad,A good place to work if you are a single person. tough to have family time as hours are long.
bad,"By far, the worst job that I've ever had. From unrealistic expectations, to being belittled and bullied by upper management. If you value your family, this is the wrong company to work for."
bad,I truly enjoy my customers they were the true reason I enjoyed going to work.
bad,"There is a reason they have to pay their people the amount of money they do..."
bad,"When i was working at rent a center i reseaved 4 head gashes - all from the super man demands they place on there employees."
bad,A day of terror and slave duty. Manager did nothing but handle personal business. Mandatory long work hours.
bad,"The typical day was organized chaos and silly guesswork passed down. I worked at the Corporate offices and it is the most unprofessional bunch of people I have ever met. If you don't eat 2"" thick steaks and guzzle booze with your bosses after hours, then you won't last. Most of the employees were nice but management loved to belittle, poke and prod any that didn't succumb to the gluttonous after hours life with them. There is a Business professional dress code which amazingly doesn't seem to apply to those that hang after hours. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with a few professionals outside of the department I was in."
bad,"Was Fired over something that happened 2 month prior and Wasnt even warned or written up for it. Also was Fired 2 weeks before Christmas with no warning. If you are a WOMAN you need not apply, they will just get rid of you for having female parts!"
bad,"Typical day at work is rearranging the show room, insuring prices are correct. Managing over due accounts and working with clients to get them current again, Management and co-worker were hard working and enjoyable to work with. Hardest part of the job was being hired without being told the company was looking in to closing the store. Most enjoyable was delivering clients new furniture to their house."
bad,"I worked there for four months and the unprofessionalism, and unorganized environment of this store is not even scraping the surface of this store. The immaturity of the manager and his side kicks(aka co workers) is beyond rediculous. If your a woman, they make you lift everything by yourself while the guy who suppose to work with you sits on his duffy and gets away with breaking every rent a center policy known. The manager does not train you properly but the crew expect you to know everything. The drama levels are beyond toxic. Everyone backstabs everyone..including the ""so called"" manager. Theyres so many problems that i cant even liwt them all.  Rent a center is a great company  to work for . But if you ever get the opportunity to work for this store, turn your back and run far away and dont look back!!"
bad,"First, don't ever expect to see family and friends because you'll be at work till 8 or even 10. Don't make plans for after work because that can change at a moments notice. You will make deliveries of appliances on your own up two flights of stairs and you better be back in 20 minutes or your fired. Speaking of that, you will be constantly told that if your not happy or request time off you can leave and you can be replaced in 10 minutes. Maybe it was my manager but you will be constantly told that you're stupid and the only reason you have a job is because he's been protecting you from the district manager so you better be grateful.. I can go on and on but I think you get the picture. I stayed because I had a family to feed but the minute I had a chance I was out."
bad,"its regular 48work hours 40 regular and always 8hour overtime per week only sure day off is Sundays and always work Saturdays, Mondays and Fridays. do everything from call customers to pick up and deliver merchandise clean everything literally for the same pay as assistant managers with out the lil raise nor so called perks."
bad,It was great working for rent a center . I learned great customer service. I enjoyed all of my co-worker. The hardest part of the job was taking a break an going back to work after. I enjoyed driving the truck and do deliverys
bad,rac is a terrible place to work full of thieves and liars terrible management
bad,"Typical work day ranged from opening the store at eight to nine am, and usually not closing until after eight, then getting out around eight thirty at night. Very long tedious hours. Poor management on every level. Hardest part of the job was the long hours for not real reason, barely ever spending time with your family or friends, and basic lack of respect one had to deal with daily."
bad,"Don't expect to see loved ones or have a weekend off working this job. Saturdays are mandatory, and requesting time off is like asking management for their wallet. 10+ hour days, every day, with little to no positive reinforcement. They always focus on the negative, and any positives get thrown by the wayside. The customers tend to be the scum of the earth, and getting them to pay is almost impossible a lot of the time. So you chase them and harass everyone they know multiple times a day."
bad,"If you have a family, then this is not for you. Your job is always on the line, pending how many sales and or customers have paid on there accounts, you are responsible. Store is an instant panic attack, store manager cannot handle pressure, staff, or personal life. On top of sales and payments, you must also accomplish, in an 9 hour day, showroom is stocked and clean, backroom cleaned and organised, collection calls made, then make sales calls, if time permits, if not, then you do it anyways. Panic mode per manager. Deliver, set up, service pick ups within 24 hours, answer phones, take payments, door to door collections and or repo. Receiving, POP displays,tagging items, travel to different stores for merchandise pick up, and hope whomever covers your collection calls and deliveries etc. while you are gone. Then on Monday mornings, you may enjoy the fruits of your labour, with padded, extremely negative, over rehearsed meetings. Of how lousy we all are for the prior work week, no good, just bad. The good is whisked under the carpet. I cannot say all RAC stores operate in this manner, but this particular one does, and why this manager is allowed to continue, is beyond my greatest educated guess."
bad,This is the worst place I have worked in my life!
bad,"A typical day at Rent-A-Center consists of constant berating in regards to company standards. No matter what you do it is never enough, if you don't hit company standards, work all day and night. If you hit company standards, work all day and night to ensure that you stay at standards. This job had absolutely no home life balance whatsoever. Meetings were scheduled at the last minute pretty far from home with no mileage compensation. The co-workers are all for the most part good people suffering everyday just like you would be if you worked there. The hardest part of this job is both the sales and collections. You are expected to sell large volumes of merchandise at over four times what is is worth trying to find every reason to not let the customer pay attention to the price I.E. ""Compare it to a credit card (with 300% interest) or, ""Delivery and service are included."" The only enjoyable part of this job was the people and unfortunately they never got treated right. Upper management in this company is a joke at best, these people are usually hired from outside the company with no knowledge of how rent to own works or people that have been in the position so long that they don't seem to remember ever working at the store level. Even some Store Managers tend to just disappear at times which is how I got my promotion to begin with. The District Managers are basically a fancy name for a professional degrader."
bad,the job pays well but leaves no life-home balance..if u have a family stay away!!! Not much advancement people in the higher postions dont really train employess so they wont move up with company..need them as pawns. Turn over rate horrible and lots of crooked stores out there beware.. I know from experience got fired for going against a manager who was stealing stuff.
bad,I wouldn't recommend anyone to work here you won't have time for nothing in you personal life and the pay rate is not good district manager is very disrespectful stay away best way I can put it
bad,"Managers are allowed to pick and choose employees they will “hold accountable”"
bad,"I would not work here again if they paid me double. Well, I might. But then I would hate it still and they would end up having HR fire me over nothing again"
bad,Managers are brainwashed by district managers to believe that their is a  opportunity to grow and succeed but you have to be friends with the district managers to move around.The company dont have no growth opportunities and is always keeping the managers in the dark about positions and changes in company company nges
bad,Horrible management with no support. Terrible culture and no value in their people. Homes full of roaches and bedbugs. Constant lies from upper management
bad,"a typical day includes calling customers who refuse to pay and harrassing them until they do, or pay them a house visit. management overloads the work schedule purposefully in order to meet sales quotas so they can receive bonuses which are NOT passed down to associates. if all work is not finished then you are REQUIRED to work overtime (some nights i worked until 11:30pm). there is NO work/life balance, as Rent A Center soon becomes your ONLY life. management will NOT back their employees but instead would sooner reprimand them before ever putting their necks on the line when it comes to what was promised to the customer (most the time by management themselves). employees are overworked and underappreciated; you will be yelled at, called degrading names, and overall treated like an animal. ""if you don't like it, there's the door"" is a commonly used phrase. if you value yourself as a hardworking individual, then do yourself a favor and never apply for Rent A Center because you will never be appreciated."
bad,Excellent pay meet great people as well get lots of experience an many feilds the down work too many hours no time for family extreme stress no motivation and no secureness
bad,"They are racist, they transfer you without even talking to you and its nothing you can do about it. Horrible district managers and horrible co worker support. They don’t help with any claims they only defend the district managers. Will not recommend for anybody to work there. You work from 9:30 to 7:00 everyday all day"
bad,I start my day call past due account then sometime we will have short meaning then we would go and look at see what on the delivery for that day or if a had to go to get merchandise from other store and then after that I would to past due account houses and see if I can collect an account
bad,Very Demanding for the wages. Work 6 days a week. no room foradvancement. Questionable behaviors by store managers. The store had high turnover rate and not at all enjoyable.
bad,assistant managers are expected to do every job at the store. If one thing is done wrong your belittled in front of everyone. Your trained as you go but expected to know everything without being properly trained. Upper management comes and goes as they please.
bad,Really disorganized management equipment not up to par selling tactics are scrupulous and fraudulent on personal accounts there are a lot of mistakes made people many times end up paying for broken products the training is very poor
bad,I wouldnt recommend this job for anyone who wants a social life and respect. The upper management is the absolute worse. They run a militaristic atmosphere with unreasonable goals. 7 out of 10 employees do not hit their goals. I am very successful here but it requires too much work with zero appreciation. Was offered a
bad,I would only advise you to work there if you like roaches and bed bugs ..and nasty people the creatures around your job makes it suck big time and lord forbid you speak about them . They will just tell you man up and district manger is a tool that doesn’t care and store manager just brags about his check and vacation while your out doing all the work ..and co workers are so mindless that they think it’s a good place..other then that it’s a fine place to work
bad,I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone. It was very unorganized never sure what you were doing half the time. There was days didn't get to take a lunch because of poor scheduling of deliveries. It started out to be a fun job then eventually people started acting like they were better than me because I was new. They would run their mouth to me but if I said something to them then I was the one who had a problem with them. They acted like they were the only ones who could have an opinion.
bad,"Your work life balance is terrible because you have the work the hours of the vendors. you are constantly stressed to get sales and at the same time when they become past due then you get stressed out about them being past due and not making there payment."
bad,This job sucked. Credit manager for 2 years and I had 4 store managers in that time frame! Worst place to work ever. Barely seen my wife and kids. My babies hated the job as well.
bad,always changing the way things are done> Management does not really care about you personally. Credit was never good enough yet they wanted you to continue to rent to them
bad,Hired as a sales and accounts rep. Got stuck running deliveries almost 100% of the time. Huge levels of favoritism. Driving to bancroft round trip in a snowstorm once. Instructed by manager to basically stake out a customer's house to demand payment. Got a really good look at the horrible underside of society. Had cops called a few times when trying to recover items from customers. Finally quit when I was told to drop my wife off at hospital in another town to see her grandmother on her death bed and then drive back to work right away.
bad,Would go into work make sure everything was on and playing for customers to try out. Get out list for the day to call people who were late on payments.
bad,"Turnover rate is HIGH for a reason. No work life balance whatsoever and that's how they want it to be. They expect you to live and breathe soly for rent a center. Management is not good at managing anything. Other Co-workers slack off and if your the only one who actually does their job be prepared to have management make you pick up THEIR slack, then get yelled at for falling behind on your own work. They have me doing the job of an assistant manager plus more and yet I'm getting paid the same amount as the slackers."
bad,"management is unprofessional and lacks character. Curses and yells at employees in front of customers. comes to work hung over and sometimes drunk. equipment is unsafe and manager will not authorize repairs on delivery vehicles. Bald tires, non working brakes, no ppe provided for protection."
bad,"Rent A Center was a horrible life experience and place to work. I have a disability and was reminded of short comings, and ridicule on a daily bases in a abusive environment at Rent A Center. I felt so helpless."
bad,"I'm sorry I ever worked here. Most of the co workers were great. Management and above were cut throat and on your back sick or not. You were told your job was on the line daily and home life, that was a pipe dream."
bad,Management within stores and district is unorganized. They want to work employees into the ground literally.  No work life balance at all. There is no real direction or support.
bad,"Not a great place to work, everyone I started with quit, no advancement opportunities, very stressful for other employees and the products sold were garbage."
bad,mass lay offs 3 weeks ago...  no budget for new projects... layoff of key resources that had the ONLY specific system knowledge to provide support.....
bad,"Position(s) are designed to be all encompassing. This means every Rent A Center co-worker must be able to do deliveries. I personally delivered a living-room set with a female, to the fifth floor of an apartment building that didn't contain an elevator. "
bad,"I worked for this business for awhile and it was ok when I started, but after awhile I realized that this was not a place I would not like to make a career with."
bad,"Once hired in your home life is not important to them or spending time with your family. They do not follow through with anything as far as a course of action to make you successful and theres NO COMMUNICATION at all . If you are injured on the job they do not respect doctors orders for restrictions and justify any wrongs they do or may have done . Instead of training they throw you out to do whatever is needed at that time completely going away from why you even took the job in the first place . Its not a fun environment and its alot of micro managing and no professionalism towards employees. Family is not important in ANY WAY and they dont tell u from the beginning that you pretty much have no life other than the job once started . i wouldnt recommend the job to anyone at this point unless you want a job with no goals set for employees to balance home and work . They believe that money is everyone's focus yet theres truly no real incentive for anyone other than a store manager . i like working hard and earning every dime i make ,but for a company that appreciates and applauds true effort and passion for a job rather than the BUDDY SYSTEM that continues to allow those who do not give maximum effort a true chance to grow within the company .  PEOPLE DONT LEAVE JOBS THEY LEAVE MANAGERS so treat EVERYONE with the same respect that you want to be given . SIMPLE yet appears to be very hard and challenging for the ""managers"" in this company . Most of them are rude and do not respect their employees but expect you to be professional in regards to how you treat them . The minute u"
bad,"This company makes up most of the sales data. They are unethical and unsanitary. They had customers under contracts for rentals that the customer had no idea about. They didn't clean repossessed merchandise properly, or at all in some cases. They call customers more than the law allows and before/after hours the law allows."
bad,To be successful in the job you either have to be a jerk in collections or a slime ball salesman selling stuff for 2-4 times it's actual value.mivro management will drive you insane
bad,"They require 48 hours, and will not be accepting of any excuses. They are really rude when it comes to messing up, and they always will find a reason to write you up."
bad,"The hours are 9am-8pm. On Saturdays til 7pm. You have no life, no fun. District managers are pushing sales non stop. If no-one comes in be prepared to cold call hundreds of people. The company is a complete rip off and they have u lieing every which way. Ohh and don't forget about picking up peoples merchandise when they can't pay. Ever see what happens when you take a kids bed away the day before christmas?? You'll see, oh and very high turn over rate."
bad,"The environment was fast past. It was all manual labor, lots of bumps and bruises. Work 12 hours drive 6 days a week, left little for family time. Most of the time we were on the road eating lunch not really able to stop for lunch. Sometimes we were there for all three meals. This job was really hard for people with young family or pets with the long hours."
bad,First place to give me a shot but you truly are over worked and under paid and under appreciated you do everything you are told to do while people sit and do nothing I highly advise anyone who wants to apply here not to. The day does go by relatively fast though that's the only plus to this job
bad,Very stressful being that the manager is very unprofessional speaks to his workers in like trash. Gets away with it because he makes numbers meet by over pricing and lying of the quality of the furniture. Assistant manager is the same way
bad,"My experience within rent a center is jaded, when I accepted the job in Slidell the management has been the business for the better part of 25 years and knew how to run the business and manage employees but when I transferred to the store in Chester the management was inept in every way the store manager was stealing from the company as well as not being able to keep the products in clean and maintained order.  This stores mentality was more about smoke breaks than they were about maintaining any aspect of the business"
bad,"not a good place to work for. they don't care about their employees. you are nothing more than an number to them. they don't respect you and will force you to do things you aren't comfortable doing. awful place to work, and the pay is not nearly enough."
bad,"The company expects you to have no life, at ALL. You have to be available at all times. Even on your day off, they mandate you work. It is extremely stressful, they over work you, little to no training, no respect for using sick time/requesting time off. The worst part is they expect you to sell furniture/appliances/electronics like hot tamales. They will give you unrealistic selling goals."
bad,"This job does half the work to sell customers the product"
bad,"I worked there for over year and in that time I saw so many people come and go. There was always a new manager every 3-4 months and nothing ever stayed the same other than they always pushed number for credit, then they didn't want to collect the merchandise. They pushed for people to pay and when they wouldn't and they threatened to pick up the merch and never would. Then they would get angry that it wasn't picked up. The management is minimal when it comes to information. They never know what is going on. "
bad,This is a very stressful job which leave you with very little personal time. Your hours are spread throughout the day which leaves you any room to do anything before or after work. Would not recommend this job to anyone with a social life or a family. This job really makes you question your morals. They push numbers and credit all day. They want you to keep pushing for sales and payments even though customer may not be able to pay at that moment. You have to call customers all day long even if their payment is due that day. Majority of the work is left on the CARs. Desperately seeking another job. Isn't the job for me but to each its own.
bad,"The company  is very unorganized. Very stressful job especially on Saturdays when all accounts are due. Very rude Co workers. Can't go in overtime or you get written up.they make account managers go do deliveries, pickups."
bad,"The managers at RAC. Don't know how to communicate to their employees and think that talking bad, plotting to get people fired and belittling them gets them to work. When employees stand up for themselves they get fired. Managers will move suspense money from one persons account to a late persons account just to hit goals. At least at Leavenworth RAC. Don't recommend working their at all. Bad environment."
bad,"Very unprofessional people, always make you work harder than you are paid. Surrounded by a lot of unprofessional men who are very lazy. This job expects you to put them first in your life over everything."
bad,Buen compañerismo en tienda el ambiente laboral es bueno hay mucha presión por parte de tus superiores a lograr tus metas trabajas horas extras y no te las pagan creo q los directores generales deverian de ver que es lo que les hace falta a los empleados
bad,"do not work or shop there, they have bed bugs roaches and etc rude employees and employer racist horrible place to work"
bad,I feel bad for people who get the short end o the stick with this company. It like you cant do anything without some repercussion. My review though is seriously biased. Apply and check it out though.
bad,"This is the worst place to work. Bed bugs, nasty used furniture, unethical practices and phone harassment. The management team was horrible. Going to people's  homes to take back furniture that they refused to pay for. Just plain disgusting."
bad,rent a center is the most childish job with unprofessional individuals such as carl crissen a district  manager with was very unprofessional the time I worked their......
bad,"Store level management was O.K.  People I worked with at store level were nice.  Benefits were super expensive and the pay was far less than deserved for this type of physical labor. Expectations for collection and sales we're ridiculous, thus your job was constantly being threatened by ""the suits.""  Bottom line, unless you're a favorite, room for growth is almost nonexistent.  Long hours here and no family life outside of work normally. You work EVERY Saturday and I was told you were off on holidays, yet they had ""Black Friday in July"" on July 4th! Constant change and empty promises is what it all comes down to!!!"
bad,"No work life balance as they state in there mission statement. Co-workers were great to work with, very long hours with spilt work week"
bad,"You work almost five 10hr days, advancement is almost impossible unless you know someone who has a store that can be a good recommendation for you, again I enjoy working with multiple people.  Overall this is a job for people who are 18-25, I was 24 when I started here, taking furniture up 3 flights of stairs is rough."
bad,"The management was poor, the business structure is weak, you are not given the tools to be successful. The management prioritized sales above all else. Constant pressure to perform more after a cut in hours."
bad,I worked for this company for over 3 years. I got pregnant and was told I needed to go on short term disability. I was told to write a letter about why I was going out on STd. Well low and behold they submitted it as a letter of resignation... Which is illegal if it wasn't intended for that. I was an assistant manager so I didn't think being there was going to be a problem since there was 5 other associates not including store manager who could have done deliveries. Not a good place to work at all.
bad,"10-12 hours no-stop high pressured innumerable tasks often interrupted by lengthy horn-blowing conference calls that defy"
bad,"Well I worked there for five months. I started looking for a new job the second week I was there. I worked at the acceptance now division of rent a center located in a national chain furniture store. My manager wrote me up while I was still working in the tranning book for not knowing how to take a payment over the phone. Had she showed me how I would of loved to learn how. But instead of taking 5 minutes to teach me how she took 15 on writing me up. Instead of learning there computer system. I spent the majority of my time cleaning up the disorganized office. Filling boxes of papers and calling customers that already received there furniture references, as well as organizing files. My first day on the phone the assitant manager wrote me up for call avoidance, I guess letting the phone ring ten times was not long enough for her. Are you getting the idea they are write up happy. The phone is ringing off the hook customers want a quote but you have plenty of time to write me up. The district managers are always adding something new to the long list of steps that are already long to began with. Now when you take a payment all of there info has to be fillied in there account. You have to ask the customer why are you paying late, when are you getting your next check,  where do you work , what are your hours, do you still have the same supervisor oh you have a new supervisor what's there name what's there extension so basically 20 questions and write a college thesis on the call. So your a bill collector first thing call past due customers. Call them at work ,home wherever the money"
bad,"Pay is good, work is tough, but I hate them because they ""laid me off"" due to the district being over by 1. 2 weeks later, they hired 2 new people at a lower rate than me."
bad,"Store mgr. has 6 months TOTAL experience in RTO industry and Sales Mgr. has 3 weeks!!  They did nothing but sit around talking to each other and spend half the day on facebook while me and another guy did ALL the work.  They had us do the calls, deliveries, returns, clean bathrooms, clean merchandise, organize showroom & warehouse while they watch.  After all that they had us vacuum, take out trash, and turn off electronics before we could leave...again they did absolutely nothing to contribute to overall store success!  Their laziness and ignorance led directly to us having to stay till 8 or 9pm everynight fixing their mistakes.  Regional Mgr. is oblivious to how unprofessional these 2 girls are and how their actions are leading to unhappy customers as well as an UNSAFE work environment.  DO NOT become their next slave laborer!!!"
bad,the concept helps low income communities which i love about the company.
bad,not worth the pay or hassle. So much stuff to do. You can barely stay focused.
bad,"Any positive review about RAC is a lie, except for the weekly pay which you can never enjoy since you're working 50+ hours a week."
bad,"Worked an average of 65 hours a week."
bad,They dont value or respect employees. Your job is always lorded over your head.
bad,"This company sounds great at first but boy oh boy is it a pile of crud! This is not the place for someone seeking a career, working on or holding a college degree, morals, family, other obligations, low patience, sense of self worth and so on. You are required to work 8-8 but usually end up being there until 9 or later this is 5 set days a week. Monday through Saturday. Off days are either on Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday depending on your position. It will be the same day every week so your schedule is set but to me that wasn't a good thing. The weekly pay was the only thing that kept me from quitting every Wednesday! The staff (management and corporate) is a nightmare. Unrealistic sales goals that if not fulfilled can result in termination. Don't get me going on the bed bugs! They expect you to sell used mattresses from one customer to another! Eww! I would never rent nor do I wish to work here ever again and warn you if you have an offer to tell them to shove it! This job is for un-and under educated people with ego issues! If you have a H.S. diploma and no other options...I fear this may be a bonus as far as pay for you but will never see your family or be able to return to school. They discourage further education. This job is a soul sucker"
bad,"I would make collection call and visits to homes. I would deliver and pick up furniture and electronics. I learned how not to try and collect money and the mean of the word futility. Management was completely unhelpful and unsympathetic to real world issues. The only thing that mattered to them was that you were at work, the rest of your life was unimportant."
bad,"There isn't a typical day your hired for one job only to be responsible for 3 different jobs ( which no one knows who's doing what its based on mood of employees for the day) The management is chosen by the classic phrase (its not what you know its who you know) meaning promotions are given to unqualified people most times just because they're ""BUDDIES"" or are referred by buddies of the hiring manager. The co-workers are basically victims besides the fact that they have poor management most times they're also untrained just "" thrown to the wolves"" most times. The only good thing I can say is if you don't mind having split days off and you're an NFL fan you're guaranteed Sundays off ...."
bad,management is poor. they do not care about employees or customers. worst job Ive ever worked.
bad,I dont recommend working here. The company does not care about their employees or customers and their equipment even within the 90 day same as cash price is highly over priced.
bad,"Constantly calling past due and due today customers. Was told to call due today customers 10 times in a day on more than one occassion, which is illegal. No time for my family with their crazy work schedule. I hated it there for 4 long years. The stress I obtained from my job there was insane. Do not go to work for this company. I promise you will regret it. If RAC could work you 24 hrs a day, they would, and still wouldn't be satisfied. Always wanting more sales, even if no one was wanting to buy their stuff. Always wanting credit down, even if no one was paying or not answering their doors so you can pick up their merchandise. Either way, its always your fault, and they tell you that you aren't doing your job. When sales and credit are good though, you receive zero recognition. Horrible experience for me. Hope you never work for these people."
bad,"this company could care less about you. your homelife will suffer day in and day out. they will ask you to stay till 8 or 9 on saturday if your card close isn't good. they tell you this from there livingroom. the district mgr and up beat you down daily and threaten your job based on your numbers being bad. however they have no idea let alone help you get things back in standard. they have a big good old boys club that protects the choosen ones. would never recommend this job to anyone, unless you like being treated like garbage 7 days a week"
bad,"Long hours, little pay. This company doesn't care about their employees."
bad,Dont expect to enjoy your personal time.  Its simple start early stay late management can be fair but wont take any blame for missed appointments they will tell the customer that your running late when your really in the store cleaning or doing something the manager doesn't want to do.
bad,Poor upper management. Wants employees to obtain debit card info without permission. Will never back up their employees. Will tell you to do something then do the opposite so that they save face. Unorganized. They rather be a boss and not a leader. The discourage actual leadership skills
bad,"Had a fellow employee who was high drop a couch on me and hurt me. Management didnt do anything so I ended up quitting. They didnt care that I got hurt, they didnt even fill out an incident report."
bad,"The management treats you like trash and expects you to do the work of 3 people. There is too much drama within the work place and all the merchandise is overpriced. Plus, all of the locations are located in the slums so the customers aren’t great either."
bad,So it started okay after a while they start to tell you your job is in jeopardy if you don’t collect this amount or you don’t meet sales goal weekly when I was there was 30 a week and you really really have to work for a sell . A 60 inch tv is worth like 3k at the store . No lie if you don’t believe me just go on their website and you will see . Then you have to harass the people who don’t want to pay they make you go to their jobs house mind you some of this neighborhood are dangerous and I’m just there knocking on the door waiting for something to happen . They know is dangerous that’s why they give you a love insurance policy ridiculous. Oh and try to carry a fridge to the six floor with no elevator !!!!
bad,"A typical day would be spent correcting mistakes and righting wrongs made by poor management. this would include failed deliveries, wrong price quotes and many more issues."
bad,"I worked here for about 2 years. I’m pretty sure those 2 years aged me by 20. Long work hours, no work/home balance. You are forced to sell items at 300x markup and still feel good about yourself, while being made to believe you are “bettering the customers lifestyle” all the while making them broke. You are expected to put all of your time and energy into deliveries, sales, and cleaning the merchandise (then to sale said furniture at new prices) when it comes back, all for measly pay. If you have any self respect, dignity, or love for your family. I would not recommend"
bad,"Love my Regional vey helpful and understanding,but my DM was/is very poor manner/ not understanding/ not Professional/ a coach. DM was a slave driver. Only thinking of her success. Never listening to her managers. She’s vey forgetful and not caring for her Store Managers success. She don’t try to know her Managers. No problem solving skills. She talk down to you/her SM. I was a New Store Manager that never got any support!!! My DM always hound me about numbers, but never listen to my concerns. I was a new manager with a new staff and my DM hardly came by to help out. Didn’t help in training me. She just threw me and my staff to the wolves. She was not uplifting, supportive, understanding nor had any interpersonal skills. I was driving an hour and 15 mins one way to work everyday. She had a very bitter and bad attitude!!  Always cussing and very negative. Didn’t have any building skills. Didn’t know how to to teach for success."
bad,"Job is not difficult. You have to clean dirty appliances that you repo from trashy ppl, which will most likely have roaches. Furniture isnt too heavy. Low pay, no appreciation, bad management"
bad,"If you have a complaint or problems and report it to main office it’s suppose to be confidential but they tell the RD the RD informs the DM then the DM informs the SM so everyone knows and suppose to keep it a secret. Over worked, have to work after closing hours."
bad,"This is a great company to work for if you don’t mind long hours. You work from 9am to 830pm all week. The regional management is not easy to work for, he doesn’t have a work-life balance and expects others to be the same. Not a balance of training."
bad,"Upper management expects the world but doesnt give the resources to achieve goals, no work home balance, take a vacation and expect many calls about work. no time off store managers expected to work 6 days a week with no overtime."
bad,Very bad place to work they make you harass people for payments even before they're late they don't want to pay you for the heads work you do they care about your personal life at all
bad,"It is not a bad job, If you have no life, and no intentions of advancement. The management unfortunately is not always willing to help, and are bias specially if you are a hard worker. Their best managers have left. They have 1 good manager left."
bad,"this is a terrible place of work starting from promises to morals. sell people furniture with roaches, bed bugs and other type of items. resell mattress also if a person cant afford the bill instead of helping them we go take their items no matter how long worn torn and damaged they are and try to resell them"
bad,"Corporate culture is horrible. Research this company and you will see turmoil at the top, lawsuits against and a variety of other issues. You can, albeit rarely, luck into a good location as a manager and make good money but at the cost of your personal life and probably morality."
bad,Management is 70 hours a week. Upper management very disconnected. Company needs a massive overhaul to fix there problems. No respect for a Store level employee to them you are just a number. Favoritism is real there.
bad,"The company advertises a Servants Heart but it is all a lie. Due to the change of culture Management from the RD, DM and especially the Store Manager have become very abusive Mentally. Your job/career is constantly threatened daily due to the hostile work environment."
bad,Grest place to work with. Very easy and fun. But feel likeamavement do not care for us as an individual. They do not care if your sick or in the hospital dying all they care for is there profit. Do not feel appreciated.
bad,"Terrible management, terrible systems, terrible employees, overall terrible business, wouldn't work for OR RENT from ever. The manager at my particular location believed he was a Dragon. Overall the company i believe to be extremely unprofessional not only from an employee standpoint but also from 90% of its customer base while i was there."
bad,Working as the credit manager was always a negative environment.  Upper management pushes for an unreal expectation even in the most run down neighborhood stores. No consideration for employee families or life. Constant late night hours being added and overscheduling of deliveries and pickups. No respect for a job well done. Lowball pay to employees who stick with company and give 110%.
bad,Not very family oriented poor customer service poor management lack of room for job advancement lack of team work too physical for one person lack of staff
bad,"long hours, no home life.  you have to make account calls, do deliveries and then if you have the time, you make sales calls or you go out visiting past due customers."
bad,"Rent A Center is ok if you are an hourly employee.  They treat their managers like garbage, and don't have a moral code in the way that they do business.  They will lie straight to your face to get you to do their bidding."
bad,"They always had the employees working long hours. They offered very low pay. There was never teamwork preformed during store hours. The managers didn't know how to control the store, no over time was offered."
bad,My supervisor didn't even write me an accident form when I cut my hand open on a washing machine. This is the worst company I have ever worked for because I was placed on the back burner for too long. I was cut down to a drastic FOURTEEN hours a week.
bad,This is not a good company to work for especially if you have a family and desire to spend time with them. The job almost forces you into harassing customers who's accounts are barley past due
bad,"A typical day at work is very stressful management micro manages every single thing you do and if you dont meet the company standards they will do whatever they can to get rid of you. I learned this a lot about account management. The workplace culture is like a family, the hardest part of the job would be the repo-ing. The most enjoyable is sales because then your managers are happy with you."
bad,There was never any teaching there. Everything in 7 years iv'e learned it was on my own. I was there 7 years and it became very stressful as time went on. Absolutely no work life balance what so ever.
bad,"Very difficult industry overall. Very numbers driven, and difficult to meet the numbers demanded at times. The silent expectation is you work days off, and open to close to hit these numbers as a store manager, and the trickle down effects will result in write ups, bad evaluations effecting your pay to terminations. Small staff, ( 4-7) depending on store size, resulting in running short due to days off, but still being told your fully staffed, and that is not an excuse for not meeting goals. Can be very physical at times, as the ""get it in there whatever it takes "" to meet numbers attitude can create some very precarious situations. The company works on the ""churn and burn"" attitude, where they will just replace employees through natural attrition, to sending them on their way to make it look like they are doing their due diligence. They claim paid holidays off to be with your families, but you have to work a ""holiday schedule"" which means you work one of your normal days off to make up for it. Kind of defeats the purpose. Would not recommend this company to anyone unless they needed a temporary job to fill a gap in employment, or until anything better comes along."
bad,"My time working at rac was very stressful on my life. The managment forces you to work long shifts with no overtime. The car positions is simply over worked responsible for all the grunt work and most of the technical work that is provided in the store. rac wants you to sell their over priced merchandise to poor and impoverished customers. considered the mobster of the furniture business, if u have a choice dont work here."
bad,"Customer service is poor at best, they dont do paper work ever and hide it constantly to avoid audits from going badly . "
bad,"make calls for collection then make or collect deliveries"
bad,"pay is good 6 days a week no work life balance, constant pressure form above to always do better, constant harassment of customers"
bad,"For the store manager a 48 hour work week was required provided that you were fully staffed and that you were hitting all standards.  If not you were expected to be there six days a week (only because the store is closed Sunday) and late at least two days per week.  "
bad,Horrible place to work. The hourly pay is great but you dont have anytime to enjoy it since you work 50 to 55 hrs a week. No weekends off ever.
bad,"not a good place to call a career, decent job for someone that needs a steady income. management needs improvement. Too many hours and too much stress, not a job for many people. Decent benefits and 401k plans are available. Transfers are available"
bad,"Es buena, hay crecimiento, pero es una empresa en la cual se tiene que tener mucha tolerancia al trabajo bajo presion y cumplimiento de objetivos, hay que tener mucho cuidado con las politicas."
bad,"I am a former employee that was employed at RAC for 4 years. Three of which, I was in the Assistant Manager role. There were numerous times that I had witnessed extremely unprofessional management practices by my superiors. Employees were mistreated on a regular basis and I was reprimanded when I tried to make changes to the common practices. This is my advice:"
bad,"If you don't like quotas then this job might not be for you.. constant pressure from management to strong arm customers into payments they arent cut out to make.  Repossessing a dinette from a family while they were eating breakfast was among the heartbreaking things I had to do.  I've witnessed employees getting fired for illegally processing payments using customers' credit cards without permission.  Repossessing furniture in the roughest neighborhoods late at night with not very happy customers. People are convinced to pay up to 3 times the amount of the original cost of a product spread out into ""even"" payments.  I voluntarily quit this job due to fundamental differences I have with this company and how they treat employees and customers."
bad,First of all the company doesn't care about their customers & even less about their employees. They don't care about family. They only care about profits. They have you deliver merchandise in the middle of a snow storm. They have you harass customers & their references. They hold you accountable for 3 different job roles & barely pay you for 1. You have to pay for your uniforms. I can go on forever. Bottom line is the job culture is terrible.
bad,"Most horrible work experience of my life"
bad,"Started working for rent a center in June 2013 thinking it was a good company and I would move up fairly quick after the first week I realized that Rac treats there employees like the employees treat there customers ""buy this buy that give me money make your payment or we are gonna repo your a**. This was the worst job.I found a better job within 2 months getting paid triple what I was making at WAC a center. Roach infested merchandise and eventually the store would get infested with roaches as well. They expect there employees to do a lot with little pay making chump change everyone that worked there was on government aid that was sad. I do recommend this company to anyone ."
bad,"I was just fired two weeks ago for probably this position that they have posted.  I was a collections manager who was not trained properly and honestly thinks this was set up for me to fail anyway.  I worked at RAC for two years and it is an extremely stressfull job that takes your time away from your family.  Its unrealistic to what all they expect you to accomplish in this position.  As a Customer Account Rep they will put a pretty picture in your head about advancement tell you that you will not be a delivery guy but that's exactly what you will be...You will be going into disgusting houses, and dealing with bed bugs and roaches on a regular.  I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone as once you get sucked in you are no longer an employee but RAC is your life. "
bad,I felt forced into transferring to a store an hour away from my house and was constantly getting yelled at by the district manager. If the weather was bad and I couldn't make it he would call me on my cell phone and yell at me then hang up on me. You always get treated really bad by the customers and rent a center doesn't care that they take you from your family. i worked 50 hours a week then a 2 hour round trip commute really made it for a long day. i was forced out by a new store manager that said he didn't like me and i should look for another job because we didn't agree on how we did things. overall i wouldn't wish this job on my worst enemy.
bad,"I have worked personally with more than 2,000 customers throughout my 3 year career, and they've been the most enjoyable part of my day. I have worked extra hours to make them happy and in return, they do the same for me. My most important job is to better the quality of life for my customers and my employees, meaning when my employees needs time off from the demanding job or need to spend time with family, i will always find a way to make that happen."
bad,"This company is so unorganized and treat people ( employees and customers like they are ghetto) If you check jobboards you will see they are always hiring because normal people quit after a few months,The district managers threatens your job constantly,they want you to meet goals ANYWaY you can even if it against company's policies.They want you to get there money no matter what! Some of the things I was told to do to get paid from customers were unbelievable.I have sold furniture before but this is on a whole different level...They know there customers have no place else to go so they OVER charge and than harrass customers til they pay,or worse do a pick up from customers and try going to repo someone's tv,when there kids are sitting there watching it! This company doesn't care how you get there merchandise back they just want there numbers! Don't work here$$$ not worth it.You end up treated worse than the customers!!!! And don't shop here,you will sell your soul to the devil!"
bad,Leadership needs to lead by example.
bad,"The North Platte RAC, might have potential"
bad,"Very unorganized. The manager is scatter brained and blames others for her mess ups. She expects her employees to work 13 hour shifts wothout a break and cusses at them if they try to take a break.  She talks about all her employees behind their backs.  She tells her employees to lie..and she makes it very clear she does that on the regular. "
bad,"You get 2 sick days a year, no flexibility in a schedule that completely overwhelms your life. They play favoritism on who they extend and who they work with. Openly admitting that they will rent to unreliable and untrustworthy customers, and then make you take responsibility for it by keeping you working for 12 hours because your credit is bad... It's like a blackhole."
bad,Not a fun job. Or one you can be happy going to sorry. District Manager fired me after his Manager pulled a gun on me and accused me of stealing. I would never recommend Rac for anyone.
bad,Everything from employees back stabbing each other to favoritism among management and even lying to customers I saw it all. The fact that this company continues to have to close it's locations shows how outdated the business model is
bad,First store I worked at Manager was a heavy gambler and drug user and tried to work us like slaves didn't want to pay us time by with holding our checks
bad,As for this job I can honestly say the environment you work in is not very pleasant management is a joke. Scheduled deliveries are absurd for the time limit they give you.
bad,The hours are horrible the pay does not even pay for a 1 bedroom apt if u like standing on peoples porches for hours in the rain knocking on doors and playing private investigator takin little old ladies refridgerators at christmas kicking old people in nursing homes oit of their power chairs blockin ppl in who are tryng to skip off with the stuff getting shot at disrespected and harassed while u drive down the road then this job is for you.
bad,"Dont work for rent a center, they don't care about your family or yourself..long hrs..raises are not worth it..no way to advance up , too many hours and not enough family time"
bad,left for many reasons didn't like the work place environment employees where unprofessional not enough opperunity for advancement after I was promise and not enough money an hr they were willing to pay to hurt yourself over due to having to lift between 100 to 150 a day
bad,This was the worst job I ever had. The management team was so unprofessional. People where scared to spake up due to  retaliation. Pay was well but I could see why. They pay more because they know what they are setting you up for. The training and development was also lacking.
bad,"To start the work life balance was terrible. Worked from 9 to 7 for five days a week. After awhile it starts to drag. The manager at the store is completely ineffective, lazy and no clue of what their doing. Not to mention extremely condescending. The work itself isn't too bad but you are going out to peoples houses that could be filled with insects. Bringing bed bugs home isn't something you want to do. The company overall was decent, but stay away from the store in fort morgan."
bad,Do not work here. Their training is horrible and so is their management.  They want some one to look like they do the right thing but really they want a person that does whatever it takes even if that means not following the rules.
bad,"Horrible practices, do not care about their employees safety and would rather you collect something than your safety. Horrible work place that's why no one lasts working at this kind of business"
bad,Hard labor for very low starting pay. Management is poor. Areas that you work play a big role in whether or not you will be happy. Not a job that I would recommend.
bad,"This job is NOT going to make you want a career with this company. "
bad,I was excited to join but the work environment is very hostile. Management do not have enough business knowledge. They  dont know what they want. Very confusing team. The system itself was very small and easy to handle. But procedures were not in place. No proper co-ordination between Developers and testers.
bad,Was hired as assistant manager. Just a glorified customer account representative. All I did was call and harass people all day and get sent to bad neighborhoods to repossess stuff from people that should have never been leased to I  the first place. The job culture was ridiculous. If sales goals were not met by end of week you were  it allowed to leave and were forced to sit in a back office and call people to try and make them pay that weeks payment. Would not recommend my worst enemy to work there.
bad,"Like all other dead end jobs it's mismanaged, you have to go in very nasty and sketchy envroments, and the jib is very stessfull. But has it's chill moments."
bad,"sucked hardcore dont work really hated working there, it was disgusting. you really dont know how gross people are until youve been in their filthy house"
bad,Low employee moral was felt throughout the company during my time there. Everyone felt unappreciated from the top to bottom of the chain. Would not recommend.
bad,"Poor management, worst people I ever worked with. Females move up way quicker. Very unfair. favoritism especially for women. Don't matter how good you are, if you're not liked or stand up for yourself. You are black-ball or considered a problem. You're only as good as your last week. No job security. I do not recommend working here."
bad,Sales environment was rough. There was a quota to gain sales in relation to accounts being closed that was at time difficult to attain. Management was not helpful with these tasks since you were accountable for your sales performance.
bad,"Management will offer promotion , then back out on them after you ask about them, poorly paid employees don't care if they do the job right or not management does nothing to correct it.Company should provide uniforms for employee at no charge."
bad,"They dont want you to bang hard on accounts but if you dont you lose your job. bang to hard and lose your job. very stressfull place. all about sales and collections."
bad,Shaddy very shaddy company . Told one thing then another. Only job where I lost pay every year I was there. They tell you holidays off but guess what nope. Horrible company
bad,There is room for advancement only if you dedicate your life and soul to the place. The business model is outdated and anyone can grow to become a leader. Don't expect to have time off or request time off. Long hours and abuse from clientele and some of the management. If you are honest like I was you will have a hard time. It was better up north but once you move to the south things change.
bad,"Enjoyable to work with good customers, but the stress put on you by upper management and the long hours you are forced to work because of things out of your control during holidays, weekends, and the lack of time off to do anything else pretty much kills the deal. Its a very stressful job and it will consume the majority of your time if you are promoted past delivery driver. Collections process is terrible. It is frowned upon to help people by upper management. Constant pressure for store growth while keeping credit standards too low. You cant force people to magically have money. But you will be penalized when they do not. You will have to pick up peoples stoves, refrigerators, beds, etc when they cannot make the proper payment. Sometimes even on Christmas Eve, Thanksgiving, etc. All while under constant duress from upper management. NO THANK YOU"
bad,"prefer not to discuss in detail unless necessary, the experience was a sour one to say the least. Had my father dying in a hospital and management felt i still needed to be present at work."
bad,"I was pregnant and my manager expected me to deliver washers and walk through cat feces.  I was chased through a yard by a customers dogs.  the assistant manger was a nightmare, who would constantly eat his lunch at my desk, leave a mess, mind you he had his own desk, all while I was trying to work. I do not recommend this place for anyone."
bad,The turnover rate of employees for this company is out the roof. The responsibility level on management compared to compensation in pay is very far apart.
bad,"Not a good company to work for with bad work ethics, Takes advantage of people less fortunate than most people and charges interest rates above 20% on household funiture"
bad,"There is no chance of advancement, you have to get unrealistic numbers on a consistent basis or else you will get written up for it.  It is also labour intensive and if you get injured on the job they expect you and even require you to be back the next day or else you will be terminated."
bad,a typical day at work would be a productive business work environment catering to peoples enjoyment and making sure the job gets done in a orderly fashion
bad,This job is for someone that obviously has no life. Theres no personal life for account managers and store managers get all the credit for sitting on there butt all day.
bad,"All rent a center is concerned about is getting paid, they dont care how they treat their employees esp. if their employees are females oh and they lied to me about renting and working there,they also lied to my fiance on black friday just so they could get their sales"
bad,I was miserable at this job. the management was terrible the manager had no compassion for his employees. hardest part of the job was carrying heavy furniture. most enjoyable part was dealing with the customers.
bad,I did not enjoy working for this company.  There is too much lenience with their employees.  Should follow a more structured work schedule.
bad,"Let's go down the list, shall we? "
bad,"With Rent-A-Center you start the day off cleaning the show room and preparing it for the day. Shortly thereafter you review 6 promotional sale items that need to be moved before the end of the week. Next, you will generate an inventory and open up your sales lead tool for telemarketing new and upcoming sales campaigns. After this has been generated, you meet with your manager to discuss reviews of delivery planner for merchandise expected to be delivered for the day (typically discussing what product will be delivered, rescheduled due to constraints/or verification, or cancels due to verification). "
bad,"Long hours and very hard to have a personal life. They expect a lot out of you and once you have any type of time in you get a target on your back, figuratively, and they start looking for ways to get rid of ya."
bad,There was a lot to deal with. The Manager I had was all about pushing accounts and placing us in danger.
bad,"I was a Sales Assistant at Rac Acceptance inside of Value City. It was the worse job I've had in my years of working. Not only are you constantly ripping people off and lying them about not affecting their credit, you also are expected to have no life outside of work. And let's not even begin to discuss the 9.50 pay for a CSR and only a .50 raise once promoted to a manger position. My coworkers were wonderful but RAC Acceptance as a division of Rent A Center suck balls! I quit after working 3 months because I found a better job with better hours and actually help people rather than hurt them."
bad,"This was the worst company to work for,the turn around with employees is soo fast.I had four district managers in a six month period.They train you one way and than pull u aside and tell u just get the money from customers how ever you can.(meaning harrass them till they pay)They have unrealistic goals for employees.I would tell the CEO of this company to rethink they way they do business if I could,I had sold furniture for ten years prior to this job and this job is Not about the customer,they treat the customers like they are all ghetto! They figure most have no where else to go because the customers have credit issue.DON'T WORK Here!!"
bad,"This company preys on bad and no credit people, in which they charge astronomical interest rates(close to 300%), so it shouldn't have surprised me that they only end up with morally empty people who are inline with the RAC business plan. Sub minimum wage pay, long hours, and you associate with the low end of society, on both sides of your desk. If that sounds good, you should fit right in."
bad,NO Respect they make you work sometimes off the clock and over what you need to work on hours. For example they made me work until 1:00 am when I should have gotten out at 8. They threathen you saying you are replaceable that its a career not a job. This job is only good for making money.
bad,"Rent-A-Center could be a great place to work IF they would change their philosophy about employees, hours worked, overtime, and care of their employees."
bad,The management in Hinesville is terrible store manager sleeping with the employees sheesh. The pay was good made at least about 500 hundred ever Dp day
bad,"You'll work too much, they won't care about you at all. The stress is over powering. There is nowhere to go once you've made it to store manager. They will want you to work 60+hrs a week on salary. Any position can work all the way till 8 or 9pm. You only get split days off."
bad,I've worked here for 8 years. they fire no one. It's crazy work hard they willl make u a slave drag your feet they will ignore it as if it's not happening. Dont waste your time
bad,"They used a bait and switch tactic with this job. The job was posted through Rent-A-Center but was actually for their partner company Acceptance Now."
bad,I had to work every Saturday and my days were always very long.  This job is hard to do with a family.  Depending on the area that you are in customers can be extremely difficult.
bad,"No Comment - did not have good experience with this employer.  Day to day routines were stressful.  Company kept having constant Management (RM, DM, manager)."
bad,"Management treats you like a slave, the pay is total nonsense for the work you do. The mental thoughts daily of what you might be bringing home to your family after being in so many dirty homes is enough to drive you crazy. "
bad,"Mandatory overtime, NOT family Oriented as they claim. When I start I was Offered a job that I never Did since all the changes and closing of the store. After the closing of the store I was told to be transferred to a Store which I never made it for 2nd time since they love to tell you one thing and do something totally different."
bad,"Hours were inconsistent, never went by your scheduled time.  Manager doesn't care about you. Over worked and underpaid.  Working with public in their homes."
bad,"The management was terrible. It was not a clean work place. There was a lot of roaches in the office and back room. Due to the poor management, a lot of employees quit, or transferred to another store."
bad,Stay away. Company is going through a buyout and until that is complete it is a poor place to work. Three CIO and $ CEO's in a very short time that I was there
bad,When you let employees do what they want  and you work hard to get things done and no one does their jobs. I had a great attendance but when others were late nothing was done this is just 1 example there were many more.
bad,Everyone was always competing for hours. The days that you are scheduled a long and hard. The management schedules many deliveries back to back with out enough staff to handle them.
bad,"you can be the best employee for 6 months straight after one bad day you suck for your district manager from 100 to 0 that quick, one day they love the next day you are a nobody no appreciation and if you did 15 sales and closed on Saturdays standards for accounts get ready if you do not do it every week"
bad,"You pushed the leasing of appliances that you knew the customer could not afford and proceeded to hound and extort the payments from them as you pushed them to lease more product."
bad,"If I had known that I'd be running a store by myself almost daily,  where there is 5 phone lines, idiots calling constantly with excuses as to why they can't pay their bill, and upper management calling hourly to harass you about how many agreements you have typed up and how much credit you have moved (at the busiest times possible, I.E. When all lines are ringing, people walking in and out of the store, unruly kids running around on furniture, and you are trying to type up an agreement), I would not have applied. This company is the most unorganized, disrespectful, has ridiculously unrealistic expectations, long hours 8am-9pm, you constantly get stuck working off the clock, high stress environment, team-less work and store maintenance, way overpriced, cheaply made products, careless upper-management, rude customers, zero time to do everything you're expected to due in a given day, etc. The list goes on and on. Also you have to use telemarketing to bribe current customers into spending more money, to customers that were constantly passed due making credit high, to people who can't afford it, and to people who have been screwed over by the company and want nothing to do with you, so you get a lot of ""I'm not interested"", or people hear your company name and just hang up on you. The best part is making collection/credit calls of people 1 day passed due, up to 80 days passed due. You also have to harass their friends and family daily until the account is resolved. And then you get to repo a child's bed who doesn't understand why you are taking away their bed. I think you have to"
bad,"I worked with Rent A Center for 4 years and requested a transfer from phx, az area to hilton head, sc area. Well it was approved and the DM out here in SC told me when i get out here to call him and he will place me in a position, so i called him for 14 days strait leaving a message each day along with calling my home office and old DM. Nothing came about it, I worked hard for this company and they for one dont set you up to succeed but they just dont care about the employee only about the bottle line(money)."
bad,Small family business . Small crew but with a lot of responsibility. A lot of inbound calls and outbound . Not very professional manager . Not able to leave or go out for lunch break
bad,"I worked as an assistant manager for a store for about 7 months. In a typical week, you could expect to work from 9 AM to after 8 PM every single day, and you would NEVER get two days off in a row. The average work week would be over 50 hours, which is the only reason the pay was decent.  As an assistant manager, the pay was only $11 an hour, but you would make time and a half for all the overtime you worked. Absolutely no work/life balance. I would request off for a Saturday and would be told no because that was supposed to be the busiest day for the store.  I did not have a single Saturday off in 7 months.  Aside from the hectic schedule and the mediocre pay, the customers were by far the worst part of working for this company.  95% of the clientele of this company has either no credit or bad credit, otherwise, they would be doing business with a retailer that offered credit based on credit worthiness. To say the least, getting an on-time payment from these customers was like pulling teeth...basically begging grown people to pay their bill on time.  And when you were forced to repo something because of nonpayment, they would call you every name in the book.  I had to get the police involved several times just to get the merchandise back. And you get absolutely no back up from the company when a customer did not pay.  The company would basically blame you for the deadbeat customer's nonpayment.  Ridiculous!  Also, there was alot of heavy lifting up and down stairs, and I never received a single tip for a delivery because the customers were all broke, thieving deadbeats.  If"
bad,This company used to be great toi work for. Over the past couple of years they have become all about corporate and not about the employees. There is nothing to great about working there.
bad,"The work day normally would start with calls to past due customers. Then calls from your district manager about how he wants these impossible number of sales from people who don't deserve anything other than, three hots & a cot. But you'll always have that one customer that wants the biggest sofa in the store but live in an manhattan closet. Point to all of this, you won't be appreciated unless you pucker up while on your knees. It's a great learning experience for anyone who wants to test their patience. Bottom-line, you'll be appreciated and respected more, employed as an armpit sniffer then at Rent-A-Center."
bad,"manager did not handle problems with co workers very well"
bad,"Its not a good idea to work for this company if you have kids, or a student. There is only time for work and nothing else"
bad,"This company is great if you do not have friends children or a life!!! I worked for them for almost 5 years, and loved my job and made good money but worked 50-60 hours a week. The upper managment is grossly over paid and are very old school most of them have been with them since the 80's and while I hope to find myself with the same company for over twenty years, I hope I do not become bitter mean and uncareing in the process. Their high driven goals are possible if you will work hard but have a bad week and you are treated awfull. It was always sad to watch other managers go through the verbal abuse from thier district manager."
bad,"50+ hours a week minimum sounds great and your bank account will love it, but say goodbye to family and friends, because this company has no idea what a work/life balance is. It's all about the money. You will be expected to lie to customers, break company policies, protect your manager and take the fall even when he/she is wrong. Oh, and if it's discovered that you are doing any of the aforementioned shady things, it's your behind on the burner, not the people who told you to do those things. Do not expect to speak out about any wrongdoings, because management will just begin scrutinizing your every move in order to find ANY flaw to latch onto as an excuse get rid of you before you cost them their jobs. Your hard work and dedication will only result in becoming stuck in your current position, with higher ups telling you conflicting stories depending on the weather. If you do happen to advance, it will be one part luck and one HUGE part kissing the manager and district manager's posterior as often as possible, and keeping your mouth shut about everything. As terrible as it was to lose a job, I have breathed no bigger sigh of relief than the first Saturday morning I woke up and realized I no longer had to bring stress home with me that night as I wondered if my job was in danger because of not being able to control 200+ people paying their bills. I enjoyed my weekend for the first time in two years. This job will turn you into a hateful, despicable, lying, backstabbing person, no matter how nice you are when you start working here. I speak from experience. If you take a position"
bad,Rent-A-Center seemed easy to work for but it wasn't fun. The job is very repetitive and you begin to feel like you harass customers which I didn't like. Sometimes it felt like your manager didn't know what he was doing when it came to hiring people. The only fun part about the job was not being stuck in the store all day at times.
bad,It is time for a better career change.there is no open door policy.the mgr didnt know his job well enough for the position
bad,"the pay is good, benefits are fair and advancement is as fast as you put in the work. upper management is constantly harassing you about numbers and putting unrealistic pressures on you and threatening your job. Hours are horrible, 9-7:30 and they expect you to be ok with just one 30 min break and forbid you ask for time off its nearly impossible to get but they are quick to assume that you are ok with staying later than you are supposed to. they dont care about you even though they claim so. terrible job pass on this."
bad,The company is ok but what I dislike is how they turn on all good workers to make them look bad so they can't move up in the company. And if the think you make too much they will fire you so that you can come back for less pay.
bad,"For the most part my time at Rent A Center was good. When I worked for them down in South Carolina, it was one of the best jobs/careers I've ever had. However when I moved up north to Kalamazoo, things turned bad. The district manager was very incompetent, and sorely lacked proper management skills. He tried to treat everyone of his stores as if that all were the same and had the same customers. I can tell you that was not the case."
bad,I enjoyed working for this company just didn't like the long hours I had to work and the fact you worked every Saturday The benefits where really good and the getting paid every Friday was great
bad,"Come in and call past due customers. Get yelled at by customers when you try to explain to them they can return their merchandise for no penalty. You’re gonna deliver, build, collect said merchandise if payments aren’t made. Then you’ll show up at their house when payments aren’t made get yelled at even more. If they do agree to return then your upper management will tell you ignore company rules in order to maintain company metric standards. Very contradictory structure with a predatory approach on sales culture towards a customer base of low income; disability families. You will go into the nastiest houses to redeliver new items or return repossessed stuff countless times. "
bad,"Company needs to appreciate more their employees. No breaks! Work thru your lunch if u decide to stay in. Cant call out. If is an emergency, and you miss work they want to write you up.. only store managers do whatever they want. They have no respect for the employees when they talk to you.. very stressful work environment."
bad,You work so many hours you have no time to do anything.  On your day off all you want to do is sleep. Non sympathetic district manager.  Has no empathy.
bad,Ive learned so much that i didnt know before but thats one job i would never want to ever return they have no work life balance they have overpriced merchandise etc
bad,The hours were horrible as a store manager. You have to work from 9am to 9pm or later for 6 days a week. The pay isn't enough to even get a car. Your spouse will have to work as well to make ends meet. The workplace culture was nice though as long as all your numbers are being met. Right after I saw the stock dropping I jumped ship and later discovered the company was bought out.
bad,20 hrs a week max. Bad management pushing way too hard for what you are paid. If it takes 1 min too long for you to punch out they cry a river.
bad,"I was thankful to get the opportunity  to run a store..However, the upper management is awful at best. They do not invest in their managers.  The DM "
bad,You have no life when you work in this company. They only give you 2 sick/personal days in a year. Vacation can only be taken starting on a certain day of the week. Can not take vacations on holidays. No holiday pay. They really don't care about the employees as long as they make money. Not worth the pay for the amount of stress and time you go thru.
bad,Your performace isnt how you are being evaluated they suck dont work for them most miserable job ive ever had
bad,I worked for over a year straight at a location where I was not allowed days off from the District Manager nor was I allowed to hire staffing to fix the understaffing in the store.  Yes I was a salaried manager but I worked 80+ hours each week and got nothing in return.  Calling the Corp Help Line did nothing more than cause retaliation and animosity.  The previous District Manager is causing problems in my life still after almost a month gone from this location.  I am currently pursuing a Defamation of Character/Harassment lawsuit against this company and the District Manager.
bad,Management isn't very friendly always threatening your job for no reason. don't recommend to work for any store in the RGV.
bad,People don’t stay long due to overworked labor you are expected to deliver furniture call routes for collections then call those same people you collected from and sell it back to them later or sell it to someone else for the price as if it was new you have a conference call everyday and talk about the samething for a hour when upper management knows every store is understaffed
bad,I would recommend this job to people how have no kids hours are horrible. At first it was a very good experience but then management was changed . Coworkers are amazing you feel like family
bad,"If you have a family or kids this is not the job for you,  if you want a stees free environment don't bother, if you want daily stress from unrealistic expactaions from a dying company this is the place for you"
bad,"Although I am grateful that Rent A Center provided me the opportunity to work for them, I would never go back.  The pay was good but only because they would force us to work 50+ hours per week.  Our schedules were not reflective of what we'd actually end up working.  We may be scheduled for an 8 hour shift and end up working 12 on any given day.  The store level managers were good, but the divisional supervision was harsh and critical and just plain mean.  It honestly felt like we were slaves to this company.  They cared little about our safety, or our satisfaction."
bad,"My experience with this company is not good. They do not try to balance your work and life. I worked for this company for three and a half years and I put blood, sweat and tears into my job and worked my way up the ladder. My boss made numerous advancements to me and when I turned him down I had to either quit the job I loved or be fired and had my job handed to female that was next in line because she would send him the pictures that he asked for.  I loved my job as far as being able to help people that couldn't afford to go pay cash to have nice things but the part I didn't like is renting merchandise to people that would come get things for their kids for Christmas or birthdays and then they didn't want to pay or couldn't and I would have to pick the merchandise up and take away from the kids."
bad,Typical work day is 12 hours 7 days a week. Hit your numbers or your gone. Upper management asks you to let employees go at the drop of a dime. Company going downhill quick.
bad,"This job was the worse job i have ever had."
bad,Your job runs off numbers and if you miss them your job is threatened.  Company doesn't care about your personal time. Way too many hours worked in the middle of your day.
bad,Terrible place to work. I had a washing machine fall on me while on delivery and wasn't even allowed to go to the doctor.
bad,"The more you work, the more they expect. It just seems that nothing is good enough for this company. You have to go collect money or merchandise if the customer is late."
bad,"Rent a center was a highly stessful environment. Workload is endless. You have no time for family. Your expected to do the same if your staffed up or have no staff at all. Mostly lack of employees is RAC biggest issue, however nobody works there long due to the workload thats expected."
bad,"During my employment through ANOW I had up and downs. I would have to say the worse thing ever is they push sales down your throat . Which I had no problem closing deals . But I think they need to have more a balance .No sales walk mentality . For collections which you also do in side the store. Then they cant understand why your credit ( collections )get out of control. Then push more sales down your throat to balance your credit. She treats everyone like they are replacable no matter how hard you work . Also , in store you will market by using existing customers , cold calls and any other resources at your finger tips . The easy part is your reports doing p and l review and reviewing all your indicators and weekly and daily paper work . Account management ! Another challenge is there are only 2 to 4 people( according to size of store) working in a store which has its positives and its negatives. But as a sales manager you have to call another store for help it can make it incredibly difficult to get help at times ."
bad,work life balance is not good 10 or more hours a day.you as an employee are only as good as your previous days results.district managers and regional directors run things their way not following the companies guidelines.the pay is good as are the benefits.working with customers is enjoyable and delivering and picking up merchandise along with refurbishing and stocking showrooms it is physically easy.the company is a very unstable place to be employeed if you want any job security.
bad,I don’t know what to say it’s just not for me The Money isn’t good at all the work gets annoying and dealing with people that don’t want to pay there bills and you have to stay late just to try and get them to pay it’s just not for me
bad,"I enjoyed meeting and helping customers with any questions or problems. It was a great  place to work when we we're fully staffed, people really liked the fact that I knew a lot about the merchandise."
bad,"No full weekends off. Its required that you work every Saturday. You earn 2 personal days that they never let you use. They make you call and harass customers all day ! The management is off. If you dont hit the store required numbers by the end of the week you are required to stay until 9p on mondays, fridays and Saturdays. Its horrible you will never have time gor your family or yourself."
bad,"it was good for working on schedule and able to balance life and work, training was hands on but it was for a short time, then you just thrown out there and if you had questions you would just call someone"
bad,"In Denison Tx the manager is completely horrible, will cuss at you for nothing get mad at you for nothing, he has no respect at all, worst manager I've ever worked with. The manager is constantly lying to customers and changing things, customers are returning things cause he is trying to get more money out of them than they owe."
bad,They need to put in the job requirements that you have to be a male to be considered for a position. Because the managers don't believe that a female can do the job.
bad,"By far the worst manager that I've ever worked with. Impossible to get in touch with, poor communication regarding the job. Would not recommend applying to the Dover, DE store unless you have absolutely no other options."
bad,A typical day is making calls to customers and making excellent sales.
bad,You were there all the time never left when was scheduled to. it seamed like I was there 9 to 9 everyday . I was  to be a sales manager but was always on the truck delivering and was being told that I wasn't selling enough . I had to chase people for credit and was told to knock on random homes and try to get people to come into the store . I hated it !
bad,"si llegas a ser gerente es porque le caiste bien al distrital, el gerente presiona a los demas empleados para lograr los objetivos, politicas que secontradisen y cambian a cada rato, amenazas laborales, el distrital solo esta de adorno, y el gerente solo esta para regañar y presionar, a los regionales o los de mas arriba no les importa nada mas que sus numeros, el personal no importa ni es escuchado."
bad,This company does not care about their costumer or their associates. They constantly put their employees in danger by forcing them to do illegal actions with the purpose to collect debts. They are also very easy to start accounts so that in the long run they would be quick to collect the merchandise from the costumers with out any consideration towards situations that may come up. They are very unappreciated with the costumers. Another bad fact about RAC is that the employees are obligated to work 47 hours a week overtime is mandatory every week so if you have a family they are not trying to hear it.
bad,never had a problem my hole 3 yrs until a customer hit me and i reported to my manger and the company did nothing about it at all
bad,This is not a good company to work for and it’s a racist company been called everything for the N word to an angry black woman Nothing was done about it either
bad,"Horrible place and very grey when it come to being legal!  "
bad,"Typical day, under staffed the entire time i was there. I enjoyed my store manager and he was the reason i stayed with the company as long as i did. Company cares nothing about its customer, micro managed on the numbers side of the business but DM cared nothing about employees, you as well are nothing but a number. I worked all the time, no work/family ratio. (except for the upper management- District manger and up) they want you to work on your day off at least 4 hours if you dont make quota on there board the day before(which in turn caused alot of managers to fluff as they call it accounts in customers names without customer approval to show a sale being made) Again my boss is the reason i stayed other then that it is a horrible place to work!!!!!"
bad,I could write a book on the experience I had at Rebt a Center as a collections manager or what they call a credit mgr.... please folks do not waste your life and time at RAC like I did.
bad,This job helped me sharpen my interpersonal skills.  I learned to smile more and take a personal interest in the customer.  In the end it was a starter job.
bad,"I was the assistant manager for two years and when you report theft and drug usage to your district manager he just tells the store manager who is friends with the employee stealing so nothing gets done about it, your job gets threatened if you don't stay quiet customers rarely follow processes."
bad,A focus on building programs to achieve goals was the begining of the end for this rent to own giant. Completing task was more important than achieving goals.
bad,"Typical day at work delivers, collections, multiply phone calls, install, handle money, handle draw, stock, banking for the store, customer service, sales."
bad,"Too long hours, numbers based business, company is not ethically correct. Hardest part of my job was to repo peoples's property after missing a payment."
bad,"Overall witching the culture is pre prinotired to prospective employers as a quick paced room for growth family oriented culture.  However. They lack proper training.   Greatly underpay stafff.   The culture within is extremely stressful due to the fact outbid four person full time staff, account rep, sales manager, credit manager., and store manager.  The fact managers all earn salary.  While everyone else is hourly employees delegated to learning solely what store managers choose to train you on.  The culture promoters competition within which stagnates growth in turn their turnover rate is so ugh due to lower pay wages, poor work conditions, and poor management."
bad,"The job itself wasn't bad,the work was easy  (Once you finish training).The pay could've been better for the issues I had to deal with from management."
bad,Management sucked and was very unorganized they would take your lunch break out of your time even if you didn't get to take one because they said you had to have a lunch
bad,"A decent job, decent pay but expect a whole lot from you as soon as you start. Great benefits for when you work at least 6 months."
bad,They like to pretend they are helping their customers out when in reality they are just taking advantage of them. They suck. Not a little. A lot. Really bad. Nothing good to say. Backbreaking work. Rigged promotion system. Long Hours.
bad,"do not apply. period, unless you like roaches and horrible bosses. its a trap. Do not do it unless you are desperate. horrible horrible horrible"
bad,"Drama filled life with this job, working collections, being a mentor, a coach, and a manger with such little pay is life draining."
bad,"read previous review"
bad,Making calls to customers and moving furniture. Collecting on accounts and visiting customers are a must.
bad,Its a bad place to work with poor management. They treat their staff like they are worthless.
bad,Worked for the company for 5 years and was promoted to store manager in that time. Pay is ok. Higher ups probably the worst group of people in today's workforce. Examples would be them calling you 20 times per day interrupting daily duties or sitting in your stores distracting your employees. They want you to sell to everyone that comes in or calls but are highly upset when they don't pay on time. They encourage degrading your employees on a daily basis. Constant unethical/ illegal practices of collections against the general public.
bad,Not good place to work rude to customers and long hours not kind to family needs
bad,"Worked 48 to 60 hours. Not home enough. Not family oriented, sales, customer service, deliveries."
bad,I loved working here it was fun and enjoying i loved seeing my customers every day and i enjoyed the new ones i had contact with everyday they brought a lot of joy and happiness into my life
bad,"Due to company policy and procedure, I was forced to sale over priced (4.5x original cost and some as high as 6.5x) merchindise to customers that everyone knew couldn't afford it. When I tried to question this, I was told by senior management ""It is not your job to tell our customers what they can afford. You will know they can't afford it when they stop making their payments."". My problem with that answer was that by the time they stop paying, the items are already in their homes and if the item/items did not have  at least $1,000 (my cost), all we could do was call them and knock on their door 2x a day."
bad,assissted the customer with accounts i worked a 12 hr shift everyday with an 1 hr lunch stayed on my feet throughout the 12 hr day
bad,"I get to work early in the morning round 7, made collection phone calls until about 12, attempt to sell items in store while at the same time load up the delivery truck. On the road doing deliveries from 1 until 6 (mostly recliner couches on top floor with on elevator) return to store make evening round of collection phone calls, until about 8."
bad,I question my managers about the pay that was posted online for the job I was currently doing that paid 2 dollars more than i was making and was told he she did not like being question
bad,"As a car it’s almost impossible to satisfy anyone. All they see is numbers not the other things you do. Deliveries,going into disgusting houses, harassing customers. You’re hardly ever in the store and they want two sales a week it sounds easy but it’s not . Pay is not worth the strain on your body . Once again another job that the people who do all the hard work get overlooked. Schedule needs to change to Monday through Friday, the weekend you should have off"
bad,Rent-A-Center is the worst company I've ever worked for. The hours suck for 1. Open to close 6 days a week (9-8 Monday thru Friday & 8:30-7 Saturday). I've been delivering and repossessing by myself for over a month. I injured my wrist and thumb while working and it took my manager 3 days to report it in. Was told I had to come back or lose my job. Now I'm on mandatory leave until my wrist fully heals which may never happen. I do not recommend any one to work there.
bad,The manager at the tupelo location  only has a job because we husband a DM.  She micro manage and run the store in the ground . She has a high turn over and she is a their and lier
bad,"This company prides themselves on customer service, cheap prices, deliveries whenever and a whole bunch of unrealistic things that they overall do not do. Management was awful. Every one is always being fired and replaced and you constantly feel as if you are about to lose your job. I worked in sales where they have a minimum requirement of making 12 sales a week. Its impossible. Managers tend to hide items around the store and say they are being rented to meet sales quota. That leads to the whole staff being confused, an awfully messy store, and trouble for everyone except the Manager doing it. The whole company is backwards and awful. Management always makes you feel as if you are not doing your job well."
bad,"Time consuming, no team work, everybody thinks about there self, probability of having an injury is through the roof and the manager will get mad at you if u can’t work for him in that situation... overall takes away your whole life, the money low money is not worth and of the heavy lifting and Managers think that every delivery is 10 min or less... don’t do it.."
bad,Was a fun job until you found out the store manager talked badly about his employees to everyone. Managers also threaten your job and try to bully you on a daily basis
bad,"I’m a current employee with the company and let me tell you, this place sucks. We work from around 9 or 10:30 until at least 7pm. Mostly past 7. You get 1 day off during the week and the other day off Sunday. Saturday is mandatory. And they hardly ever give pay increases. The collection aspect of the job is dangerous depending on the area and way too much is expected from its workers. This job should start you with at least $15 per hour just to deal with the stress and pressure they put on you. If you don’t hit your “numbers” your job is often threatened. No job security and absolutely no work life balance."
bad,"If you have a family and a life outside of work, then do not work here. You become a slave to their grind. Expect you to work beyond your mean, by yourself, and with minimal help from management."
bad,"The pay was not good. You start off your day cleaning up the store and bringing in new furniture, then you start calling people who are late on their bills. When the store is open to the public you try to sell anything to the customers or you are out on deliveries and pickups. Your overall assessment is based on the amount of money you bring in each week from sales and collections."
bad,"Job was ok only thing I didn't like was not enough time to spend with family, Getting out late would effect life and family. I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone."
bad,"My experience at Rent-A-Center was not the best. The office politics and conversations were unprofessional. At the store I worked at in Grand Junction many of my Co-Workers would use company time making personal phone calls. Customer service was an issue, the way we were told to deal with customers was very offensive. My train of thought is treat people you want to be treated, I guess I was the outlier on this."
bad,"Call customers for default payments, harassing customers for on time payments. Management thinks about the store rather then their employees."
bad,"When you need a quick buck to.....let me stop lying. By far one of the worst companies I have ever worked for. Low pay, terrible benefits, no overtime. The list goes on. I wasn't fired. I quit. I was told overtime was optional however, when you get to work its managers who will go in the system and alter your time so you have NO overtime. One week I had 40 regular hours and 16 minutes of overtime and my check was less than $300!!! There is no life to do anything because you have to be there 7 days a week as long as the host store stays open. And on top of the lack of pay, lack of overtime, and lack of respect from management, you get cursed out on a daily basis by customers because they make a deal with the devil that is Acceptance Now. There is too much favoritism within the district and on top of that they encourage you to break the FDCPA Laws! Never work for this company."
bad,"Rent A Center's management is terrible. The disrespect is over the top, they have no kind of advancement, or work/life balance, you go in at 8 A.M. & don't leave till 9 P.M. pay is not good for what you do, I was getting paid 10.00 an hour to load & unload trucks, repo everything, move all everything & set everything up by myself. They really need to get it together."
bad,"Job is horrible. Not for people who have a heart for others, as an account manager i had to make dicisions That. I wasn't too happy about.."
bad,Great if you have no family. I will say I enjoyed managing and developing many co-workers to transform their lives.
bad,"We were hired as temporary to hire with no management available but the salary was good and encouraged us to try to do our best, at the end the help desk position were terminated. Would have loved to work there full time.."
bad,Horrible place to work.. Compensation is not enough.. Company is extremely un-organized.
bad,"hours are crazy in this company, and the pay is no where near enough to compensate the work you put in. good job as a stop gap if you are in between jobs, but there is a reason their turn over is so high. if you actually expect to have a life avoid these guys."
bad,"If you're single and have nothing or no one important in your life this job would be ideal. The good thing is; you keep your money because you're at work so much there's no time to spend it. The employee discounts are not discounts. You can save your $ and go pay less cash for the same thing or better elsewhere. The management does not show any sort of gratitude for the hard work the employees commit to. The morale can be a major force to deal with. If you work here, you must be self confident in your own abilities. The pay varies from state to state. I think they pay better in the south. In Colorado I would never work for this outfit. This is not a bitter review. It's honest."
bad,"They don't have any kind of flexibility, hours are long and some of the jobs to do are a little to much for women to do. Management have favoritism towards friends and are not fair with equal pay."
bad,I mean it depends on the location but some managers just don’t care about anything else but making them selves look good . Schedules will be 8-8 and no OT  over load the CAR position with deliveries and neglect the customer verification process. They cut a lot of corners and screws over the customers.
bad,"Lot of things that the company can improve on to make their lower ranked employees feel valuable. As a Customer Account Representative or CAR, you are expected to deliver furniture and appliances of all shapes and sizes to any house, trailer, or apartment regardless of floor."
bad,"The hours will drain you and it seemed that there was no chance for promotion since they always hired from outside."
bad,It's ok job for people that dont have family. The benefits suck. But the pay is pretty good. And dont think about taking time off cause they give u paid time off after a year but it's a fight to get to take it.
bad,This is not the type of place you would want to work. I feel that your efforts are never really appreciated. One day you may be on top in sales and get all the kudos in the world. The next day be short on a few and the DM will want you fired.
bad,Not good if you have a family. You work a lot of hours and are not compensated accordingly.  Sales goals is not realistic. Customers are rude sometimes to staff when you call them a lot. Too many collection calls almost feels like harassment
bad,"Doesn’t matter what you’ve done or how long you’ve been there, only care about right now. People are disposable. No work life balance. Quality of life is terrible and unimportant."
bad,Running to people houses to collect money or merchandise. Making calls three times a day and then delivering various items from the store to customers houses.
bad,"Felt like I was constantly harassing clients, overworked. I was hired by the manager at 3099 knowing that I was a college student and when the time came, manager made it difficult for me so I had to leave. Staff were lazy always playing video games or fooling around."
bad,"My day to day consisted of very long hours persuade customers to pay their bill, buy overly expensive at nearly 4x the cost of retail and driving for hours a day."
bad,"Simply put this company treats its employees like replaceable pieces, offering them poor hours and expecting miraculous sales. The wages are low for the back breaking work they expect you to do. Their stock is often infested with bugs such as roaches and bed bugs. The company informs you that if you get bed bugs at home after having contact with these at work they are not responsible for the clean up. There is no proper training or instruction. I warn anyone thinking of taking this job that if you have to take it do not stay use it until you can get a better job. There is no future for the common worker of Rent-A-Center."
bad,"Recruitment is done in Texas, The pay is so low, no one applies. Cannot ask for days off, and are reprimanded for calling sick. You only get Sunday off because you're understaffed all the time."
bad,"Poor work/life balance  Very cut throat business. It was fun but it can be stressful at times. You have to work hard for what you want and that means to sacrifice a lot of your time and a lot of the time they won't recognize your hard work and if they do, you just get a pat on the back."
bad,its a job. it pays the bills. if you are not a sales person this is not the place for you. the home and work balance sucks. the weekly pay helps a little.
bad,"This compa is no good environment  for growth like professional.. The managers, DM doesn't get involve 100% with nothing and just make our job more complicated. Bad communication, bad training."
bad,"I could work any where from 8 to 16 hrs a day, and being a larger stronger person I was taken advantage of made to make all deliveries alone including living room sets to top floor apartments and full bed room sets. Not the greatest place to work"
bad,"not a good place to work if you have a family. Super long hours, massive amount of pressure. District manager would just goof around and would never teach you anything. Regional manager was a dictator that managed by instilling fear in the employees."
bad,"Super High Turnover! Upper Management expectations are ridiculous! Recruiters will lie and lie hard to get people into the job, then when it happens will not answer their phone! Theres no training but will send you to a training store that's so busy they wont have time! I CANT KEEP EMPLOYEES! The company places tyrants over the districts who push and pull every last drop out of their employees! Your always alone in the store and have to work on your lunch break just to hit the ridiculous number set by a newly promoted regional(every year there is a new one) who only wants to hit these numbers and doesn't care if he destroys your life to get them!  Everyday is a high volume sales day laced with expectations of higher sales than the day before! THERE IS NOT ONE ONCE OF APPRECIATION FOR GOOD WORK!"
bad,"There is no work/life balance for a Rent-A-Center employee. The job descriptions are very misleading, the descriptions all have manager attached to them, but they aren't management positions in a traditional sense. As an assistant mgr. You are required to stock, refurbish, price, display, signage, make telemarketing sales calls, make sales goals quotas in showroom, make deliveries as needed, manage collection managers, complete deposit and take to the bank and many more duties all for the wonderful starting pay of 10.25 an hour. So yes,  if you want to work long hours, every Saturday, and be responsible for everything from managing coworkers to pest eradication...RAC IS A FABULOUS JOB."
bad,you work 48 hours a week mandatory. no family time.  days are usually 830-7 everyday. you are expected to do deliveries in all kinds of weather even the winter when the roads shouldnt be driven on.
bad,"As a former employee at this exact location I dont recommend this location. Rent a center company itself is good. The people working there are awesome people helping each other out to get the job done. The benefits and discounts are great. There was only one down side which brings many other things along with it. Favoritism. Starting with the district manager towards a non-professional manager, who is disrespectful not only to her customers but her employees, because shes on a power trip Will blame you for things that she does and is a total hypocrite Definitely not manager material! Once you report someone management to the higher up... Youre now a threat to the company. They will do anything in their power to remove you. You have to work on a CYB basis (cover your Butt) every Man for himself! Its bad You can even ask their customers...Bad environment to work at and be at period!"
bad,"This job was confuasing in what they would tell you and train you about, and then change the story the next day. There was alot of pressure to perform and to catch up to people. The communication was terrible"
bad,"Like a payday loan store, they charged outrages prices on merchandise to lower income people."
bad,rude bosses always working hardly ever had a day off always calling and aggravating customers because of bosses
bad,Horrible business to work for. much pressure to be a repo man and prey on people
bad,"As you start with RAC it looks like a promising place to grow, however as the days, months and years go by, you start to notice that, you must be wiling to be on your knees at all times to get noticed even a bit. All your great attributes are overlooked unless you are getting the sales to make the regional more money than they are getting. You must forget about your life and family with this job, just like management forgets that you have a life and a family. You will work 12+ hours almost daily, which is good, overtime=more money however, ,come Friday, all that goes out the door as management will either cut your day short by making you come in late or leaving early, this way overtime is not paid, as your overtime counts after 40 hours not 8. Very frustrating as you think by the end of work day Thursday you have 40+ hours, then Friday is just pure overtime. Nope! if its against having a better life for the employee and his family, why not right?"
bad,"Poor management, long work hours, unrealistic goals.  Late nights, long weekends at work.  "
bad,"Daily inventories of merchandise, development targets for sales, strategize collections and deleveries of new accounts. The company strives on rental agreements with the pitch of no credit checks but morally the service offered was not without a cost. Employees are trained to target for sales with the expectation of collecting merchandise to only redistribute to another customer."
bad,Rent-A-Center was a hard job for me because I was forced to repo.
bad,worked for them for 5 years and you have no family time at all. it is all about the company and nothing about the employees
bad,"will rarely pay overtime worked. takes a lot of personal time/life. if you're single with no kids, this job might be for you.benefits don't start til after 6 months."
bad,"This company caters to the lowest of the low. Criminals, ex convicts and predators."
bad,"Management did not help with any problems that arose. In fact, they were unprofessional themselves. Bad communication within staff. Made things unclear sometimes."
bad,Very busy and fast paced...I could not go out and physically do the work any longer. Going to people's homes to return merchandise and driving constant.
bad,"Worked there for 2 years, worked hard and got a promotion, pay barely changed. They will suck the will to live from you and barely compensate you for any of it."
bad,"The company offers no bonuses, only two sick days a year, and the job is too strenuous with not enough pay. Caught management doing drugs in the bathroom and wasn't fired. Big 8 months wasted."
bad,This job will have you at work all day. No time for family at all. Most of the locations work hrs are from 10am - 8pm and you have to work every weekend. They don't train there employees well. You also work most holidays.  Just don't want here if you want days off with your family or proper training.
bad,"6-8 big delivery a day "
bad,By far one of the worst jobs I've ever had in my 46 years on earth. This is a job for high school or college students. The forbidden weekends of rule is over rated. The harassment of late paying customers is stressful. Not worth the money paid hourly.
bad,"Worked as an employee for a full year. Worked at the Fenton store. The management didn't ever follow the company's policy's to the point they openly mocked district managers. Main reason of resignation was due to the fact they do their best not to train you on the SIMs system, keep you out on the road doing delivery's, neither to teach sales or other basic duties. They also will not teach you sales lead tool. You're just a repossession and delivery guy. Not worth the pay to do 3 jobs and work inside infested houses because they will still make you deliver there even if it's a Hazzard."
bad,"Average company at best when I was there to say the least. Opinions are not a valued asset, and most times met with opposition from the start. No team meetings and even less individual meetings. There is no continuing education, or classes to assist one in growing in their career, absolutely no interest in assisting someone in preparing for promotions. It really seemed that the higher up in management one was, the less courteous they had to be to those below them, as well as they do not have to set a positive example. HR does not take concerns seriously in my view, and does not follow up as they stat they will once the process is done. The environment is not friendly for the most part, as communication is lacking all the way around. The hardest part of the job was just getting to work, it was not an exciting or inspiring time at all. The most enjoyable were the few people that spoke in passing or at least acknowledged you at times."
bad,"Management on a store level is decent, it's when you hit district and above that it gets extremely bad. Horrible work/home balance, expensive insurance, sub par pay for the work. An all around bad experience."
bad,"I was hired as sales manager and turned into taking on every responsibility in the store. Long days, poor pay and expensive insurance. DM micro manages. Co workers have been the only plus side to my tenure with this company."
bad,"this was a horrible place to work. you have to lie to people to get them to buy a tv thats worth 199 for 1k. management was corrupt and im thinking about suing the company for my own personal reasons.  weekly money was worth it, only if you like not having time to spend it."
bad,The orientation to the job was good. Most days started a 10 am until 7:30 pm. We had to work ever Saturday and I had 1 week day off for working on Saturdays. I enjoyed driving the delivery truck and the other staff working at the store were great. The manager was not so good. He was one of these guys that enjoyed putting everyone down and for kicks he liked to pass gas in front of people and usually blamed it on someone else. Needless to say he lacked class and common social interaction skills. It was a full-time job with benefits and that was what I needed at the time.
bad,"They need work on actually following their mission statement & they don't respect the adage ""Take care of your employees and  they will take care of you""."
bad,"Pushing product in people who really couldn’t afford it in the first place is not in my beliefs    "
bad,Jus don't do it.  If you like fishing.  Golf.  Your kids.  Do not work for this company.  HR is a joke.  They allow violent behavior towards new employees.  While at the same time.  Telling the victim he/she must coexist with the aggressor or resign.  Just do not work for this company.  Extremely long hours.  Toxic aggressive co-workers.  Moving furniture while others look on when it's not even part of your job description.  In short.  Mentally and physically exhausting.  #2017???  RUN!!!!!
bad,"There is absolutely no work life balance. Store manager? Forget days off period. Forced to work 60+ hours a week for not so great pay for what you are expected to do. Now that things are up in the air with the company demands, expectations, and treatment from upper management has gotten out of control. If you want a life with your family or you want to remain in good health do not work here. The stress and hours take a toll on your body."
bad,"it was a some what a good work place but the dm was not very understanding and his english was really not all that good i will have to say that my new dm was not that bed but working for rent a center you will be over worked as a manager and under paid, they want you to open and close the store every day even on your day off the DM will tell you to come in to work."
bad,"Typical work day is 8 am start and make past due calls and then set the truck up for returns and or deliveries for that day."
bad,"Rent to own business is kind of a cut throat business within itself, and this job was just way too stressful and really not worth the minimal pay that they gave you."
bad,"This company offers no type of work life balance. You HAVE to work whatever HOURS they want you to, regardless of what time the store opens and closes. They want you to put work before your children, when you ask for a Saturday off they think its the end of the world."
bad,It could be better if the manager wasn't so strick about hours and how he is with customers. He is always eating and gone. Stays doing credit I. His truck
bad,This is a very unstable place to work.  Sales numbers are low and management does not help you to succeed.  I would not want to work there again because you never know when your job will be eliminated.
bad,Slave work. No raises. Management will make promises that they do not follow through on. Manager and Assistant manager sit on their phones and play games instead of working.
bad,"The job had some great rewards when dealing with and helping customers. Company processes, direction and support were all inconsistent. No actual allowance of a significant work-life balance."
bad,"I worked 6 days a week from opening the store to closing the store. The Store Manager was a nice guy but very lazy. Too much heavy lifting and delivering for the pay. Totally not worth it, period!"
bad,The management of this company expect you to not have a life and be all about rent a center not having any concern for your well being they expect you to just work astronomical hours and not care if anything happens in your life
bad,"horrible place to work"
bad,Over all company cares for it's customers and products.  Could improve on team work. You get to work alone alot and sometimes you're put in dangerous situations and management won't really back you up if something goes wrong they give a warning next time if it happens again you won't work for awhile extra time off.
bad,"Management sucks! they pick & choose who they like!!! Pay is good, but at the same time, why would you want to go somewhere they dont treat you with respect."
bad,"VERY non professional about anything that you have going on with your life, They don't care realistically about anything that is not work related."
bad,"At Rent A Center, they provide little to no training on how you are truly expected to do your job. They sit you in front of a computer and have you watch videos which does nothing for you. "
bad,"As a Manager-In- Training, I was required to preform every aspect of the operation, Sales, Promotions, Delivery, and Back Office. The training was good, and the people I worked with were nice. The hours were long and I always had split days off. There is a set order of operation that must be followed. If you are use to being a free thinker and a problem solver, this is not the job for you; the daily tasks are set in stone. I was promised my own store, that never happen. Had issues with the store manager being rude, had to take it up to HR. In the end I resigned. Would I recommend this company, yah...it just not for me."
bad,"This company is absolutely not what I thought it would be, their benefits for employees are no where close to being  good, the management is demeaning and degrading to staff. They pride themselves on putting down there employees if their collections isnt  where they want it to be, everyday that you leave this company after a day of work, you will think twice about returning. During the interview process they do not give you all the details of what your day to day will consist of. The salary is barely livable and the fact that you dont have set days off is ridiculous. You have absolutely no life working at this place. They sell you a dream of oppurtunity to grow however, seems like your hard work doesnt pay off. As an employeer you are subject to bad attitudes of the management along with violent customers who may be unhappy for one reason or another. Honestly just an all around bad experience. However amongst the continuing bad the fact that working in a very high paced envirionment gave me the oppurtunity to learn to juggle many task and account management."
bad,"Corporate all the way down to the regional manager do not care about the employees, especially if your performance is not tip, top monthly. I took over a store that was under chaos. Received a brand new staff of 3 employees, two of which were brand new to the company. The other had 5-6 months experience and had received training, but was not ready to be an assistant, basically making it so I had to do everything. I turned around the store which was down on the year almost singlehandedly in the matter of a few months and was one of only 3 stores out of 10 to be up on the year. The issue was my staff just never improved, no matter what I did. They became so dependent on myself to do everything, otherwise my job would be on the line. Needless to say, I left because we became a staff of 3 total and I was done babysitting, working long hours, and being underpaid, especially bonus wise while my peers were in larger stores, under performing, yet earning more and never seemed to be under fire because of long tenures."
bad,"Rent A Center culture has continued to employ and back unproductive, anti-customer Management. Learned a plethora of info about the Rent to Own industry."
bad,hostile work environment. forced to work overtime with no notice. forced to be abusive to customers or will be written up
bad,"I would not recommend working at Rent A Center. There is completely zero room for a family life, it takes a toll on you after awhile. "
bad,"When I went to work for the myrtle beach district, I experienced bad management skills."
bad,"Schedule is awful and gives you no time if you have a family. Management never backs you up. Management also continuously"
bad,"Open/close store and drawers, set up POS and computer systems, receive inventory and enter into system, set showroom, make sales and delinquency calls and reports, deliver 24 hour court notice for stolen items, carry out repossessions, meet weekly and monthly sales quotas, type/sign rental agreements, audit inventory, bank deposits, conduct interviews, write and carry out disciplinary actions, maintain store in running order while manager is off, speak to irate customers, update information, and carry out daily sales log and daily checklist."
bad,This place will work you to death.  Not family oriented at all and you will work every Saturday. I could not even get off a Saturday for my son's birthday party. Worked there over a year and Never had a Saturday off.
bad,Work very long hours for very little in return...benefits package is awesome
bad,Hours are long from 8am to 9pm Mon-Sat. Fun co-workers and a busy day makes the time go by fast. Hardest part of the job is delivering furniture in the middle of winter. Management postions tend to be filled with older people who do not know much about social media and new age technology. They have a high turnover rate.
bad,"The manager had a certain amoumt they could spend a momth on the store on items that were needed amd anythimg left over wemt to the manager(who told me was the manager himself). So here is my story my coworkers picked up sofa set that was infested with FLEAS!...i started getting bit and told my manager and coworkers, i dont have pets so i didnt brimg it to the store,afraid to take it home because of my daughters. they did not believe me until they started getting bit which by that time it was 3 weeks(my legs still show the scars). My manager refused to call pest comtrol and buy the medicine(because it was coming from his paycheck). my 2 coworkers did not have hygiene and they did not bathe or groom and one had really smelly feet.. till this day im scarred of the smells"
bad,job security is never safe people stand around doing nothing waiting for you to do it
bad,I am grateful for the opportunity to work for this company and appreciate being able to provide for myself and my family.
bad,Do not get the training and they are quick to fire you for mistake due to non training. Mgmt is not easy to deal with and they treat customer awful.
bad,Is not a hard job per say but they're expectations are ridiculous with the tools and info you're given. They should lower the prices for costumers and have a better background check system.
bad,"Working at RAC was a total nightmare, scheduling was always wrong, deliveries always out of wack,  customers weren't happy and management hardly ever had an answer.  Worst place to work ever.  I find recommend to anyone,  unless you're desperate."
bad,"Is it your dream to move heavy furniture into houses and then go repossess the same furniture a month later? What about calling people nonstop either for them to pay their bill or to try and sell them something? Is it your dream to drive a box truck with absolutely no training and be berated by your managers when you do poorly?  "
bad,"I was an assistant manager there. The customers were amazing but the manager and other managers I had to work with, were unfair and very biased. They treated every employee different and didnt really care about me being pregnant or the safety of my unborn child at the time"
bad,As a manager you are required to work 5-6 days per week. No like/work balance. Vacations are often cancelled last minute. Not much support coming from district Manager. Most want to run district through extreme texting through out entire day. Definitely wouldn’t recommend to anyone with children or social life to be a part of this company.
bad,"Collections and sales.... terrible mix! Managers ,I have had 7 in 5 years, the hours suck. pay sucks but depending where u are plays a big role in how much they pay u.. customers are 50/50...it's definitely not a job for anybody!"
bad,"So many up and downs. "
bad,Lack Of Managers Need To Talk With Customers Better Drivers Need More Hours To Have A Full Shift With Lunch Breaks Need More  security cameras  so employees and managers and customers all on cameras and everything can be recorded for everybody safety
bad,"Bad company to work for. Arbitrary numbers they expect you to hit, no exception made when we were shorthanded and i jad to do 2 peoples jobs. Asked to move furniture that had bed bugs despite company policy stating otherwise. After working a store shorthanded at 75% and often 50% of typical staffing (and successfully hitting their silly numbers) got a .07¢ raise (lol). Ridiculous schedule means nothing, regularly expected to stay past scheduled time off and denied normally scheduled days off because they cant keep store staffed."
bad,"Started as a part time delivery driver but was promoted to customer account rep. Was a good learning experience being young. I was asked to work on my regular off day last minute. I had a scheduled appointment I couldn't miss. My manager wanted to begin his vacation on that day, I was told if I didn't come in on that day he would have to take action. when I came in the day after my off day, I worked all day and before I was about to clock out for the day I was called into his office and terminated."
bad,"My time here at RAC has been very negative. The only thing that has kept me from leaving is my team. We all are close and put each other before ourselves. There is no time for training even though the company stresses it. 90% of customers are lying, thieving, aggressive people, and it puts great stress on the account managers. The legal action is never taken and instead the account managers are pushed to continue knocking on past due customers despite it being dangerous/useless. The technology is outdated as well as the vehicles. The company's higher management is always re-renting to customers who have skipped town and returned making it the team's job very hard to keep their numbers in the positive. There is no time for family and getting a day off is near impossible. Vacation time is hard to come by, a year there and only 16 hours have accumulated. If you work here you need a high tolerance for stupidity and long hours. I did work alone for half the time so maybe someone with a partner will have a more successful experience. At least you get overtime."
bad,"The area that I was in had too much of a focus on profit, vs doing what was right for the customer. Would re rent merchandise that I was not comfortable with putting in someone else's house."
bad,"Working for rent a center is very stressful and with very long hours daily. Weekly if goals were not met, higher management always made threats of your job security. All it was important for rent a center management was the numbers they wanted to be met. It did not matter if employees worked very hard to reach goals and worked extremely long hours, if goals were not met employees were quick to replace."
bad,Clock in and make calls to insure delivery of goods. Make collection calls to late customer for payments. The hardest part of the job was delivery of heavy furniture or appliances.
bad,All in all it’s a great company to work for but my two years here have been so many ups and downs. The training of staff needs to be done over at least every two years .an the management team needs to work a long side the team. The higher up need to investigate into why each store is not growing in  profit . They should have an employee that  floats from store to store an see why each team is not meaning  standards
bad,Fired for telling my manager he wasn't following proper procedures. It's no wonder they have such a high turn over. Only positive would be the schedule since the stores are only opened until 7pm and are closed on Sunday so you can actually have somewhat of a normal life outside of work.
bad,"I work for 6years.everything you do supposed to be two persons; delivery, pick ups, showroom and warehouse.I make all things alone and you know what happens? I have 3 surgery on my lower Back.But you know what? Thanks Rent  A Center."
bad,"Was very fun up until I got a shady 2 faced DM that is only worried about his career and dont care about his employees. My store got sold and me and my team were only told 12 hours before we had no job. I would think twice before referring anyone to work for this company, me and my team did everything right and grew the business made it profitable were number 1 and got let go so sad to say it was a waste of time working and trying so hard for district 403 my DM sucks."
bad,"theres a lot to say, but it all ended due to the terrible way their managers are aloud to treat their employees, screaming and cursing at employees and customers, threatening them, texting them rude things and talking down to the people under them, this was all brought to the district managers attention, and nothing was done till someone outside the company saw what was going on and reported it to corporate, awful place of employment."
bad,"Manage your customer's account. Learn communication skills, and sales. Relaxed work environment. Get the opportunity to leave the office for deliveries and pick-up orders."
bad,"Cold calls, bed bugs, ripping stuff out of peoples houses, over charging people. What's not to love. In all the job was OK when you have a good manager who wants to do things the right way. However, a bad manager will make this job less moral than a politicians."
bad,"Same as above, low pay, long hours and very little assistance loading and unloading.  Many times worked during lunch and never received overtime and/or benefits."
bad,high pace fast moving very stressful very dangerous I would not recommend was asked to do illegal things no more to say not a great place to work not for me
bad,Team work and communication within all departments needs improvement. There's not a lot of room for growth and company needs to implement better training.
bad,"A lot of work and people not productive. Constantly on cell phones, watching movies, sports ect.. not doing productive work. Very uncooperative when teaching and informing new processes . I did learn how not to work."
bad,I worked at rent a center for 7 years and felt this was a thankless job and they always want more and make you feel threatened if you don't do as they want.
bad,Terrible management. Will never get a raise because it effects store managers bonus. Managers sit at their desk all day on their phones.  You have two off days and they are never consecutive. The turnover rate is unprofessional. I have worked under four store managers in three years and over ten different employees at my level at two different locations. Lack of concern for customer needs. Overall extremely unprofessional and unsafe. Broken equipment that never gets fixed.
bad,"Jobs are threatened consistently, no work/life balance, dangerous situations, they don't care about employees or customers. Most miserable 4 years of my life"
bad,"I learned many skills from my 2.5 years working at Rent a Center but felt like coworkers are completely under-appreciated, and under-compensated for the amount of work put in. A typical day at work would be working anywhere from 8am-9pm depending on how the store was performing, coworkers are expected to call credit (past-due accounts), perform collection activities such as filing court paperwork and doing field visits, along with sales activities (telemarketing) and in-store sales, as well as taking payments and general customer service. Management was pretty much non-existent or completely overbearing, nothing in-between. There is no such thing as work-life balance or respect at Rent a Center."
bad,Super stressful. No life work balance at all. Pay is great for area but comes with tons of pressure. Management is very cut throats and closed minded.
bad,A very stressful work environment.The hardest part of the job was having to pickup the items being rented from families unable to make their payment and children would cry.
bad,I will not go into full detail about this company. It took for me to no longer work there to realize that i was losing myself and not enjoying the quality of life
bad,"Completed a daily pre-trip inspection checklist before first delivery of the day. Selected the most efficient routes in compliance with delivery instructions and fuel policy. Presented customers with bills and receipts and collected payments for goods delivered. Established long-term customer relationships through prompt and courteous service. Resolved customer complaints and adjusted orders. Operated motor vehicles in a safe and efficient manner. Processed payments by accepting cash, checks and credit card payments. Obtained signatures needed to complete and process all paperwork in a timely manner. Operated manual and mechanical equipment in a safe and efficient manner. Loaded and unloaded merchandise at stores and vendor locations."
bad,My delivery buddy was about the only thing that kept my sanity. Boss doesnt care for your safety unless it could him in trouble. Some customers were great.
bad,"At first it was a great place to work, however they just keep laying off employees. Every 3 to four months there is a lay off, there is no stability, they seem to hire and promote employees that do not have experience or people skills, managers continually making bad decisions that  cause employees to get laid off or resign."
bad,"Rent A Center tends to target poor people who are not responsible with money with the intention to charge between 3 to 6 times the retail price for either furniture, electronics or appliances. If the customers go anywhere from 2 to 4 weeks past due on their payment, they immediately repossess the merchandise. When the merchandise is repossessed, it isn't inspected thoroughly and properly or even cleaned before it is placed back on the showroom floor to be sold again. Because of this, new customer's homes become infested with either roaches, fleas or even bedbugs. When the customer complains; Rent A Center denies it every time even when they know the customer is being honest. Upper management is not reasonable. As a store manager you are constantly under-staffed and expected to do the work of three people yourself. You will get reprimanded regardless of your job performance and even if you exceed expectations. As store managers, we were often instructed not to acknowledge good performances of our subordinates and to make them believe that they were constantly underachieving regardless of performance."
bad,Work productivity is over looked to accommodate favoritism of employees depending on district. Poor time management which result in consistant late nights while adjusting future work days to avoid ot pay.
bad,"NO LIFE NO FUTURE! Always working Friday/ Saturday/ Monday hours are horrid, it is a business that is going the way of the dinosaurs, so there is no long term future"
bad,"It's not some place you'd want to make a career at. Low pay, low hours, with little to no chance for advancement. "
bad,"Long hours and small pay. In the trucks a lot to collect money. If you cannot be a collector, this wont be a good job for you."
bad,"Met some great customers learned P&L - Profit and loss projections Rental agreements, wonderful past management some great co-workers the hardest part of the job was getting the merchandise back in good condition and on time payments the most enjoyable part of the job helping people that could not afford to pay"
bad,"Typical day how work was collection calls 3 times a day to customers that are past due, organizing sales floor, meeting sales expectations, managing part-time coworkers, collection runs, handling store's assets. Main thing I learned was you can always say no to a customer without being rude or disrespectful, basic just telling the customer to obey the contact they signed when the accepted the merchandise. Hardest part was Higher management having high expectations, store was always super under-staffed and was still one of the best stores in the district, usually the number one store and still something was wrong about the store. Store was never dirty and there were never complaints about employees or about the store in general and still higher management wasn't satisfied with the work done, so much that raises were so minimal. The most enjoyable part of the job is basically really working as a team, in this specific job if you cannot work as a team you will not only fail but it will not be a pleasant environment."
bad,My manager upset a customer then sent me on the repo and I was held at gunpoint.  I don't think there really is anything else that needs to be said.
bad,"Lots of heavy lifting, late nights, little pay. Dealing with customers who don't pay and are mad for you trying to get a payment."
bad,"Just be aware of what you're getting yourself into. If you're good at sales and don't have any sort of heart (you're basically renting things your renters can't really afford, but you have to make it seem like they can) then this is the perfect place for you."
bad,es una empresa buena pero con poca promocion de crecimiento dentro de la misma el ambiente es bueno con los compañeros pero la precion de parte de gerencia es en ocasiones exesiva para metas y resultados eso ase algo tedioso el trabajo lo bueno es que se te reconocen los logros pero no dan crecimiento ni bonificaciones por los buenos resultados
bad,"Unless you hate your family and love staying away from home, avoid this place like the plague. Ignore your schedule because you will never leave when you are supposed to."
bad,they don't pay for the job u do.. make u work on holidays.. they don't work with schedules.. company very unorganized.. hardest part of job is going on deliveries by ur self when there is 2 people that r supposed to b going.. the only good thing is that u get paid weekly.. management does wrong by giving merchandise to previous bad payers but company does not care that's why company is very bad..
bad,"I've been with the company for almost a full year. Still am not fully trained. District Managers only care about getting it done, but if you do not know how to or ask for help they will find a way to not help, or just don't know how to do it themselves. I have been hassled by a district manager for not working while punched out for my lunch several times."
bad,Physically demanding and goal oriented. Handled customer in store and in the field. Control of credit applications and past due accounts. Constant follow up on accounts. Inventory check in and returns are part of a the everyday tasks. Dependability on co-workers is a must in everyday dealings with customers.
bad,"The job description is very misleading, you will do way more than deliver to customer's residence. At the end of the week, after you've lost 20lbs carrying large and awkwardly shaped pieces of furniture up flights of stairs day after day, your part time check looks more like slave wages."
bad,"Business driven best renting merchandise and 4.5  times the cost of the product. Long hours and you do not get consecutive days off in a week. Upper management does not treat you like a valuable asset to the company, they treat you like a number that can replaced."
bad,"the management is not that good, the coworkers some are good others are not. the highlight of my work day was my breaks and clocking out."
bad,no quality of life worked 70 plus hrs weekly.build relationships with customers and employees
bad,This job is all about numbers. There is really no personal consideration for your customers or families. Same goes for employees and their families. EVERYTHING IS BUSINESS
bad,The most enjoyable part of the Job is the customer interaction.  You get to meet new people everyday.  The hardest part of the Job are the Extremely tight/short Deadlines imposed by District Management along with the Unrealistic Sales Goals which must me done with NO Excuses. Senior Management appears to not care of the employee's welfare by allowing District Management to Terrorize the Store Managers as well as all front line employees.
bad,Company does not care about there employees. A typical day at work consist off calling people all day to try to get money from them. My co-workers are awesome but my upper management if horrible.
bad,Awful place to work. Always told you can be replaced no matter how hard you work. Company doesnt understand you have a life outside of work. As a manager was no big deal to work 60 hours a week. Pay seems good but when you are salary you get screwed.
bad,No room for growth. Two weeks in the job I asked about promotions and managers seems to be bothered by it saying ''my time will come'' didnt enjoy answering questions and when asking i was pulled into the office and was told such things like '' you cant know more than the master''
bad,They do not care about family nor do they back their word on advancement.
bad,prepare for long hours no time for family and friends your Saturdays gone
bad,"I would absolutely never recommend that anyone work for the Rent A Center company. The entry level position is a Customer Account Representative, but you do much more than manage the customer accounts. The entry level employees are treated very poorly and not respected, even though they do the brunt of the work at the store level. The conditions that employees are expected to work in are very poor as well, which mostly has to do with going into homes of customers that would be considered unsafe. "
bad,"Teaches you to be a sales person like no other! Convince someone to buy an item for near double regular retail depending on its risk (i.e. a PS3 goes for double but a 55inch LED may only be 50% over). Tell them the benefits of having 90 days same as cash and then on day 91 get ready to explain that the 200 dollars they paid so far only reduced the ""cash price"" of their item by $88 or so. Once you put that fire out be prepared to explain why their early purchase option amount isn't going down by even half of the money they're putting into the item. So all said and done you can get your customer to pay $1440 for a PS3. Then use a coupon on the bottom of the certificate of ownership (a proud moment indeed) to convince them to do it all over again. The coupon is worth DOUBLE the $50 face value if you use it today! So that new 70inch TV that walmart sells for 1598, RAC has a used one tagged for 2280 you can get for the hot price of 2240 after the 100 coupon is applied! Wait?! 2280-2240 doesn't add up to 100! That's right because the coupon is taken off of the total number of payments so again subject to the equation of your money divided by 2.26= how much is going toward your product. Your in a near constant state of conflict resolution and if you've put out all the fires then your busy getting new customers to come in and start the process of pushing the ""value"" of the 90 day SAC program then calming them down when they either find the item for much less elsewhere or miss the 90 day time frame or both. Once you succeed in this job you can sell sand in the sahara!"
bad,"steady work, low pay.  Your scheduled for 49 hours per week standard and you will find yourself there 55 to 60 hours which leaves no time to live  They also give 2 days off which is Wed. and Sun. usually and you are never able to get fully rested."
bad,"If ur married....forget this.jobs! My kid starting failing at school, fighting,.he needed attention! I was working from 8:30-9:00 every day except thrs. And sunday...managment is HORRIBLE I quit because of sexual harrasment from the manager, I told the district manager, and he didnt do anything about it...sad that I worked my butt of for almost a year as a sales manager, and didnt really get anything in return..."
bad,"I worked at RAC for about a year and half, but it only took me a few months to figure out how crooked this company is. When your ""hurting for a job"" they definitely know how to lure you in, then the smoke clears and you can truly see the mistake you made. Benefits suck, NO vacay the first year, then only 10days after 1year employment. Only 2 (TWO) sick days off per year. You work EVERY Saturday, ALL DAY 830a-6ish. Insurance policy $32/wk for non smokers, $44 for smokers and that's and individual policy. The hardest part??! Selling over priced living rooms, washers, and tvs to the old and/or less educated in your community. The company values or only worth the cheap paper they're printed on. Would NOT recommend this to a friend or family member AT ALL. If you like overtime this is a great place to be, 11-12hour days with 1hour lunch break. If you are just looking for a check and no real advancement, this is the place for you. My former boss has dedicated nearly 10 years and still reports to an area manager hired a couple years ago from outside the company."
bad,In my time at rent-a-center. The management never teach anything about how or way things are done. they expect you to know it just by watching badly made training videos that don't show you how to perform daily tasks. the company sets unrealistic sales quotas week.
bad,"Currently not much upward mobility. Sit down and get your work done. As far as training, not much is available. Good work environment if you want a steady job."
bad,"you must know how to drive boxtruck, and control road rage. but the calling of customers for the porpose of late contracts should be controled by people other then delivery drivers. i enjoyed the hands on sales and customer service part of the job. but management part of the store did nothing but write up rental contracts. they felt they were to important to do any labor."
bad,Bad is not being appreciated and long hours. I’ve been working three years and am getting the same pay as new employees. The company make you choose work or home life.
bad,"Don’t work for rent a center in Clinton tn. The manager treats his employees and customers like nothing! Slams phones, doors, and objects including merchandise. I stayed for over a year because I had a family to support and it was brought up more than once and no one ever did anything but make excuses for him! Ridiculous company! Even customers begged for him to leave!"
bad,"Good company  in general to work with."
bad,"If you don't have kids and don't mind working long hours, this job is for you. If you enjoy being pushed to meet unattainable sales and statistics goals this job is for you. If you like management fudging numbers to meet sales goals only to then get in trouble when numbers aren't met because of fake sales, this job is for you. If you like going into dirty houses, this job is for you. On the bright side the di pay well, and. Do give regular raises. Pris:pay cons: poor work life balance and poor work environment"
bad,"I worked at ALTAIR Global full-time for more than a year"
bad,"I worked at Rent A Center for 3 years and been promoted from within. If you're smart it can be very easy but boring. Daily you have to meet sales goal and"
bad,"No work home life balance. Job threats on a weekly basis. Management needs to huddle up and figure out how to correctly manage there employees, once that is done it could be a better place to work"
bad,Rent-A-Center is a difficult place to work if you have a family and especially if you have children.  They give no time off for school events.........
bad,Very diversified working environment. Good employees always nice and friendly. Always so clean and fresh conditions.Was a great location to work to get to.
bad,"don't get sick"
bad,"The work itself is not hard at all. Load and unload appliances and furniture in the truck, make calls, take payments, etc. What really got under everyone's skin was the management. They were so unorganized and the day to day operations change without warning. The constant barrage berating and belittling from the management in the store were dreadful. Employees were usually on edge, the hours were long. Go in around 9:30-10 and leave around 8:30 five days a week. Weekly paychecks were nice but the 45+ hours a week were not."
bad,"Rent-A-Center provides a job with consistently changing conditions. Unfortunately, this makes a career feel unfamiliar. Responsibilities can change from month to month, but expectations remain high. Compensation does not correlate with increasing responsibilities and the shortened schedule."
bad,"Working 9am-7pm wasn't for me. The job was very demanding on certain people. In the morning I'd make make calls, Take lunch. Then come back and load the truck to start the days deliveries/Pick ups. While everyone else is playing on their phones"
bad,"This company has shown me the ugly side of sales. I started this job as a place to kind of get my foot in the door into what I thought would be a valuable life changing experience in a place that I believed would value me as a worker. What I actually found was a company that Thrives in the unhappiness of its coworkers."
bad,"My day consist of chasing customers who would not make payments, had guns pulled on me, dogs chased, disrespectful customers and management did not care, was sent back out to retrieve merchandise. Was made to deliver product in rain, with no proper covering. No regard for hours, made to stay late with no O/T, but they went home hours before store closed."
bad,"Solía ser buena empresa, sin embargo desde que se independizó de estados unidos se perdió lo bueno que tenia, ahora todo se basa en que le caigas bien al director o distrital, aun cuando logres excelentes resultados y lo demuestres en indicadores, si les caes mal, harán lo que sea para hostigarte. Existe mucho acoso y muchas para ""lograr una promoción"" acceden a favores sexuales."
bad,There is no real sense of management everyone is so scatter brained that nothing gets done. Everything gets put on the sales manager and if it doesn’t get don’t it always falls back to being their fault.
bad,"Your taught one way how to go about dealing with customers especially on the side of collections, but when you go to do that job one way, you're told you're doing it wrong. Not a job for anyone who doesn't like having to bother people to pay their bill or collect their merchandise after the way the sale agreement was gone through was not thorough."
bad,"Worked a long time to be a AM, company is being bought out and was put to do same strenuous work i sought promotion to escape. Im am unable to keep up with the physical demands currently demanded of me, and i have spoke up several time to no avail."
bad,Not a good company. They don't care about there employee. They told you things that was not true they lie about taking care of the employees. Manager won't respond to the employees it's crazy
bad,The job consists of renting furniture and appliances to people that have very little money then trying to collect the money weekly. Delivery of heavy furniture all day and picking up the same items weeks later.
bad,"When I started at RAC I thought it was great.  As I advanced the more reporting, and nonsense tracking forms we had to do.  As a manager you have to do just about everything including everyone else's job below you.  The sales assistants had it the easiest as they didn't have to do much of anything.  So if you get hired on stay an assistant."
bad,Long as you can work together its a great job but when certain people don't get their way they turn . The job was great and I enjoyed the partnership with the other company. They were great to work with.
bad,Rent-A-Center is always pushing for sales but does very little to find new customers. The focus is almost always on generating more revenue from existing customers. Most Rent-A-Center clients are lower income families. Constantly going back to existing customers without allocating more resources to new customers proves to be ineffective.
bad,"Management is poor; there is a new manager in the store. He likes to favor employees and throw the rest under his feet like a rug. Not well managed, very unreliable"
bad,I delivered furniture as well as did pick-ups.There were times that furniture needed to be fixed and I did that as well. I had to call all the Spanish-speaking families to ensure that payment arrangements were done.
bad,"the hours are too long, you become a mover; you have to carry and build sofas, beds, ect. up flights of stairs if they dont have an elevator.  your push to sell while having to be able to deliver products."
bad,In the Cleveland area this job is stressful and dangerous. If you don't speak Spanish then your chances of advancing past a certain point are minimal.
bad,"Don't do it. RAC allows for zero work life balance. Especially once you've become a store manager. There is a ludicrous ""rule"" that if you miss your numbers your day off is taken away. Therefore you will be opening and closing Monday to Saturday. Cycle repeats itself every time you slip up. VERY demanding job not for everyone."
bad,"Demasiada exigencia en cosas que no hay control de ellas, te ofrecen un buen salario pero al momento de trabajar el sueldo se queda pequeno en contra de las exigencies."
bad,"if your not interested in practically begging people to buy from you then you don't want to work here. all the sales assistant managers were female, and its because we had to sell. telemarketing was what you did for most of your day trying to get customer to come and get accounts, hated it"
bad,"With a Non Consistent sense of Direction Giving from Corporate on down, trying to keep a group of Store Manager engaged and exciting about a business where there is High risk, of  external theft, and judgement. However the best part is the team that you work for, and what they will do to go above and beyond to increase sales and hitting standard."
bad,Can be laid back and fun but can also be stressful and competitive. Everyone got along for the most part but can be tension in the closing part of the month.
bad,"It at first seems like this is a gretat job but then the constant drama, that even if you aren't involved messes up your position, the communication is not the best, its a big blame game. You also have nearly no job security the year I was there we went through nearly 12 employees in different positions lost 2 managers another 2 got demoted and full time could gett switched to part time at will!!"
bad,"This is one of those jobs where you are terribly overworked and underpaid. As a customer service representative you are to do collection calls, write leases, sell customers on the program, maintain all sorts of audit trails, complete file verifications, and much more. Plus since you work 40 hours and your manager works 50, they schedule you to close every night and you work every weekend. All for the starting rate of $10/hr and working your way up to $11.25 in 2 years. Terrible job but luckily I had the best direct manager that I've had at any job."
bad,"Okay place to work, not a career. Goo if you are waiting to go back to school. Money is good but the hours suck. Would not send my buddies in to work there."
bad,long hours with no flex time. salary not commiserate with demands. I did not enjoy working there. Especially toward the end of my stay. Glad it was over.
bad,"It's an ok job to begin with. However, you'll get tired of it eventually. 45 hour work weeks, over scheduled days, and budget cuts so most stores are understaffed. Management is bad. Managers play favorites."
bad,Can be a good job if you wanna take it up the butt. Management is lazy and incompetent. Management makes you do their job while they play on their phone. Customers do not abide by their contract. Most rent merchandise just to steal. Most furniture that is returned has bed bugs/roaches in it. Rent a Center is a ripoff. Save your money but at Wally World.
bad,"The money is good once you get to the management level, but the misery of having to deal with the toxic upper management directly is hardly worth it.  The hours suck, and make it difficult to have a life outside of work. You will miss family gatherings, kids sports games and concerts.  You will regularly deal with having to reposes things like furniture, refrigerators, and stoves. However, if you don't mind constant conflict at work, and don't have much of a life this would be the job for you."
bad,"overworked"
bad,"In the district that I worked, we had a ""boss"" that was taking great pride in ""cleaning house"" of most fellow contemporaries that were employed from 2 years on. He either chased them off, or dismissed them. While I was employed, we had a running joke that our ""boss"" was so insecure, that he would dismiss ANYONE who may be a threat to him and/ or his position. Nothing was ever good enough... if credit was good, then the number of our accounts was not as impressive as he would want... or visa-versa. We (as employees) were instructed to NOT give the ""full truth"" to prospective customers, as this might detour their signing on a contract with us. On a positive note, there WERE those customers that made it worth while. If I were to guess, about 20% of our customers were a pleasure to work with, and the rest (in my area) were ""problem children"", where we had to track them down to either acquire payments, or regain our product. As a Collection Specialist, there always seemed to be friction between us and the Rent-a-Center store, as far as dropping off re-acquired product from customers to a store location. As I say...If you ""live to work"", with not a lot of personal life to be concerned with.... this job is alright, but there IS a lot of lifting and loading."
bad,"Excellent pay but you a lot of overtime, I mean way to much, try 60hr week too much.Never enough time for family. Also the company focuses on numbers rather than experience and it damages overall  work environment."
bad,"the team in the store i work in are always arguing "
bad,"at work by 9-10 am"
bad,"A typical work day involves long hours, high pressure to get sales, and having to deal with difficult people both internally and externally."
bad,"nothing negative nothing good, poor management, no team work, hardest part of the job carriying furniture"
bad,As a CDL driver this is way to much work for one man . Lots a lifting and grantee no help loading or unloading truck way to much paper work
bad,typical 10-12 hour days selling overpriced merchandise to people who could hardly afford it. Middle management never satisfied with your performance. Hardest part of the job was getting customers to make payments they couldn't afford.
bad,"You are promised the world. If you work hard you will get promoted and become manager. That they only look for leaders. ALL LIES. The harder you work in your store, the worse for you. You are promoted to assistant manager and then you stay as.such forever. No matter how hard you work, if your store.doesnt do well then u dont. The managers in this company are full of thenselves. These managers are low class, uneducated people that never dreamed of earning over 30k a year, let alone run a store,or supposedly run a store . They motivate using fear tactics and bribes. If you value your job you must perform always. Sell sell sell sell...they take advantage of the low income customer. This company only wants you to get money, no matter what. Rent and collect. "
bad,"The only plus to this job was my co-workers. RAC is always talking about their company pilicies, helping others,  and holding a high standard. Talking is about all they're good for might as well not be any standards or policies. I sure have never seen any followed. If you care nothing about having a life other then work and your employer having no sympathy for the fact you want a life then this is the job for you. If you like things other then work. They pay poor yet want to hold you to an extremely high standard of work and also hold your job over your head. I highly suggest taking the time to find something atleast slightly better. "
bad,I'm an assistant manager at RAC and i hate it. Its good pay but that is the only good thing about the company. I wouldn't recommend anyone working here
bad,"I thought my job was good and I enjoyed it. Some employees were not up to par, and made much more work than necessary."
bad,"I started having major anxiety from the pressure the District Managers and the Company put on you. They talk to you and treat you like a ignorant toddler. The pay is great but you work 12+ hours a day 2 days a week. No time for children, family, etc."
bad,Working for Rent a center was a long and stressful job. You can expect to work one day for 12 hours when your only supposed to be there for 9 hours and when you are told you have to do extra hours it almost close to the time you are about to get off. your actual work hours a week is supposed to be 48 hours but you can expect to work upwards to 55 to 60. you have very little personal life and your only allowed a 30 min lunch break unless the managers says other wise.
bad,"A typical day at work is an 11 hour shift with a 30 min break 3 to 4 hours after you get there. Depending on the store/people you work with expect someone to look over your shoulder constantly. The district manager micro-manages the stores. The hardest part of the job is trying to force people to pay what they don't have or taking items that they need i.e. stove, bed, fridge. Also you tele-market to your same customers daily. The most enjoyable part of the job is the co-workers depending on who you're working with."
bad,"This job does not have any redeeming factors, it is difficult, mind numbing and you may be thrown in with incompetent managers that will make your life miserable"
bad,I started out really enjoying the data entry responsibilities.   No interaction with team members.  Felt tied to desk 100%.  Bad environment for all..
bad,Not a happy employee at all. Company needs to revamp the work place and management training. Poor Leadership. They should train managers with more personal development to lead by example and not just talking and demanding.
bad,"this job is horrible , collections part is the worst not quality of like 9am-8pm"
bad,"Rentacenter is a good company with good benefits,just gotta b ready to give urself to the team cause there gonna need u cause there's gonna b alotta time"
bad,"The pay is good for management because the salary starts at 48k but hourly employees there's almost no garunteed home life except Sundays and but if you like living at work and don't mind bed bugs and roaches ETC."
bad,Nothing to say was not organized or reliable management was not very good just not a very good place to work worked with customers building furniture putting furniture together
bad,"The pay is reasonable for the work, but the benefits are low. Calling out on a shift because of emergency or sickness is difficult and there is little wiggle room because of the small staff."
bad,"Work everyday except off say and Sunday. Work 9 or 10am to 7:30 or later, manager over pack schedule so breaks sometimes be 5pm and paid only 12 for all the lifting and store hours"
bad,"Although the pay is pretty good and you’re pretty much guaranteed Sunday’s off, the job is very demanding and completely thankless. Where hourly employees have their times strictly monitored and need to control overtime, even if you are shorthanded, salaried managers are expected to basically be at the stores all the time, especially if any of your “key metrics” are out of line, which happens frequently at many locations because you are relying on a customer base that typically is unreliable."
bad,"a typical day of work consists of phone calls all day and deliveries to different cities such as tehachapi, ridgecrest, california city, ventura, oxnard, sylmar, simi valley; telemarketing, sales in store, and promoting sales and events"
bad,No life for your family schedule is off job is ok but becomes very overwhelming. The environment can be a good place to work but at times the pressure and lack of knowledge by the higher ups can cause a lot of discomfort
bad,This job would be great for anybody just starting out but be aware that you are expendable. If you can find the right district manager like I had it's a breeze in the park but most district managers break your back for not enough money
bad,Management was terrible. No teamwork whatsoever. Tools were lost and treated terribly. Only would get 20 hours a week hard to make a living from rent a center
bad,Rent a center is a decent place to work. It all depends on the manager at the time. Previous manager was about  family and after work changes the new manager made bad changes.
bad,"The pay and benefits offered are great, but there is little room for advancement based on hard work and the culture encourages little cooperation between the sales team and the collections team."
bad,Pay is well. Great place to work. The only issue is the collections aspect as there is absolutely no leverage what so ever and you are held accountable.  You can only do so much. We place phone calls and do field visits. However if there is no answer at the house or no contact via telephone there is no further action taken and you are reprimanded as if though you haven't tried to collect the debt the customer has outstanding . The sales side however is completely different the only issue I have with this side is there should be some sort of a bonus structure. Other than that rent acenter is a decent paying decent job .I'm looking for a better opportunity though and there is really not much room for advancement within this particular company
bad,This company isn't a fair company. Managers are very lazy and never want to help and do anything. They leave all the hard work and labor to the customer account representatives. They want you to do the deliveries and do their job for them as well which isn't fair. Most of them are getting paid for nothing just to sit around. I wouldn't recommend anyone to work for this company!!
bad,"Rent a Center was a great job at the beginning but they do stress sales and the job is very time consuming you work 48 hrs per week and sale goal's must be met per store. "
bad,There are so many rules broken in the company that it makes me very uncomfortable to even be in the building sometimes. The way that the associates talk to and about each other and the customers is the most unprofessional place I have ever worked. The hours of work are not bad and it is great to have all holidays off and paid. That is probably the only good thing about this company. The higher management does nothing to stop the way things are happening. There is theft that is shoved under the rug and complete disregard for rules.
bad,"Bad place to work. No overtime, bad management and no possibilities to advance your career. Will never go back to this place. Production and sales are more important that employees at this company."
bad,"no hay motivacion, trabajo en equipo, retroalimentacion."
bad,"No room for development"
bad,"The job has a lot of flaws, but the people u meet and the bonds you have with your customers I will never take back! Prices and communication with customers should be worked on!"
bad,"Rent-a-Center had a lot of potential, but very bad management. As a result, the company is in a downward spinal. With better management it would be a very nice place to work. Also wages need to increase, or hours. This review applies to the main repair center in Bolingbrook, Illinois."
bad,"I worked as a sales manager for a year and a half. I have no idea how I lasted that long. Ridiculous expectations without any recognition or fair compensation for your sacrfices. I decided to quit on the day a sales meeting was scheduled on the day of my daughter's surgery, and I was still expected at the sales meeting. I am a single mother so felt I had no choice. I attended the meeting, but realized that day I could not work for people who would pressure a single mother that way. I gave notice a few days later. If a certain percentage of customers has not paid their bill, you will be expected to stay at work an extra 2 or 3 hours. Customers are taken advantage of as well. This is not the place for anyone with a moral compass at all. It got harder and harder to ""sale"" single mothers on social security refrigerators for $3000 especially when Rent A Center only paid $800 for them and someone else had already rented it and paid $2500 into it. They not only take advantage of their customers, but their employees as well."
bad,El ambiente de trabajo era bueno aquí el detalle que no me parecía era que las horas de trabajo el día eran muchos eran demasiado y no dejaba tanto tiempo para pasar con la familia
bad,"This is not the workplace to work if you are part-time and in college or some type of academical facility. I think the lunches that are given to part time workers are unfair. Being that part timers have to do all the heavy lifting deliver and merchandise in rain or shine. while full time workers get a full hour lunches for staying in the store and sitting on their bottoms for a whopping nine hours. The hardest part about the job is dealing with customers who are late. If you can not handle being cursed at or attempting to repossess furniture, this job is not for you."
bad,"You may be responsible for opening up the store a hour before opening. "
bad,"Management is a joke, if you aren't a favorite amongst the other employees you'll know it, the amount of stress you have to deal with hitting certain numbers every week when sometimes it's literally out of your control with drive you insane."
bad,"You will deal with roaches and bedbugs. Anyone who says you won't, is lying. You will have to deliver and pick up from some of the filthiest residences you will ever see. Dirt, feces, rotten food, mold, roach clusters (yes, that is a thing), needles, drug residue, and smells you will never be able to forget are all part of a typical day."
bad,Never will work for them again..no hours and the pay is no good for what you do daily..not to clean with bed bugs or roaches on furniture..management is not that great
bad,The company is going through a painful process related to going private at the moment. The current leadership does not appear to value technology or IT.
bad,"Two thumbs down.  Long hours. Low pay. Lots of unrealistic goals, little or no reward for outstanding performance   Company is only focused on the dollar and not the employee. Lots of good people have left or have been fired for unfair or wrong reasons"
bad,I worked here for 2 plus years. I worked more than 12 hour days and was under paid and over worked. My apse was preparing for a deployment and I had to almost quit just to spend time with her.
bad,"If you have a family, kiss them good bye. Start at 8am don't get out until 8pm or later depending on the way the day is going. I wouldn't recommend unless you a single person and you have very thick skin."
bad,Fast paced competitive work Environment Long hours never know what is going to happen on a day to day basis  there's diversity You meet a lot of interesting people
bad,"When you work for rent a center you do not have anytime with your family, you are at work from morning till night and only get a 30 minute lunch. There are no breaks throughout the day besides lunch and you have to call people all the time and try to force them to buy something."
bad,The environment of this work place was heavily influenced by meeting quotas.  As such everyone worked in fear of not meeting their quotas.  Not meeting quotas was a certain performance appraisal criteria.
bad,"I worked at Rent-A-Center as a seasonal job during the end of the year, it was a good job but the manager was very poor at his job which made it hard to work at that location."
bad,Management is dishonest and uncooperative. The hours are extremely too long for part-time employees. The work environment is hostile and has a heavy air of tension that is pugnant with desperation from both customers and employees.
bad,There isn't any kind of job security at all. Actually the longer you work there the better chance of them finding a way to fire you. If you want to make a career out of a job look some place else.
bad,"Long hours, stressful account management, unprofessional staff and management, Cut throat collections, high terms on products, good at screwing over customers and taking advantage of low income neighborhoods and communities. Avoid at all cost"
bad,"it's an ok job itself but there's no security in work and it's a dying business. the way they do there business is very unprofessional by making passive aggressive comments to customers and even going as far as arguing with them. it's pretty ""ghetto"" for lack of better words."
bad,"You have the potential to earn a descent salary, but the discrimination with this company is atrocious and is very clear to see...Strenuous labor demands"
bad,"I was wrongful fired for supposedly bringing fleas into the office because I have a dog. The company has entitled managers who think they are better then everyone else. Don't waste your time renting from or working for this company they tell you, your easily replaced."
bad,"Hard to manage work and family unless you can get a good schedule, took 4 years. Management is poor, will let just about anyone promote to position if they don't have someone qualified."
bad,"A typical day at work would consist of several challenges. First we would go down a list of people and call them to collect a payment or to schedule a pickup. Once all of that was taken care of then we would go down another list and take care of our deliveries since it was a furniture store. I would have to carry large heavy objects into vehicles and most of the time we would have to carry them up several flights of stairs since most of our customers lived in apartment complexes. Once that was done, if there was any time left in the day then we would go out and knock on customers doors that had past due payments. So basically we would go around trying to collect our merchandise or get a payment up front. If I was in the store I was also required to make sells on the floor. Greet and attend anyone who walked in and attempt to set them up with a plan so they can rent or buy an overpriced used or new product."
bad,"The company has been on a steady decline for the past two years now. You can expect to work all day every day harassing customers to pay and getting yelled at by management because they didn't want make a payment or return the merchandise. "
bad,Collections culture is bad. Customers with bad credit are often overloaded with payments they are unable to make in order to maintain stores balance on rent.
bad,I disliked working here very much.... no overtime allowed... no family time.. want u to work till 10pm every night.........................................
bad,Did not believe in what I was doing at all. After I made it to management I found out how this place worked more for less . The absolute worst people are the district managers they will do anything to keep the job that they cut everyone's throat to get !
bad,A business that is stuck in the past. Resistant to new ideas and change. A business model that will be significantly reduced due to a changing market place.
bad,Been working for this company for 5 years. the company do not care if you have family. the upper manager are not understanding. the stores need cameras. I put a lot of time and effort in this company and got nothing in return.
bad,A typical day at work was like being with your family.  Thats what made the days all the more easy.  The most enjoyable part of my day was helping out low income families with something they could afford that would help them out for years to come
bad,"Hard job, lots of hard labor, low pay, management was crooked and you were required to work insane hours. If you need to make money to pay the bills then go for it, but if you can find something else......"
bad,"Too much pressure, not enough support for coworkers and software not reliable to complete daily tasks. Management cover up too many issues of integrity and make biased decisions."
bad,This company may seem like it's a good place to work ...but becareful... it's not all great as it seems ... they pretty much hire anyone and can put anyone into management...let me put it this way ...professional or not... I had a good start but things went side ways quick....goals are not realistic... and the motto is not represented the way it's supposed to be... but yes I learn to increase my management experience even through all the crazy stuff!!
bad,Upper Management doesn't know what work and family balance is.....they figure hey we will cut you down to 40 hours and raise your pay.....but they don't raise it enough for you to remain making what you were.....they say they are giving you more time with family but they are really just trying to find a way to save money and have you approve of it.
bad,Lots of paper work and high Interest rate. Loved to sale to the customer when they came in to get thing for their home. Glad we didn't do credit checks so we could help who don't have good credit.
bad,"Not only have I worked at Rent A Center, I have over ten friends and associates who have also worked there in different locations. The conclusion I have come up with not only from my own experience, but their input as well, is not good. Management is okay at best, the work pace can be either at a stand still, or very hectic. The hours can be hectic as well, as well as the psychical work required. In my time there I was regularly required to move couches, refrigerators, and other appliances with either no or very little help. The environment is not good either, the coworker relations left a lot to be desired, and the customer base was typically rude, sometimes downright hostile. I was threatened multiple times in the time I was there. I also now have to go to psychical therapy to recover from the labor intensity, and I'm relatively built to begin with. I would not recommend this job for anyone who wants to actually have a chance at progress, this is a dying company in a dying industry. The benefits are an unfunny joke. There is a co-worker referral program, yet I never got the reward after having taken advantage of the program. The training is awful, I was just given the keys to a large cube truck after watching a five minute outdated video. Take this job as an in-between, but keep looking for something else even after being hired. I wish I could go back and take my own advice and save myself some neck, hip, and back pain."
bad,"People are good work env Ok and work load is normal"
bad,"Wouldn't recommend this company to work for simply for the job security alone, meaning your position isn't secure and you can be fired at any second"
bad,"Not worth it. The co-workers were cool, but management was unorganized. Not to mention when they send you out on deliveries, you're by yourself most of the time picking up heavy items, and when you take too long to come back they get on you about it. Maybe if I had help I'd get the job done faster. Sorry but I'm not going to risk my health just so the managers won't get in trouble. I have worked from 39 hours a week to the next week only 8 hours. Very uneven schedule, I get the point of the store needing you according their sales, but they can't just have you work 1 day from the entire week, then when you get back the following week you will have to clean and oeganize the mess that the co workers did, because they send them out to do deliveries as well, and not care about cleaning up or having an organized workspace."
bad,This job included lifting and hauling furniture. I learned that i wasn't cut out for such activities. I ended up with nerve damage in my shoulder. Management was ok. My co-workers were all men. Hard to compete with that. The hardest part of my job was the lifting. I enjoyed the customers and social interaction.
bad,"Rent A Center is a high volume  rent to own company that specializes in home furnishings, appliances. There are account collections to be done, sales and deliveries."
bad,"It is pretty sad that this company has District Managers working for them that do not know how to train or coach there employees..All mine knew how to do is sit either at his house or at his office and pass out threats to fire you everyday..Last i worked for the company for 6 yrs and cleaned up more than 6 stores and opened 2 new ones...On Feb 4th was asked to the District Managers office and was given a pathetic reason after all that i have done for this company that i was no longer needed and was told it was cause i was Disrespectful and that he didn't really need to give me a reason cause i was just a number in Rent A Centers High  as ever turnover...This company has anywhere from 1 to 8 Store Manager openings everyday..That is sad...If you are considering to work for this company you might want to reconsider ...They make it very stressful and you won't know if you have a job tomorrow,, As you see mine release wasn't for performance,it's cause he made it personal..What a joke of a company"
bad,There is a sever lack of staffing trying to save move but work the employees 48 plus hours a week without fair pay. There should be more safety equipment
bad,"This store was a fun place to work for until the Store Manager had enough of the District and Regional managers only caring about their bonuses, and quit. Since then the District Manager has hired a replacement Store Manager with finger and ear tattoos. I'm not against tattoos but this is someone who's supposed to be professional. She is very under experienced as well. "
bad,"The first several years were challenging, but each store was given more autonomy in finding ways to succeed. Each person felt a personal responsibility towards the team achievements. In the later years, the culture across the board became very different. Even as there were more ""we're a team"" catch phrases, upper management clearly showed nothing but disdain for what was happening at the store level. All upper management ever seemed concerned with were bottom line numbers - mostly focused on protecting shareholder profit without regard to the sacrifices being made at the store level."
bad,"Great co-workers, however worked beyond what I consider acceptable (at least in our store). "
bad,from the time that you enter work until you leave there is a constant uphill battle to produce result while managing service and customer. Every coworker has a understanding of how to get the job done it just the amount of work that has to be done since all tasks are inhouse. The management is constantly up and down with expectation. Decent pay due to overtime pay. Company is attempting to improve work life balance by hiring on part time work and 49 hour coworkers.
bad,"This is a great job for anyone that doesn't have a family. Fun work environment you get to experience a lot of on the road activities such as deliveries, repos,  and service calls. This job is all about the numbers so stay focus learn as much as you can."
bad,"Work would begin with all employees making sales calls for about an hour. Followed by deliveries and account updates."
bad,"Arriving at the store at 9am to make sure it was open by 10am.Then make sure the bank deposit was ready to go to the bank ,and get the cash draw ready for the day to day operations also made sure my staff understood there pacific goals for the day. Proceeded to do business by selling of merchandise, open up new rental agreements ,doing collection procedures by calling past due customers ,receiving in new merchandise for the store by adding it to the inventory, and much more. The end of the day I would make sure the cash draw was placed into the safe enter the end of the day procedures into the computer on high touch set the alarm lock the gates and the work day is over. What I learned : Hiring of staff ,training of staff ,inventory management ,P&L ,customer service ,placing orders for new merchandise and receiving in new merchandise and putting it on to the inventory ,stocking and balancing of the merchandise ,also placing merchandise into service if need ,receiving merchandise from service and placing it back on to the inventory ,Management: always changing.  Co-workers: good and bad . Hardest par of the job collections"
bad,no team work and bad treatment in the jobs no consideration for the employees. no comunication between the managers and the distric manager and hr offices
bad,"Rac is very long and drawn out hours. Days off are not back to back . They expect you to wear many hats and do everything in an unreasonable amount of time. Theres simply not enough to geteverything done in one day ,"
bad,"The management at the time of my employment was horrible, workers did not have a good work life experience. There was very little room for advancement and there was no loyaly at this company towards it's employees."
bad,"Left because they were cutting hours, no time to get things done that needed done and didn't like the direction things were heading"
bad,A typical day consists of lots of busy work and collection calls is your credit isn't in order. Employees are undervalued and underappreciated.
bad,"This task is comparable to a dog chasing it's tail, Merchandise rented, then returned or picked up for lack of payment, then returned to same consumer? Brilliant!"
bad,"Rent a center was a good company to work for. The job is not for everyone long hour, hard work"
bad,It's a decent job you will be required to do a lot of work for little praise. So if you don't mind working for basically only pay it's perfect. Customers hate you and will yell at you daily cause they don't want to pay for what they get. You will have people try to lie and steal from you. Not a good place to work.
bad,You charge people three worth the things their getting pressure on closing account and getting people to pay their bills collections team is weak high turn over
bad,Guarantee 48 to 50 hours a week and weekly pay which I loved both. The job is really not that hard I had a wonderful store manager but I don't like a job where you have no time to spend time with your family maybe it's because I a single parent mother. If you aren't use to lifting and moving things then that would be the hardest part of this job.
bad,Stores bash each other just to get sales. Bad bed bug Break outs.
bad,"The major focus of my job was to manage my customer accounts. A typical workday began with phone calls to all customers with past due accounts. I would either set up future payment commitments or schedule a merchandise pick up on all defaulted agreements. Throughout the day I would make new deliveries and merchandise pick-ups."
bad,"Work from 8am to 8pm most of the time."
bad,learned that having a gun held to my head for furniture is not worth it to loose my life
bad,"Most management should not be in the position that they are, (vulgar, uncaring, leaving early, not helpful)"
bad,"I had a mixed experience with RAC. When I started it was great, I worked hard and made a lot of money.  I was promoted quickly, going from a delivery driver to a store manager within 8 months. I opened a brand new store and it took off and did really well. Six months after I opened my store, the company did a re-structure and fired 60 District Managers. When my new DM came in, I found that she was very keen on favoritism (one of her store managers opened the same day as me and grew less than half as quickly, yet she was asked to open another location again and I wasn't even considered). It was one favoritism issue after another and she eventually fired 3 store managers (or ran them to the point of quitting) and replaced them with people from her old district.  I was eventually told that if I didn't start working my day off due to high collection numbers (better than the other stores including her shining star's) I would ""be waiting in the unemployment line"". Eventually I decided that eating the money I personally spent moving to open up this location and move home. Overall, it was not just my immediate supervisor, but the line of supervisors all the way to the top that care nothing about employees but numbers only.  We did get to have hotdogs on customer appreciation events, though."
bad,"not to bad of a company"
bad,"Marketed merchandise, micro management is a must. I learned how to sale your soul. Store manager was difficult to understand. The hardest part was to recover merchandise from those that did not pay.  Physical labor will keep you in shape."
bad,"Sales "
bad,The rental structure is a plot to exploit unwealthy people. The management sets unrealistic goals. A lot of turn-over with employees and unethical managemnt practices. Not a good work environment.
bad,"I learned working at rent a center that big corperations are all about  making money they arent for the workers. i worked there  over 5 years i worked off the clock so my managers wouldnt get in  trouble for the over time. and when my car down and i asked to take a week vacation that i deserved i was denied and when i asked to transfer i was denied then let go because i couldnt get there"
bad,"A typical day involves hitting nothing but numbers. This includes calling past due accounts, picking up and delivering merchandise, running past due accounts, getting sales in and out of the store. Customer Account Reps have a lot of side responsibilities and stay busy throughout long vigorous days from 8a-730pm and 10a-730p."
bad,Typical day.... meet your numbers or be fired...
bad,"met some great people here, i enjoyed the ability to build relationships with my customers."
bad,Do you realize that RAC laid off over 60 upper management employees in 2012 in which doing so was slightly over the same amount in money that the CEO and all the VPs got in their raise. They're a sneaky and conniving company that thrives on the poor to line their pockets with gold. They take advantage of their employees by working them extreme hours not allowing any personal or family time..expect hours such as 830am-8pm. They're a $3 billion dollar company that will not and does not care what so ever about their employees. The most enjoyable day was when I packed my office up for the last time.
bad,"Need to balance your time between trianing people on collections and sale. We did all our collections in house and were responsilble to carry less then 5.9% past due each week. At the same time keep profits up and cost down while reaching our daily sales goals. Ten to twelve hours a day was normal.What I learned was how to read and motivate people or customers.I feel I had a lot of respect from my co-workers and fellow mangers. The hardest part of the job was balance(traing, sales, collections,ext.). The most enojoyable was to reach our daily goals and to have over a dozen people promoted."
bad,"A typical day at work for me consisted of me doing deliveries all day long. Since I was the new employee, I was often bossed around and was respected like my co workers. I did learn more about the company I was working for ,and I also learned that management did not really care for the workers. The hardest part of the job was actually working with my co workers. Whenever they made mistakes, they would often blame me since I was the newest worker. The most enjoyable part of the job was making the customers happy."
bad,"once you start working there, you are practically owned by them meaning you will have no life once your day is done because of the long work hours. hard to go to school because your body will be sore . there will be times you will be in the store by yourself for a couple hours, phone ringing off the hook, taking payments, selling etc..."
bad,"Rent A Center is a company best worked at if you are single and have no family or significant others at home. Although the pay is good , you will be spending 95% of your week at work , working long shifts .. the only good thing about this job is guranteed pay at the end of the week . Co-workers are ok ..Management was ok..outside of the SM , lying to customers about products and leaving co-workers to fend for themselves , taking out lunches ..when employees were unable tot ake a lunch"
bad,"The projects were challenging, very good experience, But the culture a little too strict and stiff. No work life balance. Not good for working moms. Poor senior management. unrealistic expectations Expect you to work extra over time. No real effort made to develop employees. Data warehouse was pretty organized had a few quality issues but overall in good condition. Could have been a good place to work if senior management views and attitudes were different."
bad,"DM I worked for was distrustful, However previous managers and time spent with the company was rewarding. Company has good values but is not reflected in older management staff"
bad,"was not what i expected , very long hours for low pay and poor working conditions"
bad,Excellent place for someone who is single to work. Recently turned down promotion due to the lack of family time I would have. Did not go over well with higher ups :(
bad,"Actual job duties were not too difficult. The company under pays their employees for the level of work and amount of hours they expect you to work. Also, having only four employees is stressful when people are not getting along with one another. Also, not much room for advancement unless you're willing to travel/relocate."
bad,"It's a great job for a single person, if you have a family it will take alot of your time and not very flexible.  They are numbers driven and if you dont meet those numbers you have to stay to try and reach them."
bad,"This company makes promises that they never intend on keeping. Every though you exceed the expectation that they expect, they do not appreciate all the hard work you put in."
bad,"My manager was awesome, but even he felt that no matter how disgusting his male staff left the bathroom, that I shouldn't mind cleaning it. The guys felt that they were more important than any other person, especially the females."
bad,Worked with renter center for a year . . It was the worst but I had to get on my feet so I stayed . But it’s a experience dealing with people & the company will make it seem like it’s your fault if you can’t get unpaid items back from the customers .  It’s not your fault if someone else sold merchandise to bad customers & you can’t retrieve it. . Upper management has to go the extra mile such as taking a life chance at their own lives to get merchandise back . Basically giving a threat back.which I’m not paying a jail bond for a job that you barely get anything for . 330 a week  after taxes & I didn’t have benefits or insurance either. But All you can do is try your best . But once it goes on for a while of you not getting merchandise back . You will have your job threatened. . And write ups will come in. I worked hard for this company doing deliveries . Doing maintenance & installation with items & retrieving merchandise. But when things went bad. The people above your management looks at it different . I had great co works . But the company itself is a no no . Even the co workers don’t like it but they have to deal with it to get through their life. I don’t recommend this company to anyone. .
bad,Took over a failing store. Store had five managers come and go within a two year period. Multiple weeks where I was the only person on staff. Corporate new my store was potentially closing due to another store in close proximity.  Staffing was not provided to succeed. Still managed to achieve top ratings in the amount of AOR loss compared to other stores in the district.
bad,"terrible place to work if you have kids or even if you consider going back to School. Customers more than likely will steal the rented merchandise due to corporates cheap collection process, taking away from certain asset recovery processes due to budget cuts so higher ups can still profit more money"
bad,You will spend a lot of time away from family throughout the day. They expect a lot and pay less. Account Managers almost do it all from sales to deliveries. A lot of physical work.
bad,"Poor management, my store manager would create rules for customers and then bend them, then change them so often, she would go above and beyond for some customers and then not assist others in any way for petty reasons. I hope other store managers are better. Extremely long work hours (usually like 9:30-9:00 everyday), making it very difficult to run errands, see family, have a social life, etc. I wish the bonuses went to all employees instead of just store manager. The pay is decent but not worth it in my opinion."
bad,Management is back and fourth they press a rule then bend it then change it like every other week and be prepared for 50 plus hour weeks every week your home life no longer exists nothing you do is ever good enough and if you finally do something right in their eyes they'll find something else to complain about you never get two days off in a row either always split
bad,Honestly there's not much positive you can say a out RentaCenter; other than they work you so hard that other jobs love to hire a person from RentaCenter. The life/work balance is terrible. The management is mostly horrible. You will work with snakes who only care about their quotas for the week. Sales and Credit constantly clash because of the inherent difference in duties. Asst.Managers have no real power but plenty of responsibilities.
bad,The actual job is great. Company staffing of stores is set up at 4-5 people per store. To get all jobs done properly and maintsin excelleng customer service would need 6-7. 1 person going on vacation can cause a breakdown of production . A store should never be manned by one empliyee for production sake and employee safety sake and it happens very often.
bad,"Over the course of my 10 year mangement career there has been a significant inability to hire or keep good coworkers.  The life balance and the stresses of the job themselves prove to be difficult for most to manage.. In my opion the vision and expectations vs the reality of how that relates to the industry is too far off.  Let alone the wage compensation is not relative to the stressfull physical and mental demands. And the bonus or other incentives are a joke. Throw in having to basically do more than any one individul  should be expected through an extended amount of time and its basically a perfect receipe to drain you physically and mentally.  Not to mention that they are in such desperation to hire staff and pay ""more"" to bring them on even without proper qualifications.  This in turn has chased away good tenured staff that are making dollars less for someone less qualified."
bad,no life work balance at all .. the manager blame you for other people no paying thei bills.. ridiculous hour  mandatory to work on saturdays always short staff
bad,"Spent most of my day cleaning up products in the back to take the the front and sale as if they were ""lightly used.""  Making calls and repossession runs made up the other part of my day."
bad,"Had to hit certain percentages on a daily and then weekly basis for deliveries and credit. If we had hit ours, but other stores hadn't, we would have to stay late to get ours lower so that the district would hit theirs."
bad,"Company expects you to give up your personal life and make sure your store hits the expected “numbers”"
bad,"i learned a lot regarding management and reports sales and achieving goals , it was a great experience yet the schedule was horrible they do not accommodate mothers"
bad,20 + years and let go with no reason given.  Great place to work at one time but last few years don't seam to care about coworkers. Only cared about selling the company.
bad,The company is high stress for little return. Scheduled for 40 hours/week? Plan on working 50+. Customers unwilling to pay their bill or return merchandise? Expect management to blame you and work an extra 4 hours on a Saturday night.
bad,"Good pay horrible hours. It wasnt all bad working here but you rarely can enjoy a day off, and when mentioning suggestions to better the output of your day it gets overlooked."
bad,too many chiefs and not enough workers. Opportunities for women extremely limited. Management knee jerk decisions hurt the company. The culture is so cold.
bad,The company came through a restructure a couple of years ago and things changed. When I first started the management was great they built the trust of team.
bad,"NO WORK/LIFE BALANCE - do not work here if you have children and expect to be home with them enjoying your nights/weekends. You are expected and required to work EVERY SATURDAY. The pay is not nearly enough for what you have to deal with - rude customers, unprofessionalism in some stores, some stores can't even get their work done as needed because they're constantly harrassed with texts from DMs. If you work in sales, you're expected and required to hit your sales standard EVERY WEEK despite if the season is slow or not, and they provide you with little help on how to achieve those goals. Its a huge headache but good for GUYS as far as deliveries and you do get paid every week."
bad,To work at rent a center is high stress and upper management  doesn't have much concern of the well being of their employees. The level of stress to work here is on a daily basis.
bad,Learned how to handle all different kind of customers.  Too much to do in one day not enough employees. Got a lot of expierence in management by one of my great DM at the time. Got a lot of expierence in sales and collections
bad,"Unless you are part-time, which they do not offer anymore, you will be working there everyday for hours and hours on end. Managers get no time off and even on their off days they have to be at the store. The only thing I liked about working there was delivering and running people on my own."
bad,The coworkers weren’t people I thought you should work around and management wasn’t great they are very unorganized and we never got anything done and I felt as tho they blamed everything on the employees and never took responsibility for there actions
bad,RentaCenter has a terrible work/life balance. Rules on standards change almost every other week. They tend to promote people who don't deserve it. There is almost no respect for employees by upper management. Vacations can't be taken when you want them yet they depend on when they say you can take it. Only good things is it's a secure job being that they have a high turn over rate and they get paid weekly.
bad,"The manage was very rude and inconsiderate of personal issues. She made me feel as if I was not smart enough to do my job and put too much stress on me to improve in areas that were not in my job description, nor I was properly trained on"
bad,"Pros:"
bad,"you will be working the floor as a sales employee, then onto the computer to make your calls to pass due customers. make deliveries and make repos too"
bad,ALOT OF HOURS. ALOT OF STRESS AND PRESSURE not entirely worth it. Home office and management are out of touch with the field. Very unrealistic expectations. Company is about to go bankrupt or sell
bad,"The hours are not flexible. You are required to work every weekend. If the collection goals are not met, we are required to stay late nights and run by customers homes. Rent-A-Center teaches its team to practice illegal collections practices. We are required to call a persons reference twice a week even if the reference request for us not to call. An employee who refuses to do such practices or placed on an action plan for termination. The CEO had all employees sign to agree not to do such practices but lower management will terminate you if its not done. The company is very unorganized. The management team is never on the same page."
bad,"Great job if you are single and have no other responsibilities and life and have the workaholic attitude. But if you decide to have a family, not the best place to be"
bad,"Has to sell a certain amount. Have collection at a certain point."
bad,It was great compensation. The culture in this workplace is very specific and anything different was not tolerated. The hardest part was dealing with costumers that were being taken advantage.
bad,"The only real benefit from doing this job, is the opportunity of meeting new and interesting people. Overall pay and benefits were van added bonus. Not much room for advancement."
bad,"Rent a center work hours suck haha but I feel its last resort. A typical day can go from calling customers to running them at home and almost getting beat up trying to get merchandise back that they don't pay for ."
bad,"Really enjoy the workplace between associates and management, very long hours but culture was so outstanding that it actually made the job tolerable. late nights does hamper the real effect of the job"
bad,Company preaches about advancement but at most stores not everyone does their part to help you succeed. Lack of motivation at most stores and only store manager really gets any perks or bonuses.
bad,Managers often would yell at you for following orders if u didn't take your schedualed lung even if you were on the road and could not clock out to take the lunch. Then would adjust your time card to match the hours you are suppose to have. DID NOT LIKE TO PAY OT AT ALL
bad,"High stress daily."
bad,"I started and was told I was going to be making more than what I actually was. My first few days involved me literally sitting doing nothing for 9 hours. After my first week they had finally figured out my video training, which I did for half my day. Once that was completed my other half was just sitting. My third week they told me how to do a couple things one time and then expected me to be on my own. Very poor management when it came to training. The coworkers wrre very sexist and talked degrading about woman.  Customers would call or come in almost daily to complain about how rent a center actually rips them off. Very sad. The main store manager was very nice but definitely needs more training himself in his position. The assistant manager was very lazy and rude."
bad,"This current location here in Chula Vista, CA is one of the worst places to work. Actually all the stores locations in San Diego Area. Im a former employee. Actually a Customer Representative. I had to do all the work with the new management that was changed while I was there. That is why I quite. It really is one of the wort jobs I have worked. Don't be fooled, you have to meet quotas to be able to keep the job, keep that in mind. And their expectations are not possible. Just don't apply here."
bad,"1. Walked in to work, clocked in, asked what was to be loaded then started loading the truck when we were done we would go out and deliver. Come back have lunch go out again if there were more then come back and go home."
bad,"hours are long, schedule changes sometimes without sufficient notice. "
bad,"They have very poor customer service. Their merchandise is weak and cheap. Bad work enviroment. Hours are bad, not trained properly, but want you to scratch nothing at all. Not good management."
bad,"Work long hours, 10-13 a day. Saturdays are always awful, especially if ""credit"" (past due accounts) are out of hand. You are expected to get people with no money to make on time payments every week, if not you are forced to work over, and are threatened with your job.  Once a month, you have to make cold calls to customers who haven't rented in years and try to convince them to come into your store. If you are luck enough to get a manager who understands that sometimes there isn't a lot you can do to manage accounts, then it's not so bad. I hated having to call people 3 times a day and beg for payment."
bad,Management was always threatening everyone to be replaced. telling you your not doing enough. even the managers get threatened with their jobs
bad,"Worked for the company for seven years. Started at the entry level position of Customer Account Representative and worked my way up to Assistant Store Manager. The company has a lack of a training program, they just have you watch videos and expect you to figure the rest out yourself. Management varies from location to location, but most of the upper management LACK professionalism and training as a manager. Management is very hipocritical and only focus on what you can improve on, and NEVER commend you on the things you are doing right. Customer client base is generally aggressive with negative attitudes all day and management will throw their employees under the bus in front of the customer to calm them down, or to make themselves as managers look better.   Working long hours (45-55 hours a week) with only one day off leaves for NO personal time for yourself/family.  Company expects you to live and breath the business and doesn't care about anything else. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND AS A PLACE TO APPLY FOR WORK!"
bad,"Great benefits. That's the good part. No team culture. Rarely promotes within. Tenure does not count for anything. You are wrong, and  management is right. Do not expect any help from upper management, they do not want to get involved. You are on your own, and set up to fail. The longer you are with them, the worse it gets. Micro managing at it's finest !!"
bad,At first it was a great job and great environment. Now all they care about is money money money. Not there employees or how the job needs to be done.
bad,Rent a center is not very professional. I see very little opportunity for advancement. There is very little work life balance.
bad,"Rent a Center has a great training in how to become a manager where you learn collections, A/P, A/R, Human Resources, and a strong back bone in sales. However, it is not a company to stay for long since the long hours, the lack of help from district managers, and the high turnover ratio are the cause that drives people away. You are in retail and you are competing not only with similar stores around your areas, but also with others stores around your district, and if your store does not perform at their expectations (which are  unreasonable) you will not be there for long."
bad,"I learn'd a'lot i did Costumer account rep/Delivery's/Sale's and Collection's."
bad,"Working 50+ Hours"
bad,"Job is alright if you are light on the social ladder.  There is no work/life balance for lower rung employees. Everyday begins at 9 AM, and ends no earlier than 8 PM.  Your vacation weeks for an entire year must be submitted by the first week of January, and you only recieve 2 half day paid PTO days.  If you factor out the forced overtime pay the compensation is on par with every other retailer."
bad,"Hard work, long hours, management demands you get sales if you don't you can get writing up."
bad,"•	Manage 585 accounts."
bad,"*Keeping customers accounts current and gaining them ownership towards items purchased, setting schedules to best fit the stores work load throughout the week."
bad,I worked for the company for almost two years and im gonna be completely honest they only care about the store managers and they will not take anyones word no matter what position you are in they don't give any oppertuntity for the assistants to progress as a m.i.t or anything.
bad,"get in at 8:00 and call delinquent customers and do various jobs for the rest of the day."
bad,"I work hard and see no reward. I love whqat I do but I need to be able to live. i do file verifications and I do Loan processing, i type up Lease Purchase Agreements and I also do legal work and collections. I manage two employees and I aslo train employees for other locations. Im great at what I do I would just like to work somewhere else so I can be great somewhere else."
bad,"Signing Value City Furniture customers to Rent-A-Center lease -to-own program,telemarketing(calling VCF's credit turn-downs,RAC's past quotes),collections(tracking/logging daily,weekly,monthly numbers-sales,credit,Profit+Loss,calling all past due customer's and references)"
bad,"The job was a collection manager, I was told I would be doing sales and phone collections, I would mange certain peoples accounts, upon getting the job I discovered that my job also included deliveries, which I found out very soon that I wasn't physically capable of lifting heavy furniture and appliances. I tryed to focus on all the other aspects of the job and decided that It wasn't fair to the other employees that I culdn't do deliveries so I decided to quit."
bad,10-12 Hour work days.
bad,"There is no work/life balance, this job will consume all your time."
bad,My co-workers were great to work with but the company is not. I was let go due to lack of accounts for the store. One month later they had the accounts back up and were hiring again. Two months after that they let go of the new guy again.
bad,"I like my job ,but I feel as if the company doesn’t appreciate the workers nor does the franchise members communicate well with the daily staff. Not enough pay and I was promised a raise and only received cents after I was promised more to stay with the company and they didn’t hold up their end. I work hard daily to be low balled I’m really upset"
bad,"My mental health was so bad working at this company. The customers are rude and the coworkers are MESSY. You definitely have to harass customers, like it’s literally part of your job. Whether knocking on their door or calling them multiple times a day, it definitely takes a toll on you mentally. Off days are not consecutive so if you have a family or just any errands to run you’ll never feel fully rested ."
bad,"The job had its simple tasks and it’s hard tasks."
bad,Although I can say everything was in order at rent-a-center management is in disarray with some retraining and better communication the workplace could improve but as is needs plenty of improvement
bad,"Long, stressful and exhausting days. No room for advancement and does not compensate fairly according to tasks performed. I do not recommend to anyone looking for a stable career."
bad,"I was a part time delivery specialist, or so they called it. The manager would constantly have us do things that were not in the job description such as answer phones and deal with collections. They micro manage employees and don't pay well at all. It was a decent first job and gave me some experience, but it definitely wasn't for me."
bad,"You make good money, but as a customer account representative, you're put in a position where you're over people's accounts and it's your job to collect payments on time or collect the merchandise. The problem is that you have no back up to do either. You can call a customer a million times or go by their house, even set up a payment arrangement, and if they don't pay or return the merchandise it's all on you and you're held accountable. You can even go to a customer's house and they could be there telling you that you can't retrieve the property and you're not allowed to force your way in or call the cops. I've seen co workers get attacked and the police didn't do nothing. Basically if the customers don't pay, don't give up the merchandise, or moves away without the company's knowledge, then it's your fault and it can cost you your job."
bad,Always under a deadline to meet collection standards. Standards that are completely depend on customers voluntarily surrendering delinquent merchandise or making due payments.
bad,RAC was a good place to get my feet wet. I gained a lot of experience there. Advancement is political and hard to obtain...not impossible though. Business casual dress code when I was there.
bad,"The pay, direct management and personnel at RAC are fantastic.  The working environment was great because I was able to experience many different and new technical systems. However, executive management was poor which led to spontaneous decision-making and poor, if any, planning."
bad,"Excellent tremendous experience at the Rent A center in Bath ME great management and customers."
bad,it was fun working with people and getting a little work out lifting merch always pretty buy but can get very stressful when you have managers that does not know there job duties!
bad,Cool co-workers but poor management. Meeting new people was awesome but had to deal with very nasty people who were either on the edge of overdosing on something or could care less that you are trying to help them fix or set up something they were renting only to be returned in a week.
bad,It is a very challenging job that has it's ups and downs. There are alot of work hours and hardly no family or home time with this job. There are hardly no advancements and hardly no rewards.
bad,Employees are typically stressed due to performance. There have been times when the store manager was willing to lie just to get a sale but it was only because his job was at risk.
bad,"I just couldn't handle selling pre-leased mattress for how much they wanted. The company pays well and the benefits are good, but this is not the job for everyone."
bad,"This company requires Saturdays, is open most major holidays and requires 10 hour days with overtime when deliveries and collections are up.You will have to do drive around doing repossessions for unpaid rentals and make repeated collection calls to references to located stolen and unpaid for merchandise daily. I hope you are physically strong because heavy lifting and stamina is required for the multiple deliveries and repossessions of furniture and appliances."
bad,"Would never go back here. Pay sucks, work sucks. I hated selling things here. I felt like i was ripping people off everyday and had to defend this company when the customer finds out they bought junk and dont wanna pay three times what its worth to own it."
bad,"High stress position with no personal life. I did learn all about multi unit management. Was involved with real-estate, loss prevention, profit and loss, customer service, and much more."
bad,"Great field to enter if you need sales/collections experience.  Provide good training and if you have talent, you can expect to advance within the company."
bad,"RentaCenter has all kinds of nice policies in place about work/life balance and compensation for employees."
bad,"This company pretty much thrives on fooling and taking advantage of poor people and idiots.   It's hard to sell to people who you think are stupid for even considering going with your company.  Expectations change daily.   Telemarketing is a joke, you're required to cold call the same people over and over until they accuse you of harassment.   Prepare to have your life threatened at some point.  Training is awful and doesn't prepare you for the majority of your actual job.   You can tell that anyone who has been there for a year or more is either stressed terribly or just doesn't care."
bad,"Incoming call center from all the RAC retail stores and headquarters.  Troubleshooting a variety of IT issues related to the stores."
bad,"low pay, high stress, no home life"
bad,"My Job at RAC is very fast paced but it is a place of employment that if we are unable to collect funds or our products from customers our job is not secure.  On a daily basis I receive in merchandise, do inventory, take payments, work collections, clean, place orders for items needed for store purposes, and sales.  The place is not very well organized and I am not able to do my job as it is supposed to be completed because the over head is unorganized and goes on a whim instead of following policy.  Communication is the hardest part of my position because no one does this or takes it seriously.  Another hard part is you do not get noticed for all the hard work you put in from 9 to sometimes 9 everyday to make the company successful, all that is done is being put down for what you are unable to complete due to communication.  All and all I can adapt to any job but this one has taken a toll on me and my life with my kids."
bad,Need to try and care more about employees instead of just thinking of them as numbers. Get some security problems fixed.
bad,"Your daily routine focuses around accomplishing your credit goal through either payments or repossession of merchandise, then trying to resell to new or previously returned customers day after day.  Merchandise is in a revolving door, going in and out of different houses many times before someone finally gets to ownership."
bad,This is a great company to work for in the fact that you get to meet new people and help make their lives a little better.  It will pay you a decent amount of money but the politics of the ever changing management requirements of you will always leaving you guessing on what to do next.
bad,This job was not what I had expected per the interviewing process. Vastly disappointed.
bad,Was a company in transition.  My time there was short.  It was a fast paced organization that used their Agency for most things.
bad,The day to day basis of the job is not hard but the problem is the pressure you start receiving when numbers cant be hit. It does feel like a family because you have to work from 47-50 hours per week on a weekly basis. The hardest part is the long hours and the people you deal with. The RTO deals with some people that needs items that are of necessity and they end up not being able to pay and you can't get your items back because they are on government assistance. It is a good stepping stone but not to form a career.
bad,"poor management, and high turn over. As well as high cost for insurance. Limited time to take vacations"
bad,"A typical day at work, is to sign in to your route making collection calls to past due customers. Then driving the company vehicle to clients homes to collect payments and returning merchandise. When arriving back at the store you begin sales and set ups for potentially  new customers and communicate with other RAC stores for different appliances not currently located in our district. I have learned how to manage a route and be accountable for it. I have learned amazing customer service skills and how to communicate with many different types of customers. Co-workers are amazing and very fun and educational to work with always ready to help out and get the job done. The hardest part of the job would be the physical lifting of the  appliances and working with the many different customers on a daily basis. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing a customer happy with our product and making my numbers for the week for the incentive bonus included with pay."
bad,My responsibilities as the Security Specialist III were to find and secure all elements of the PayDay Loan side of Rent-A-Center. This includes securing financial information for customers as well as securing all connections to multiple financial institutions over various WAN connections.  Additional responsibilities included SOX and PCI compliance on a quarterly base. Worked with 3rd party providers to insure all financial information was secure. Many goals accomplished on a daily bases using my security experience with various tools and knowledge of networking.
bad,Typical days including overcoming customer complaints and maintaining a good customer relationship. Management swayed with the wind it seemed. Local management was good but corporate seemed to go against their own training regimen. Co-Workers were the saving grace of the job as each store was a tight nit group of 4-6 people and you became close. The hardest part of the job was the feeling of never being able to do enough to please upper management. The most enjoyable part of the job was the benefits and weekly pay.
bad,"You WILL work 48-50+ hours per week depending on whether management or not. You are not compensated fairly, and if you perform deliveries you will encounter questionable environments that can/will be hazardous to ones health. Clientele does not monitor their health and germs run rampant in the store and at customers homes."
bad,"I WALKED OUT ON THE COMPANY. the manager I had no idea what he was doing nor did he want to hear that he was wrong. 9 out of 10 customers threatened you. this could be a very fun job but with the managager at the location I was at it made life miserable. he had no idea how to listen to a coworker to address a problem. his way was THE WAY. ""challenge"" that and he lost his marbles. The company as a doesnt care about its workers. your schedule revolves around them. dont plan on doing anything after work."
bad,No life hrs to long and corptate don't give a hoot about employee
bad,it is a fine place to start
bad,"Lousy management, impossible goals, no life outside of work."
bad,"A company that many will work for and few can succeed. Good numbers Monday, but bad numbers wednesday and ""you're fired"". Jobs are constantly threatened, work a lot of hours not for a family man or woman. Great pay and potential for advancement, good benefits."
bad,"Though the company is in the buisness of ""helping"" people they can easily put thier customers into a hard situation. Worked hard for them would not do it again."
bad,"I worked over 16 years with Rentacenter - missed many family events and milestones. When you did get time off, you were made to feel guilty or shamed."
bad,"Every day is a grind, and it sometimes seems like you are just spinning your wheels. You have to sell to bad paying customers, and then get scolded when they don't pay. Management doesn't really seem to know its customers, and everything we would sell is super expensive."
bad,Rent A Center is an okay company to work for. the have great benefits. the managemant and corporate are horribe. its stressful and the company only act like they care about you
bad,Honestly at first it wasn’t bad. But the pay is horrible for everything that you do. I was there for almost 3 years and yet the hired new people with no experience at a higher wage.. rent a center gives zero f*cks about you. All they care about is money. It’s a job for a kid out of highschool. Not worth trying to build a career. I don’t recommend working here unless you’re desperate for money
bad,Management cares more about money than the safety and well being of employees. When you address an issue nothing changes. Company policy seems to be left up to the district manager I guess there is no such thing.
bad,Fun place to work meet a lot of interesting people it's an uphill battle to advance from employee to store manager some customers are not that honest but it still an okay place to learn more about the business world
bad,Good environment with some nice people. Only thing is from district management and above they don't seem to care about normal employees much. They will also look to take advantage if you let them.
bad,I enjoyed sales and collections and hated upper management demanding overtime and using your job as incentive to keep you in the store. Saying no was not an option when it came to overtime at this store.
bad,"This company has been run into the ground and is being sold off and split up. My entire branch, about 20 locations with over a hundred employees at each just lost their jobs"
bad,It’s a ok environment the customers are in good mood and entertaining the co workers as well everyone gets done what they need to and pull there weight
bad,Pay is great for all positions even entry level. Bad part of the job is trying to repo furniture and stuff from customers. Normal week is 48 hours so overtime pay is good. Upper management is not helpful.
bad,Company is failing because of its unethical practices and poor management. Hire the right people and stop filling positions with random people. Was a fun job but its failing ways made it stressful
bad,Expect to do a lot of heavy lifting and repossessions. Lots of sales and also building new furniture in customer home and lots of driving and collecting payments on the road.
bad,"Hardworking environment, gained a lot of managerial experience,store managers are fine until their district manager stresses them about numbers then you have to sell 10 items a day which most time is not beneficial to the customer, hardest part of the job unhappy customers,"
bad,"Working at Rent A Center i learned you have to move quickly when it comes to the process of sales, going over rental agreements, collection calls and deliveries and pick ups. so all around when working there you have to be very structured, specific,and fast."
bad,"Management was not organized, schedule changed last minute often. What I did enjoy about working with Rent a center was the friendly customers, discounts and the hours each week gave me time to my family. I would often drive anywhere from 30-100 miles a day. The hardest part of the job would be bringing furniture such as washers and dryers, couches and refrigerators up and or down stairs."
bad,They're getting rid of people because the company is going down.Don't waste your time. At the corporate HQ's they're outsourcing for their call center jobs.
bad,its a okay job would be nice if they paid a little more or offered over time i like my manger and coworkers and i am thankful for the job opportunity.
bad,"At this job you have make sales, collect money, collect calls. Make deliveries, fix the backroom and the showroom. If people don't pay, you go to there house to pick up the item or get a paymeny"
bad,I would work 8-10 hours a day and did everything from assembling our products to going to peoples houses and calling people to have them come into the store to make payments. Management was probably the hardest to deal with sometimes along with the regular aggravated customer. But it was fun. Paid every Friday and got to drive a lot. I loved making a customers day and being able to work with some of the newest products on the market.
bad,Company has a lot of customer interactions environment with  supportive management. Has a lot of goals and expectations  that needs to be meet. This company develops and promote within.
bad,"sales, inventory, arranging show room, telemarketing and mailing flyers out. district manager would give extremely unreasonable sales expectations in a day"
bad,"Customer interactions, collections, sales calls, face-to-face customer counseling as well as over the phone. "
bad,Job would be ok if the hours were better and the management followed their own rules. Sales are made at any cost. High risk customers that have defaulted before are rented to when sales goals are short. Decent customers that miss a payment are punished with unjust pick ups when past due numbers are high. Customers can be angry and violent and are usually in bad neighborhoods.
bad,Long days at Rent a Center. Its tough dealing with collections on a daily basis. I enjoy making sale as well as interacting with customers everyday.
bad,"great money, but not worth the stress on you mentally and physically... upper management does not care about employees.  your job security is based on whether customers pay you on time. never get your during the week day off as a store manager.  always demand more and is never satisfied... co workers become like a family environment but hardest part of the job is maintaining work.life balance"
bad,Job posting should read.   Are you tired of seeing your kids and wife?  do you wanna work long shifts with no reward and still not accomplish a thing?    do you want to deal with upset people daily and pester them to pay?    do you never want a weekend off unless there is a tragedy?    come work for RAC
bad,"The typical day at work would consist of making collection calls in the morning(2hrs), followed by deliveries and returns in the afternoon(4-6hrs), and ending the day with more collection calls and inventory management at the end of your day. The management can vary between amazing to down right awful, i have experiences the more pleasurable of the management, but i would not expect all of district managers to back you up in any company disputes(even if you are blamed for something out of your control). The co-workers are mostly friendly, but usually not the most intelligent, this makes it so the management treats all Customer Account Representatives as though they have had marginal education. The hardest part of the job is collections, BE PREPARED TO BE VERBALLY ABUSED ON A DAILY BASIS. "
bad,A typical work day started at 8 am and did not end until well after 9 pm for me. I learned that Higher Management will do whatever it takes in Rent A Center to make themselves look good even if it costs some one else their job. Some coworkers were great to work with but there were others that were back stabbers and would tell not only the upper management but other coworkers stuff that were not true. I loved working for my customers but I never had anytime with my Family and missed out on a lot of my kids lives the 5 years I was there. Most of my customers made my job enjoyable cause I knew about their lives and special things in them.
bad,"A typical day at rent a center was to complete daily operations. For me my job duties consist of ensuring sales floor remained clean and properly displayed at all times, developing new market strategies' and advertisements."
bad,Management enjoyed working with the public employees were very hard working and for the most part honest
bad,Long hours but advancement options great pay good place to work.
bad,I had experience when I went to this job. It was an excellent work environment. My supervisor was witty and fun to work with.
bad,"Rent A Center claims to be trying to improve the lives of their co-workers and their customers, but fail in regards to both, You work 50 hours a week to constantly be micro managed for performance of unattainable goals. You work all day every single day 9-8. No time for a personal life or to get anything done outside of work. Our customers don't fair much better. We over charge for almost all of our products (cash prices on furniture are at least close to a store cost) and constantly overload them because we ""need to get a deal out!"" They end up not being able to afford and then we have to take their merchandise back. How would you feel if you put upwards of $2200 into a 2 year old television and were forced to return it? It's ridiculous and cruel to be honest. I worked my way up to Store Manager level where I remained for almost 2 years until the ridiculous company expectations and district manager expectations finally took their toll. Numbers weren't even bad in my store and I loved my crew, but the day to day struggle becomes very tedious."
bad,"Company sucks. Moderate pay, horrible hours. Horrible time off system. Horrible raise structure. Company over promises and never delivers on anything. It wouldn’t matter if they didn’t promise, and incentivize things. But since they do, they should fulfill their promise of reward, which never happens. And the job itself sucks. Overcharging for most products, and dealing with scummy people."
bad,They should show the employees more appreciation and look more into what managers are doing with there business maybe they will keep more employees around
bad,Hours are not great and no chance for advacment. Pay could be better no over time. And pretty good benifets. Some things can be a lil better and need better hours
bad,"There management has a problem with how they handle employees, big turn over rate. If the company invested in reviewing their prospective SM, DM, RD.."
bad,Job was not hard if you’re able to lift things. Get to be on the road and see things you may not seen before by traveling to different areas where customers may live .
bad,"On the good days working there is fun, always busy lots of things to do and you get to meet lots of new and interesting people. This company is base on renting to own to customers with bad credit or no credit. The more sales they want the more management encourages you to sell to people who are overloaded with merchandise which make it harder for them to pay. On the other side this is a company that will punish you by making you would late and Saturday nights if you don’t get customers to pay on their past due rent like it’s your fault that bad paying customers don’t want to pay on time."
bad,The people where fun to work with well some of them. The expectations of the company are unrealistic. For a credit manager they expect you to have 6 sales while closing your credit. Also is hard to close credit when your always making deliveries and not able to do the job. Job turnover is high and expect to deal with angry customers over payments. Also dont expect to be home much alot of overtime and is expected to that time in order to meet goals.
bad,"Usually all the work was on a time limit, which increased stress for employees and customers. Customers were great for set up of furniture, but usually turned into problems later down the road"
bad,"Rent-a-center was horrible, the pay for the amount of work you do is less than stellar, and the hours were insane! No overtime was allowed, DIRECT MANAGEMENT was not the issue, But when it was above the manager, is where the problem comes from"
bad,I loved the people I worked with but the management sucked.  Management was slow about doing what needed done and would not listen to the employees.  Did not like it there
bad,Loved working there until there was a change in CEO's then it was all down hill. Turnover is outrageous and not enough tools for training new employees. You could be the best employee but you will only be allowed to grow as much as they want you to grow both matter the how much potential you have.
bad,"I could not get out of there fast enough. Unfortunately, some potential employers frown upon candidates who leave jobs ""too soon,"" so I stuck it out for 18 months until I sensed more looming job cuts. My timing was perfect."
bad,This company helped me realized my potential to be a great manager because it forced you to be because of the stress and the fast pace. You'll learn a lot because you will learn that the customer base does not tolerate mistakes and do not promise what you can not deliver. Very stressful and you have no work life balance not for a family man.
bad,"The work outweighs the pay. Benefits are great but job security is not. Other drivers can call the hotline to complain about a driver and once they get 3 complaints, RAC cut all ties! It’s a week to week business. Meaning you can be the best this week and be the worst next week. You can be patted on the back at one moment and be criticized the very next! Everyone in the company walks on pins and needles."
bad,"There is no process whatsoever.  Most people who have worked here for more than a year came up through RentaCenter either from the field or customer service and have no idea how to do their current positions hired for.  If you kiss behind, you can move up fast.  There is no working from home.  Favoritism is shown for people who have been here longer.  A lot of backbiting as well."
bad,"Good pay, good benefits, but the job takes a toll on your mind.  You have to go in and be a jerk everyday in order to do your job right.  The district manager was terrible as well."
bad,A typical work day at Rent A Center is fast paced and stressful.  The company is a customer based company but lately it has been a numbers based company.
bad,"open store call past-due accounts review p&l daily set schedule for deliveries sale on floor collect in field,train and hire new employees,banking, as long as your numbers were where they are good your good but if you go south they forget what you have done and are quick to over correct very stress-full super high accountability"
bad,"If you like fast paced environments / manual labor, then this is a pretty good job for you. It has its ups and downs and isnt my cup of tea but not too bad. Pay and benefits are really great"
bad,"Long work hours we work through 3 shifts morning afternoon and night, no work life balance. OK insurance and time off but their is really no training in you aspire to move up past assistant manager. once you earn vacation they do everything in their power to discourage their employees from taking their vacation."
bad,"The RAC experience is a Lifestyle Choice.  You have to be willing to work long hours; holidays, weekends.  You have to be business minded.  You are repossessing furniture and electronics from older folks and families with kids.  This business prays on the impulsive buyers, charging them 3 times the cost of the good over time.  Good workplace if you like making calls to ask for payments. You ride around knocking on the delinquent's doors in some rough areas. You learn time management and if you are in the top 5 % you normally go on and all expense paid week long trip (Puerto Rico, Hawaii)"
bad,"I have stayed with this company for almost 3 years and it is an all consuming job. This job does have places for advancement, but the added stress does not seem to be worth the pay."
bad,Rent-A-Center is good for the employees but horrible for the customers. Each location is established in underprivileged communities and profits off of families and individuals who are barely getting by with additional government assistance for food and utilities.
bad,Rent-A-Center was a great company. My hours were consistent and the flexibility was great. I liked working for the company but I feel I was wrongfully terminated due to an issue that was not my fault
bad,"The job can have its ups and downs, but if you do not kiss up to the District Manager in 442, then you are quickly put on the ""naughty"" list. I would not recommend for anyone to work for this company due to all the empty promises that they tell you. It is more important for you to be at work instead of taking your children to the doctor, or even if you are vomiting blood on the sales floor. The district manager will tell you, ""it is ok,"" or ""you planned for this to happen"" or ""if you go home then that is your job."" The district manager does not take s. harassment claims serious either."
bad,"I have worked at this company for over a decade. I moved from a  full-time, starter position as an Account Manager (now Customer Service Rep) to Store Manager. The hours are long but the pay is good at the expense of a life outside the job. (50-60 our weeks are standard for management and 40-hour weeks for other full time staff."
bad,Open store and set up displays. Assist customers with product knowledge and rental options. Cold call for sales. Assist with deliveries and pick ups at scheduled times.
bad,"Not worth it. The co-workers were cool, but management was unorganized. Not to mention when they send you out on deliveries, you're by yourself most of the time picking up heavy items, and when you take too long to come back they get on you about it. Maybe if I had help I'd get the job done faster. Sorry but I'm not going to risk my health just so the managers won't get in trouble."
bad,I would move couches and help costumers pay their bills. Also try to sell them items that they needed and wanted
bad,Running credit managing store and delivering. My coworkers are good people. Hardest part is holdin your tongue while u get cussed out on a daily basis by customers for doing your job. The best part is looking forward to your days off. The job is stressfull and u have to be strong more mentaly then physically to handle it.
bad,"Dificil de trabajar con ellos, no tienes apoyo de los mandos"
bad,"Loved rent a center, easy environment to work in. We help customers with any complaints that they might have. We do our best to get ahold of people in the field."
bad,"Not a bad job, can be stressful at times but I enjoy the challenge everyday."
bad,Day to day customer service. Long hrs to achieve percentage goals. Enjoyed being out of store in the field helping customers.
bad,the company will push you to your limits. if your looking to live where you work and go home long enough to sleep..this is the job for you!
bad,"Rent-A-Center provides low income customers with the ability to rent to own furniture, and electronics. Their business practices do not align with my personal code of ethics."
bad,Working for Rent A Center will provide you with the opportunity to prove your sales capabilities while learning the beginning process of collection activity. The challenge about the position you will have is earning the trust of your customers as the requirements can be very demanding. Each day will have the same structure with very different results. The hardest part of the job is repossessing the property from customers that is no longer able to afford the product.
bad,"Great opportunity and advancement, but as a Store Manager, they tend to add more responsibility on a daily basis and expect you to work 70+ hours on a weekly basis."
bad,Good company can be frustrating with past due calls and pressure from higher ups. I enjoyed the nature of the work and the people I worked with. Pay was about $9 to $11 after a year and a half. But working late hours and weekends take its toll on you.
bad,You will hardly see your family if you have one. Great job for a single person. Dealing with difficult people on a daily basis was hard to get use to but you will get use to it.
bad,Hectic moving furniture for a woman already but I’m a tomboy so it wasn’t that bad for me. Women who don’t “get dirty” won’t last. Good pay but the hours can suck sometimes. Never off on Saturdays and hard to take off since there are only about 5 workers per store. A year here was long enough for me. Great coworkers but I didn’t have proper management to succeed. Maybe at a different location.
bad,"Pay was good benefits were great, but due to the customers rudeness made job miserable and long hours there was little time for family. Coworkers were very accepting but upper management was about numbers only and didn’t matter what it took to get them"
bad,The place was very good but kind of environment not very friendly to work ...no flexibility of work from home either.  Got good exposure to working with different teams on different projects.
bad,"always had to achieve your goals very hard on customers upper mangement did not care only wanted results did not work with customers "
bad,"Good starting job with great exposure to all types of customers and aspects of business operations. Good pay and many hours available, but as a career the constant hassle from upper management and customers, the days pass with unnecessary stress."
bad,"10-12 hours per day, expectations are the same everywhere, does not matter if in a small market or large market. The expectations are to be as productive as a large market area.  Late nights started becoming the normal."
bad,I Take and  make calls I do money transactions  and bank I also file and  process paperwork answer the phone and take messages and make sales calls...
bad,"it was ok  you get paid every week, I loved the people I worked with and loved being able to be around the city and not just in a office I wish I was currently still employed"
bad,"Operated service vehicle to gain collections."
bad,"Busy, basically  need to fix MANAGEMENT then it would give the place a better feel for customers and employees"
bad,"El puesto de chofer no es tal , eres el moso de todos , tus compañeros te exigen q hagas actividades que les tocan a ellos , el gerente se la pasa viendo series en el celular y siempre anda de mal genio . "
bad,"A typical day would start at 9am and end at 8pm. Productivity was a must. Every day there was the push to perform to outdo and be better than before."
bad,"Unethical place to  work.... Management tries to make you not follow policy, job stability is threatened if your not cooperating with not following policy, moral is low amongst employees, management will call you at home if you call in sick to try and scare you into coming in"
bad,I have forgotten more about Rent A Center than I can put here. Being in Management was very very stressful but the pay and benefits were great.
bad,They expect twice the work for minimum wage. Would not recommend employment is through GOODWILL which they take out a cut of your pay as well and you make next to nothing.
bad,"Coworkers are fantastic, pay is wonderful for the area, job is only as hard as you make it. However, you are asked to do one thing and then in the next sentence, asked why you did that and told to do the exact opposite. The upper management tends to talk out of both sides of their mouths. Running both sides of the business (sales and credit) isn't a difficult task but the way they want you to do it and the contradictory ways they tell you to do it makes it difficult to be certain that you're doing the right thing. They get upset about the least small thing and feel that their employees are expendable. The time requirements do not allow much time at home, especially for the managers. They are not very willing to work with the managers to give them the opportunity/perk of being the manager and being able to take advantage of salary pay by being able to be home at an earlier time. Instead, managers are expected to stay there from before open to after close every day and a lot of times on their supposed day off. The benefits are great and the employee purchase/discounts are awesome. It's just difficult to be happy with the rest."
bad,co worker were awesome fun to work with flexible hours and schedule.. hardest part was the heavy lifting sometimes lone.. in the cold
bad,Typical day was ve hard work sales and he customers decide on what they really want.
bad,"This a Company you have to be very versatile with. Anything from collections, sales, repair, refurbishment, people friendly."
bad,Tons of overtime but a lot of problems as well. Upper management are not very professional at all.
bad,Dealing with this customer base of people was very different. This job taught me how to deal with highly stressful situations especially when people are having bad financial situations as well there on personal problems. Some of the co-workers were easy to deal with but others were not.
bad,A typical day at work would to be make our daily calls and head out to our past due customers houses to collect. What I learned is that we have to be sympathetic and empathetic. Management I would say wasn't very professional for a very successful company. The hardest part of the job would be to stay past the hours we were scheduled too. Meaning Over Overtime. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people and helping them with their needs and answers to their questions as their Customer Account Rep.
bad,"A typical day consisted of coming in early, calling past due and currents accounts. I learned how to work in many different situations with customers, how to keep accurate and detailed notes for legal use, and the ability to meet weekly credit close percentages. The management was good and had a lot of difficult situations thrown at them from a merge in companies. Co-workers were for the most part informative of credit management. The most difficult aspect of the job however, was being in situations that were far from sanitary and households with infestations of various bugs and insects."
bad,"Helping people obtain a lifestyle overnight.  Sales, collection, and customer relations were all utilized."
bad,the job has great pay and benefits but i was only hired temporary. they demand so much out of you that it isnt funny 
bad,"long hours and no so good pay, manager was vary hard to work with, not able to every move up."
bad,"Be prepared to work 48 hours a week...on the ugliest shift there...9-7:30 pm. It's not fun...and when your numbers are ""down"" you are frowned upon."
bad,"Collecting bunk-beds from kids on Christmas Eve, management that assures you that you have no long term future with the company on a daily basis."
bad,"You work collections essentially. Deal with angry customers in setting up and getting money for overpriced goods. Your a name and a number on the collections reports and they could care less whether you actually are doing your job or not you will never be a long term employee unless you reach district manager. Seriously everyone who worked at our store was gone within a few months of each other including the manager, even though profits and collections were up."
bad,Over all I really like my immediate supervisor and co-workers. But this company had a lot of manage and executive turnover the one and a half year I worked there. We were always worried about our job being cut which eventually happened. the rest of IT will be outsourced. This is not a Stable company to work for.
bad,"The job/work life balance working for rentacenter is not for someone who has family, Monday thru Friday 9am-7:30pm an Saturdays 8:30am-6pm"
bad,"(Management) communicate with all staff in a timely manner train better things would flow, work is rushed customers most enjoyable"
bad,Just wasn't for me any more I was tired of being put in front of harms way picking up angry customers merchandise. in all different bad areas.
bad,"Set a plan for team to do that day, follow up on what was done the day before. do daily budget, make collection calls, follow up on what everyone is doing that day, organize front back of the store, sales calls, process payments, do money drops, do bank deposits, check customer files and records, customer service"
bad,"My position is mostly based on generating business for the company "
bad,Notthe place for me. Maybe a different manager and I'd still be there.
bad,this job was only good because i got to ride around all day and not get fired but on slow days it was so boring it was bitter sweet like u get to know whats on sale and get it before everyone
bad,"Get to work and run reports, turn everything on, check out our schedule to see what needs to be done.  Once everybody gets there we are all lined out for certain jobs weather it be cold calling, deliveries, sales, cleaning the store.  I basically cold called 100 people a day, checked up on previous leads, ordered any furniture or supplies needed, made sure files were correct before filing them, closed the store between 7-730pm."
bad,when i first started working at rent a center is was very fun and customer friendly but over the yers it became more about the money
bad,Rent a center is a tough company to work for. It is physically demanding and you will spend a lot of time after hours of close of business. Customers are treated with respect but otherwise looked at like dollar signs. I refer to the sales of rent a center more like a car lot. They require you to be pushy and try to give more product to the customer than what they can financially afford just to have more items on their books. This in turn puts more pressure on their account managers to get the customer to pay for a product they cannot afford just to eventually have to go pick the product back up from the customer. It wastes more time in the long run than actually helps the company. Management trains the employee one time and then sets them out to figure out the rest of what they need to do on their own. in the end the employee usually gets frustrated for getting yelled at for not doing a job correctly that they otherwise were never trained on.In my experience the area supervisor was more focused on his own career rather than trying to help each store individually with what they needed help and focus on. the most enjoyable part of the job was delivering the merchandise to the customers. they were always very happy and usually tried to tip but we would always turn it down.
bad,"There is always something to do, never a not busy work day. I learned how to make up agreements for merchandise, I also learned how to move furniture the correct way."
bad,"You can easily get a years worth of working out at the gym in just one summer working at Rent-A-Center. Lifting, pulling, pushing, carrying, and all manner of physical activity in delivering products to customers will be very challenging but rewarding if you can get your body in tune."
bad,Working at rent a center as a assistant manger kept me away from my life and family. I worked so hard and so many hours and it is something I'm not used it. Maybe this job wasn't meant for me. I always felt stressed and I needed a break. It was a real pressure for me.
bad,"Management was great. People in store were awesome as well, but the customers were the worst part of the job. Welfare queens sitting at home doing nothing will call you in to attempt to get free stuff. Corporate always pushes down very high goals, but does not compensate people for it."
bad,"For the most part, good place to work. Coworkers are productive. The only negative thing I would say is working 12 hours a day until 8:30 or 9pm every night. Other than that, not a bad place to work."
bad,the work was good hours where great but the promote from with in does not exist it is not even recommended to ask when there is and obvious position available.
bad,"	Load/unload truck, or other vehicle, per policy to safely protect coworker and merchandise"
bad,"work 47 to 50 hours a week"
good,"Although Convenient with the location being relatively close to my home,the atmosphere of the company was despicable. The management was very poor.  The company was understaffed all the time. I was overworked and under paid. There were times where I had to do deliveries on my which involved delivering furniture and carrying such items alone. They even told me as part of my interview that I would not be responsible for carrying or delivering furniture yet I was and they never gave me the help. If you want to be treated with respect and have some dignity I suggest you work elsewhere"
good,Use to have competitive pay has fallen behind now with growing economy. Long hours only off Sundays very bad work life balance. Brutal work load low compensation very stressful corporate don't care about. Employees
good,A typical day at work is being very busy. I learned how to listen to my clientele. The hardest part of the job is to hear of sad situations that people get themselves into. Getting to know my clientele by listening to them talk about their lives.
good,You work very long hours with little pay. very strenuos with lifting. do not care about employees if hurt on job. Not allowed very much time off. Not a family friendly company for employees
good,"Rent-a-center is only a good job if your manager likes you. If you miss your end of the week 5.9 collection rate, then the decison to fire you or keep you is his or her decision, so if you like wearimg knee pads, then this is the job for you."
good,"I was the only woman in the store for a while working her , at least for the first 8 months, felt targeted as a woman working there, I can in as assistant manager , some where jealous because I had to experience in management and they felt i was only hired due to my appearance.  I tried switching stores but my manager became bothered by that and soon i noticed a change in the work environment and unfair treatment."
good,Unorganized company that causes anxiety if wales aren’t made. Management needs work. Started off as a temp and then hired on permanently. Okay place to work
good,"It is a good job if you have no life. Unrealistic expectations, and no advancement opportunities unless you know somebody. If you do your job correctly that is as far as you will go."
good,"No work life balance, mission statement is preached but never followed, success is determined by daily actions and not the long term affect of those actions"
good,"Working at rent a center i got a lot of experience in sales, collections and management, been working for rent a center for 4 years now, started off as a CAR and now assistant manager. but its time for me to move on to better things."
good,"Not much to say, wasted years here just to be lied to the entire time,"
good,The job is very time consuming but at times they do not appreciate your work. As well they do not help you so much with your schedule. As well you should not push your self to the impossible because they will not be greatful.
good,"Store manager refuses to hire employees that do not fit their own personal desires. Numerous candidates were overlooked everyday based upon race, gender, age and nationality. Coworkers were forced to work 10+ hour days while store manager would leave in the middle of the day for personal reasons. Very unprofessional work environment. This would not be a location that I would recommend anyone to work at. All in all a good company, but they need to make serious changes to management to improve this location."
good,"Rent-A-Center helped me learn some more customer service skills as well as receptionist skills. The start off pay for someone with no experience was good, but getting a raise and advancing in the company was nearly impossible."
good,"Speak to an ex-employee before you decide to work at any location, you will work at best every Saturday and they are talking about taking most holiday's away.  Not to mention you will fear for your job from the time you finish training, or lack there of."
good,"A typical day with this company consisted of loading up living room sets, bedroom sets, kitchen sets, washers and dryers ect into a truck or van and delivering it to the customer. on occasions i would get product that has not yet been put together so i would put it together at the store then deliver it to the customer."
good,"The pay is okay but its not worth all the people you have to deal with. Being cussed out and door slammed in your face, Management usually sucks and only cared about the goal and not the people."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was the ability to be able to help people. Help employees grow within the company and help customers get the things they wanted. The hardest part of the job was having an immediate supervisor that did not care about training you and the well-being of your job.
good,"Its was a good job to work for but if you don't put your life on hold you will never get anywhere."
good,"This is a very demanding work environment where you are expected to work 10-12 hr shifts and you only get 1 day off at a time. Never 2 days in a row and you work EVERY saturday. The goals set by the upper management are outragous and never seem to be attainable. The plus side is you are getting paid overtime every week, but you dont have time to spend the money as you are at work all the time. You are required to purchase your own RAC branded clothes which are expensive but you are given the option to purchase retail items at cost."
good,If you need to know something beyond the week of training they hand you- you need to learn how to do some research on their network and find the standard operating procedure do to it around because everyone is going to have their own opinion and own way that they've always done things and never been told differently.
good,I did not enjoy my job at rent a center because daily I was exposed to living conditions that I was uncomfortable being in considering I had to repossess equipment and merchandise from behind customers.
good,always rushed and never get any acknowledgement for work when completed.
good,If you would ever like to have a life outside of work this job is not good for you. The pay is alright but your working 48-50 hours a week and every Saturday. 
good,Very unprofessional lack respect for employees and work is dangerous they don’t follow protocol. I felt like I was being over worked with no help. I felt harassed by boss .
good,"It was a very stressful position with the inadequate employees, lack there of.  Not only did you have to do your job, you had to do others also. If hired for a position in management, be careful, anyone associated with the higher up position will strip you of your position so that they can pass that to the higher up ""friend."" The hardest part was not having the correct people in place, one says something, the other says another and you want to just pull your hair out because you are doomed if you act on either."
good,"This company does a lot behind the scenes and does not let employees know until too late, then they don't have any answers for them.  It used to be about the quality of life for their coworkers and customers and now it all about profit"
good,"The good thing about it is if your sales culture is right, it can be enjoyable despite what the actual job details are is; the reason is that when workers are excited, customers are excited and the picture of success comes full circle, right? Everyone wins."
good,Would recommend if you are a single person enjoyed the traveling enjoyed the the customers enjoyed the discounts employee's where able to make purchases that we could never be able to purchase loved and enjoyed helping people and putting smiles on there faces
good,loved my store and employees but higher up employees really need to be changed it’s a great job just high rotation of employees and a lot of demand with little recognition.
good,Better management could produce a more positive and stress free environment. Turn over rate would go down with more concern for employees throughout the business. If employees have more support from heay lifting to a better process of running a store.
good,"I would not recommend this job to anyone, ever. Coworker were force to work dangerous conditions and schedules were constanly changed without regards to employees prior commitment s."
good,"I think it more depends on your Manager and coworkers. The store I worked at showed blatant favoritism from the Manager. "
good,"Boss and coworkers were not outgoing/ and did not have leadership, boss was very stress out and there was no advancement in Nashville rent a center, my coworkers were not fair to the customers"
good,"Money is good but your life is theirs, long hours and not much room for advancement.  Management doesn't much care for your well being just if you can preform and be into work on time."
good,This a great company to work but you have no backing as far as management. You work long hours with no benefits. Its impossible to get done what needs to done without a willing team and store manager all working as a team.
good,Working at Rent A Center was a real experience. Long days and sometimes long nights. Furniture to clean and set up the showroom took hours. Team work was needed always. Working 6 days out of 7 days was the tough. Quotes needed to be met and you must stay until they were!
good,"Good co-workers.  Poor management."
good,"come in have meeting about weekly goals, learned account details with company, managerment are kind ok but could be more professnal, my co-workers are ok i spend the entire day with them,hardest part is picking to load up from lazy co-workers,cool part would be the pizza days"
good,this companmy overworked me with 14+ hrs a day. Had to complerte many tasks on my own time and not get paid for it. I was doing great working there then i walked in and told my position was filled and they let me go. no reason behind it. they were all about drinking afer work and I wasnt. I wanted to be home with my famliy. I was never able to pack a lunch because the trucks didnt have AC and i had to eat at fast foods if i had the time.
good,"They do not pay enough for the work they want you to do and the hours they want you to work.  You will never know what time you will be getting off.  Management only cars about them selves and if they cannot find a reason to fire you they will demote you and take your pay down.  They promise you bonuses but the change the bonus structure so often, that the only people who will get bonuses is the General Manager and not store managers. The general managers will promise assistants store manager positions and basically turn the assistants against their managers when they don't have any intentions on promoting them."
good,called about 100 people a day to get the m to pay their accounts and ran the credit for people we couldn't reach on the phone. did the pickups and deliveries. refurbished products and had to get sales
good,"The overall job was ok but the work life balance was horrible. I found out even as you progressed in your career corporate office wanted more. Compensation was good if you were a store manager with a profit margin of atleast 20+ percent, but if you're a C.A.R. you needed another job after you got off work. Job security was sometimey. Some times you were 100% comfortable with not having to worry about losing your job but other times you weren't. Advancement was completely based on metrics and that was fine with me because earning your keep is way better than tenure to me. Management was ok as long as they weren't having a bad day. The only thing I didn't like was that one incident can ruin all the good you may have done for the organization and it all was dependent on how they felt that day. The best part of the job was the customers. When you see a customer month after month you tend to for a genuine relationship with them not on a personal level but on a level of understanding which works well with you when dealing with the public."
good,"A typical day includes calling past due customers, contacting sale leads, going over daily agenda, lunch break, delivery, servicing, and pick-ups, running past-due customers, come back to the store, replacing merchandise on showroom floor, calling past-due customers again, making sure the floor is ""rent ready"". I have acquired many skills from this opportunity such as; telemarketing, became a competent salesman, excellent time management, electronic and appliance specialist, and how to troubleshoot. The management did what was required by corporate but when it came to customer worker conflict was not up to par. The co-workers were great and easy to work with. The hardest part of the job was probably the managements' expectations of a single worker doing the job of two. The most enjoyable part was training new employees and making deliveries."
good,its a descent job if you dont have family. Great benefits and descent pay but the management and scheduling is not organized.
good,"A Typical day at Rac for an Asst.Mgr./Sales Mgr. Is very stressful not only dose the person have to make sure everything that is being delivered that day is going out on time but the merchandise is in the store. The sales Mgr. coordinates everything from the time that deliveries get taking to the customers and information being verified  on their applications. It's up to the sales Mgr. to have the sales floor staged with pricing and promotions.In that position you receive consistent pressure from upper management to reach sales goals because the Sales Mgr. is the only one expected to make sales out of a small staff of five.These things are the reason your job is always in jeopardy and you are constantly reminded of that. when in all actuality if it wasn't for the sales Mgr. no one would have job because it's up to the Sales Mgr. to  establish a rapport with the customers, that makes every ones else's position relevant. The hardest part of the job is long hours and split off days (50hrs.wk.)"
good,No work life balamce.  YOu work so many hours if you have a family you will never see them. The pay does not justify the time it takes out of your life to work at RAC.
good,"long hours and hard work, not a good job for people with morals"
good,Originally when I started with the company I enjoyed working here very much.  When I was promoted to SM things slowly started to change for the worse.  Aside from being talked down to on frequent occasions upper management thrive off of threatening employment to attempt to get employees motivated
good,"Enjoy all my customers and have achieved alot of the tasks. I have a pretty new crew which alot falls on me, which I dont mind, but I need a very strong management triangle"
good,"The work is definitely not easy starting out at the bottom, as it was rather labor intensive at times, because the clientele are generally people who leech off the government and don't work, and therefore their homes are not always the most pleasant. However, there are exceptions to this, though not overly common, whom are people who are decent and only rent to perhaps past credit problems. Generally you would work 4 weekdays, having either Tue, Wed, or Thurs, off, and then working Saturday, and having Sunday off. Store hours typically 9 or 10am - 8pm weekdays, 9-7 Saturdays, with 1/2 hour lunch, and breaks, if you can squeeze them in. "
good,"Capacitacion en Tampico, Tamaulipas y Dallas Texas con duracion de 2 semanas cada uno, aprendi sobre los diferentes sistemas que se manejaban."
good,Need to value their employees better . People thats been working for yrs are making less money then new hires with no job experience.  Raises are based of everyone's work effort no an good idea. To much micromanagement.  Need to let store managers run there store as the see fit as long as they are making a profit and not foing illegal activities.  Need better hours and better work vehicles .
good,Could be a better job of u didn't work 1st and 2nd shift. The hardist part of the job is the early morning and then late nights. But the people the work there is great.
good,Company was okay just the staff was terrible and no communication or there was always issues in that store no one got along and we're always blaming each other and not working as a team
good,You can't really make any plans outside of work you work every Saturday lots of stores are short staffed so it puts more work on everyone. If the customers don't pay you can't go home until you have hit your numbers
good,"As this was a great job the management was not trained or to standards to handle a whole store of employees, never had a chance to advance , but worked extremely long open to close shifts along with managing other employees with out at title."
good,Working with some of the people who think they know it all and have been around the block a time or two need to open their minds to what other have to say and do. They need to keep in mind so.eone may be able to do it faster and better but they will never know because they will not be open minded
good,I would not have worked here if i knew the responcibilities that came with very low pay.Have close to no time outside of work.Come in at 9 am til atleast 7 pm sometimes 6 days a week because we are short staff for the most part
good,"Management had horrible attitudes and always expected male employees to do most of the heavy lifting. If we all (male and female) applied to the same job, then why weren't we all expected to perform at the same level? Also, having to ""repo"" people's things from their homes and etc was a very uncomfortable situation."
good,Love the job and for the most part the people. Just a lot of changes all the time from corporate. Quality of life is almost nonexistent. Employees that work with you don't always pull their fair share of the work.
good,"Great pay and benefits but there is no balance between work and life. As long as you are single and have no children, then this job is for you. Some locations have awesome people to work with and for while others, not so much."
good,its a job  not much balance not much room for growth they company owners are greedy and Should take in consideration about burning out employees by working them so much
good,"I loved my co-workers at Rent-A-Center; they were great people who carried themselves professionally although our work, at times was labor-intensive and frontline operations. My biggest gripe was that I was just settling into my position as a customer account representative when I was given an ultimatum; I would be required to collect on delinquent accounts in the field. I resigned with a heavy heart because I was good at my job; the one I was hired to do, and when I reached out to corporate they did not do anything about it, or the other issues that enveloped the store due to poor management. All of the people I worked with when I worked there are no longer employed with the company-even the bad manager; says a lot doesn't it?"
good,Don't like that you have to be there a year to get full-time and benefits. You can work your butt off and go above and beyond the call of duty and still not move up on the company.
good,"This company isn't realistic.They expect customers to rob a bank just so they can come in and make their payments. They make managers work on their days off if not they aren't consider a team leader. District managers don't give you the help you need. They expect for 2 people to do a 5 person job. Good managers, good employees and good customer leave because there is no professionalism. Most workers at human resource have no idea who rent a center works...but you learn how to work collections and sales. You also learn to handle bank deposites. You learn how to receive in new merchandize and transfer out. A lot of time you learn this on your own."
good,Gm blocked me after I was told I had til Wednesday to hold my job while I was going through sepsis treatment. Was hired while the man I replaced thought he was on medical leave.
good,Expected to only get 40 hrs a week ... Hrly rate competitive but without OT you spin wheels. Upper management makes business decisions based on feelings .
good,"If management is lacking then the policies change to benefit them. All Bonuses are not given evenly yet given to managers only. Only a handful actually give recognition to their employees, From Personal experience with 5 yrs in company the Store manager rarely performed any duties instead she took advantage of the younger workers and would put it all on them knowing that they couldn't possibly do their jobs 100% when performing her duties as well"
good,The day to day work in this company was very challenging. The company provided house hold items to its customers that could not get the items by any other means. I was hard doing this because even though we knew that the customer was in over their heads with how much the could/would get. we had to keep giving them merchandise and was graded on how much we could sell.
good,"This is a cool job for a kid fresh out of high school that needs some extra money. If you have family, NO!!!!! It's so time consuming. Your life revolves around this company. I didn't 2 years with RAC. It was tough but I had to find better."
good,Was expected to do make way to many deliveries in a short amount of time. What made it worse was that new manager was unfamiliar with area which made route planning very unorganized.
good,"The hours made it impossible for me to carry on my life at home. Also, with the negative attitudes from my co-workers and manager it started to change me as a person and I did not like that."
good,"Realizar conferencia con el Equipo, establecer metas y objetivos."
good,"A typical day at work is always nerve wrecking due to the energy of your supervisor. Due to the fact that his/her job is hung over his/her head by their superiors they do the same to us. No matter how much effort we work at and actually accomplish that day, its still seen as we are not contributing to do our jobs. Normally I start by trying to collect on my accounts that are past due, then try to be out and ready for deliveries so I do not have to sit in the office. "
good,"Tiene muchas ganas de crecer pero no estan dispuestos a invertir en sus empleados y como es una empresa familiar no hay crecimiento para los demas empleados, pocas prestaciones adicionales"
good,It was long hours with a lot of collection calls. If your ok with pushing sale and going over lease agreements then this is the job for you.
good,Training programs were not properly initiated leading to confusion in the workplace. Specific job roles were not set so the store ran insufficiently.
good,"Not much room for advancement. Hours are not the greatest, neither is the pay for someone seeking more of a executive type position with the company"
good,it was great until we had a regime change I we got a new manager and regional manger...and we were considered loose ends and let go
good,I really have nothing nice to say about this company other than the staff became somewhat familiar to me but not close enough to call them friends. The hardest thing for me was to witness their work ethics in how they would go about acquiring merchandise or payments on accounts that were in default. It sometimes made me ashamed to be a member of their staff.
good,"make customer delivery and service calls. also did sales on the store floor,assisted with credit runs daily."
good,"Like I said, you could make more somewhere else with more honest bosses, but..........the perks l got from some of the female customers on my accounts were WORTH IT!!!  I was guaranteed to get a ""favor"" AT LEAST twice a day!  One in the morning and one in the afternoon, not to mention the ones l turned down until the next day!!!  I slept great every night and really needed my rest on Sundays, because them chicks WORE ME OUT!!!  All l had to do was show them their statement where they were behind and the robes would open, the towels would fall to the floor or the tee shirts would come up and off. Depending on what time of the month it was, some would drop to their knees with open mouths. I mean all colors too, because the exorbitant rental rates and late fees were a lot for those low-rent single moms to handle, so someone like me would come along and fill a need. The things they were willing to do to keep me from reposessing  their stuff would make excellent video material! Now that l think about it, some of it did!!! Some of these chicks thought they were flick stars. Well, they are-----in cyberspace."
good,This a boring job with a lot of driving involved.  They also prey on minorities and lower economical statuses.
good,"I worked for RAC for about 3 years and my first year I had a wounderful management team that show me the rental business and it was great. I was able to tranfer with company and my goal was to work hard, learn fast and move up with the RAC family. I started out as a CAR and within 3 years I was store manager. I can't talk for all RAC but the one I was at, had no room for my rainbow life style."
good,It would be a wonderful place to work if the mgmt team was on one accord. The manager that I work for was very demanding and did not like to do things in the office but eat eat and eat. She was very rude to the employees and the customers. her main concern was her family and she made sure you knew it everyday.
good,This job is horrible you don't know when or why or getting laid off. Do poorly one week and your gone. No time for a life
good,"The workplace culture at Rent-A-Center was good and the job was fun for many, many years. Up until 2015 there was usually much to celebrate."
good,"Worked at rent-a-center for about a year and a half as a customer account rep."
good,"job takes all of your time 930-730 are the usual hours, a lot of pressure to meet company standards, a lot of furniture moving, good pay good benefits 401k, discounts etc"
good,"Promote positive environment, but threaten job. They attempt to keep you at work till 9pm on Saturdays to hit the needed numbers.  If you dont jobs are threatened"
good,"Sales goals were unrealistic. Majority of customer base were constant with late payments as well as malicious in most cases when contact was made. More often than not we were encouraged to work with customers that were unable to meet the most basic criteria for being customers. I.e: Steady employment, full down payment, etc."
good,It was very consistent with work a lot of driving a lot of unloading on & off the truck driving distances I just thought the salary could have been a lil more for the amount of work .
good,"Fun workplace with nice game room. Work culture is ok depending on the season. For IT, there is no clear direction to where the management wants to take it."
good,"customer are so disrespectful don’t pay their bills and employees get blame for it !! no life work balance hard to sell, always short staff not the best place to work at a"
good,"expect long hours and no time for family events  hard labor, customers angry cause the company is over charging them for being late. team is dope all act like a family."
good,Not somewhere I would recommend for family oriented people to work. The hours are no appropriate to have adequate time with your family. You don't ever have two days off in a row without submitting vacation leave.
good,"It's a good place to work if you don't have kids or a family. With good training and management it is pretty easy to advance. A lot of mandatory over time, say goodbye to your weekends."
good,Good company to work for if your single and do not have a family. Required to work long hours. They have a severe lack in upper management. Consistent leadership change along with expectations.
good,Its just a place to work themp until something else pops up the management needs work and needs to be more organized and work more on teamwork with everyone not just between the management
good,"Working at Rent-A-Center can be rewarding, and you will develop many useful skills, like customer relations and service, but the time spent at the job can drain the rest of your lifestyle"
good,"Collections, Sales and Managing the bill paying habits of customers who are past due on their accounts. I contacted customers to encourage making payment arrangements. Deliver and pick up rental merchandise. I also managed weekly truck and maintenance reports."
good,Rent-A-Center employees care about customers and each other.  The management was very hands on with the employees and the workplace culture encouraged collaboration between teams.
good,They worked and worked you and I felt like no matter how great you did you never did a good enough job for them. I went through situations when my kids needed my help because my wife was sick once in awhile and I told my boss I need a little time and they would either write you up or threaten your job
good,"The management team can be better, but everybody have the opinion about  it. Just have to work there and find out......................................"
good,Never had any time with family because they would not allow anyone to take off on Saturdays.  They were set days for each position.  Quality life with family was none.
good,A typical day at the job included collection calls in morning no less then 150 calls. Route management after calls. Pre loading of vehicles and deliveries. Home visits in between deliveries. After deliveries and home visits we returned to store to perform more collection calls and closing duties
good,Made delivery/pick up's with box truck with assistants sometimes and mapping out the route with mapquest application or use of your smartphone because they never provided that.
good,"Store manager was a poor excuse of a human. I did his job + mine+ others as well. The pay was decent for the year I worked there. But a very shady company. Work ethics are questionable at best. Customer  satisfaction was not important. (which I had a HUGE problem with)"
good,"Competitive work environment that requires 50+ hours per week. The job is physically , mentally, and emotionally challenging."
good,"I greatly enjoyed my time at RAC. The only reason I left was bwcause i was asked on a contant basis to work off of the clock my the Store Manager and DM. I also had to relocate due to family issues, so the time for me to cut ties had come."
good,sometimes stressful work load put on only sales floor person. need to hire more sales people. Hated making people rent things to fill a quota. to many calls to the same customer call logs weekly.
good,"i have learned a lot at this job, my first rent to own job and most likely the last. management could be better. planning is not the best at this store. the hardest part of the job is the double standards. the easiest part of the job is the deliveries."
good,"You work long hours and it can be very stressful. At rent a center you do both sales and collections everyday. It is rewarding when you hit the quotas set out for the day. A typical day is cleaning , sales, collections. Deliveries pick ups and service."
good,fun place to work if you aren't looking for a very serious job lack of advancement opportunities and leadership make your time here less enjoyable pay is decent
good,Its a job to have its easy the pay is low ...the amount of work you perform is unreasonable for the work they want from you...theres no bonus for sales they want you to meet
good,Not a career it's a good job for part timers but you won't be able to live alone off the salary. Not a place where you can balance your family/ home life.
good,"Back breaking work for little pay "
good,Dangerous place to work  and very demanding . Getting threatened by customers.  But never had support from management . I would stay far away from that company
good,"Job benefits not the best, didnt enjoy going to work. didnt feel safe.couldnt balance work and school. paid well but not worth the headache. just didnt enjoy the company."
good,"Long stressful hours, have to hit certain numbers and if you do not you can expect to work late or get punished. Not that much room for growth because you have a 5 person team and to move up can take years. Not a great place to work."
good,"I am responsible for advancing the company's retail positions in consumer"
good,not the best place to work they make u feel like desposible...i worked there a long time becouse the pay was well and i needed the job...i do not recomend this place
good,"Competitive environment with little understanding from high level postions about what actually happens with customers out on the road, in the office and procedurally. There is a huge disconnect on what is actually do-able."
good,well first everything that happens even if you havent been at work in a week is your fault you are reuqired to always work over and before without adaquite compensation as well as get no time off when asked  typical day at work is making 20 trips to the same place because communication and organization within management is bad
good,"If you are younger and need a temporary job, it will be Good, starts at 11$ an hour, which is decent for younger people, but is underpaid for the workload, management can be very selfish when it comes to deliveries and consideration of employees"
good,"Empresa aún adaptándose al mercado comercial y laboral mexicano, mala comunicación interna, cambios de estrategia constante."
good,meh dreery boring lack of advancment high turn around rate for all employees  harest part of the job is the repetitive talks with customers that obviously wont pay their accounts
good,Growth without training and labor is what they expect. If you can supply them with that you are perfect. I spent 22 years here and not 1 minute longer would I deal with the mismanagement that was going on.
good,"company is changing from employees getting 47-50 hours a week to no overtime. Hiring part time employees at $10.50 an hour with no benefits and getting rid of loyal full time employees. I was employed for over  15 years with 4 weeks vacation per year and being highest hourly paid employee in area. Was one of the first full time employee let go. Company is all about the $$$$. Don't care anything about employees. New motto is 3 part timers are better than 1 full time employee. You have weekly sales and collection numbers to meet and if they are not met, what are you doing wrong?! On top of that you are on truck 1/2 the day and still must hit those numbers! There is to be a no cell phone policy in the store but store manager is on his so most other employees sit in office on theirs."
good,I would not recommend this company to anyone. they have no care at all for there employee's. They are not concerned about retaining there employee's they work them to the bone and offer nothing in return
good,Delivery of goods and services. I learned how to repair and install household items like appliances and build furniture. Management was effective in delegation but lacking in development. Co-workers were pleasant and helpful. Hardest part of the job was delivering merchandise in any and all conditions. The most enjoyable part of the job was the travel invoved.
good,"Working for Rent A Center could be a great Job-if the management could remember that the customer account reps (the people who actually do deliveries and repossessions) are not allowed into customer houses without the customers permission. Management forgets that to maintain basic credit standards when a customer is not paying for merchandise, one must be able to pick the merchandise up and bring it back to the store. This is only accomplished with the customers cooperation. A customer account rep should not be fired if customers won't allow them to reclaim the stolen merchandise."
good,"Compensation was ok, but the work environment is horrible. You work long hours for little pay, lack of advancement unless people leave or quit,immature co-workers, and not to mention management who love to micro manage even when things are going just fine. Great job to get experience, but I would not make a career with them."
good,"if you like working all day and dirty homes, than this job is for you. The DM well you know your just a body that i easy to replace."
good,"The district manager could be better and stop shoving unrealistic goals down their employees throats.  Stop crying about not getting enough sales and or why the store didnt close or open as far as credit. "
good,If you enjoy spending time at work vs time at home then this job is for you. The hardest part of the job is meeting the expectations of the district manager. You will be told to do something one way then a few minutes later they tell you that you did it all wrong and scorn you for your approach.
good,"I have given years of my life to that blackhole! I went without Saturdays off, lunches and got home late. It caused a lot of grief but I sure did learn a lot. I can do anything now after having worked there. I see people all over that don't know half of what I know after having worked at RAC. They run you to death but you get educated the higher up you go."
good,"No comments, in general good place to work and has very friendly coworkers."
good,"Call customers about past due accounts."
good,"My day at work would be to call my route . collect payments prep the store check the trucks /company car...deliver merchandise in a timely fashion. I learned furniture in a whole as far as quality, brands and dimensions. also learned to be a better salesman"
good,"Apertura de tienda,revison de reportes de ventas ,cobranza,cuenta de clientes pendientes por pagar,checar inventario de articulos existentes,faltantes.Deposito de la venta del dia anterior,junta con el personal de ventas y cobranza para revisar los porcentajes alcanzables y no alcanzables para realizar un plan de accion,asi como ponerse la meta del dia en ventas y cobranza cuantas cuentas por recuperar.Deslindar responsabilidad al subgerente de ventas y al subgerente de cobranza."
good,I was responsible for collecting past due revenue from merchandise on rent with us.In addition i was also responsible for delivering and picking up merchandise on rent.
good,The money is good however if you have a family this is not the job for you.  You work 50 hours a week sometimes more and time off is next to impossible to get.  Days are 10-12 hours.  The job itself is not hard and easy to learn.
good,"work will start at 8;30am and we would prepare the floor for a welcoming environment for bot customers and employees. "
good,good fast money but very time consuming management is a joke only good about it is making 480-515 a week
good,Management does not care about the employees. All they care about is hitting a number. They will throw you under the bus to save their butts. You make decent money but the hours you have to put in leave no time for anything. There is little to no room for advancement. This place will burn you out with in a year...
good,high stress volume place to work . The work is not actually what they advertise it to be in the job description. come to the table prepared to handle conflict from all areas ALL day.
good,A fast moving and competitive work environment. Where you can develop close bonds with your coworkers as you work ten hour shifts in a day. The hardest part of the job is the long hours and strenuous physical work. The most enjoyable part is being able to work with customers.
good,cheack emails for review of daily key indicators
good,"the work was fine, delivery was fun, telemarketing was a total joke. They think harassing customers with calls 3-4x a week to come in and buy more stuff was ok."
good,"They job is good, but theres hardly any home life. you work from 9am to 8 pm."
good,"pay is great, but you have to work in all weather conditions and there is little to no chance of having a personal life"
good,I worked from 9am until 8:30pm or 9pm a lot days. I had Thursday and Sundays off. I learned a lot dealing with customer service. The management I had over me was terrible. It had alot to do with favortism. My favorite part of the job was making a positve impact on customers. It was not unheard of my position to be threaten by manager or district manager because unwilling customers that wont pay or return merchandise. Other co-workers were rude to customers. I worked hard for over 4 years for RAC but I am glad I am able to move on with my life. While working there you will have no personal time.
good,this was a low paying job with great expectaqtions long stressed fill days.
good,"It was fun at first, but after a while the the hours and the demands of the middle management wore you out in the end."
good,"Overall Rent A Center wasn't a bad place to work just extremely stressful.  Not much time for family, mandatory overtime and if a store manager you are expected to be there all time and expect a lot of text messages when you are off"
good,"Full time job that requires sales, travel, and sales. This job also involves building appliances and furniture. This job also involves team chemistry and having the ability to work with others."
good,Rent a Center is a difficult place to work they are a daily numbers driven place. One day your on top of the mountain next day you feel like they're ready to replace you. You are pressured to work late past your scheduled time and if you refuse you'll definitely here about it. This is from a 15 year employee.
good,"Under Corporate ownership Rent A Center was a great place to work. Now under new ownership, I  see the lack of respect they have for their employees. If you voice your opinion your Terminated."
good,"It was good pay but long hours. Must work every Saturday, no exceptions and often until after 6pm or later. Hard to have a family life when you work 9-7:30 everyday except Sunday. Had to take PTO a week at a time, not when you needed to."
good,"Although staff and manager friendly No encouragement or help to progress in this position. To reposes peoples items"
good,"Working at Rent A Center has definitely been an experience. "
good,"They need to be more considerate about people's lives. Make hours accordingly.  Besides that,  job is great. I would recommend cameras at all locations."
good,Training at Rent-A-Center is very important because you are dealing with not only Customers but also employees in the field. Very importaant to mult-task. Very Stressful job.
good,"At the time I was with them, the Colorado Springs market management was really good. I transferred to the Pueblo CO district and this was a totally different district. Did not follow policy and the management would make ghost sales. I would not recommend this market."
good,It's a business that is high sales and collections.  They refurbish anything from furniture to electronics and keep renting it out until they have made 10 times the value.
good,"As said above, good money but the company has no care for its employees. They constantly threaten your job, complain about over time but have unrealistic goals  that can not be done with 40 hours. The managers take the majority of the harsh treatment and are constantly insulted in front of their staffs. But the money is good."
good,This job Demands a lot of physical effort a lot of walking upstairs driving and picking up merchandise at least a hundred pounds if you are willing to work this type of job do apply
good,"In general the company is just a cold machine to provide services and generate jobs. nothing special."
good,I worked at Rent A Center just until I found a better job in banking. It was enough to get me through for about 5 months. I would not want to go back to work there.
good,Rent A Center overall is not a bad place to work. It gives you a chance to interact with customers on a one on one basis which helps build the business. Like every company it has its up's and downs but at the end of the day the customer comes first.
good,Not a good work life balance. If you have a family prepare them to eat dinner without you! The system is set up for you to perform to lose. The credit numbers are attainable but difficult to hit your sales goal at the same time. Which makes it stressful. Your position is always threatened and bipolar store managers and district managers. Decent insurance. NOT enough personal days or sick days. Just 2 a year. That's it.
good,I really did enjoy the job itself was very physical and kept in shape but I didn't agree with sening one person to deliver items that required 2 people
good,"Lots of new people to meet daily"
good,Overall the experience was ok. Good for a college student looking to make decent money. Your experience will be greatly determined by your store and your manager.
good,The company pays well upper management is terrible all the care about is there numbers no work life family life balance all or none for them work from 8am to 8 or 9pm and get fussed at if you leave early before 8pm. I was in the company for 8 years I never got a Saturday off to spend with my family and was always told if you want at your numbers you have to work you off day during the week. They are very number oriented and don't take any excuses
good,The company is not doing good so they push there workers to get impossible numbers. They dont care about your family they onlly car about there numbers and if your hitting them or not.
good,I do not wish to write a review for this company at this time. I have been with them for 10 years. Dedicated and loyal. I have nothing specifically to say
good,My typical work day at rent-a-center I will do credit checks / collect payments and sells calls from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m.. I will take lunch from 12 p.m. to 1 p.m.  after lunch I will begin delivering orders until 6:30 after delivers I'll begin cleaning and locking down the store.
good,"The culture at rent a center is great . However there is not much advancement out there for women. So far the pay is decent but not enough to make ends meet if you drive and go to school and need to eat. 350 dollars a week can help if the employee administers their money well, but everyone at the end of the day wants to make a decent pay to cover family and personal expenses. Personally I am not a fan of lying to customers about lengthy contracts , for the same quality of furniture that you can obtain at a more affordable price elsewhere. The same I can say for the technology. For instance a PS4 is valued at 700 or 800 dollars where  you can get it cheaper elsewhere."
good,"To be honest I did not like the job because it was lacking in so many areas.  No benefits, low pay for what you do, lack of working hours so that mean you do not get paid that."
good,Iys a god place to work quiet atvtimes but busy most of the time specially when u gotta do everyones jub around there poor management make poor business and stressful for other workers
good,Employee and customer are great. Love doing delivery. Love being on road and picking up product from other stores.I wish there was some hot water to wash your hand.
good,Management was clocking employees out for lunch breaks they didn't take. Selling merchandise that customer's couldn't afford on their budget just to get a sale then next week would have to repossess it due to non payment/couldn't afford. The area management was pompous and full of himself.
good,"Cold calls, as well as collection calls make up the bulk of the day, with a small amount of sales and out of store collections in between. Management sets some unreasonable goals for employees, and sometimes interferes with job duties. Very relaxed environment, and mileage may vary with different locations managers."
good,"I quit working at rent a center because the bad customers out weighted the good. i got attitude every day. My boss and many other co workers also had lots of negative attitudes. i didn't quit until my manager decided to insult me 3 times in two days, then he kept directing me how to do my job based off his inability to do my job my way. He kept making me late to deliveries, rushing me where i didn't need to rush, and always blamed me for it. even though i did what he said. i would never recommend this rent a center 4926 to anyone. There is too much drama within the staff and with Customers."
good,"This job is for someone that does not mind not to be home to much, it’s hard work and long hours, I just could not do the long hours anymore, and be away from my family."
good,"The company itself is great for single people. I found it difficult to manage a healthy home life as the demands of the job. The company is strict on their standards. Often working my day off and staying late on the weekend in effort to hit their numbers. I remember working till 9pm on a Saturday when the store closed at 6pm. The employees and customers are great and make the job easier. The upper management is tough. This is a number based business and management had a high school mentality. If they don't like you, they will get rid of you."
good,Not a great place to work but it helps pay the bills. Management sucked. coworkers sucked and very lazy. customers sucked. However its very slow and relaxing if you don't like doing much.
good,"I would not work here if you plan on furthering your life or education. The hours are badly timed, and you work during the most awkward hours. You will have time for nothing else."
good,My main reason for leaving this job was the poor quality of the management at the particular store at which I worked. I was regularly required to perform tasks which were not in my job description such as distributing fliers due to poor sales. Other drivers I worked with were either unqualified or unwilling to stay with the company long term. This reflects negatively more on my particular manager than the company generally.
good,Minimal sales mostly product maintenance and delivery.  I was mostly working on account collection and delivery and also payment collection in store. the delivery was difficult sometimes because of its location and the type of product to deliver.
good,it is difficult work and working sales can be tricky but if you have the right crew and a good leader it can be fulfilling. the work environment is laid back but professional.
good,"learn how to deal with people, great training ground if you want to be a better manager. gives or set you goal. the hardest part of the job is when you collect money from your customer at their house"
good,"RAC offer benefits but no benefits that doesn't come out of employees pockets, it also offers great chances for advancements depending upon you work effort thats probably the only thing I was looking forward to when I started working there"
good,"Very little opportunity for advancement, extremely stressful work environment, compensation is not equal to the amount of effort put in, high chance for injury."
good,Typical Hours are 9-7 every day but Sunday. Always trying to make you stay until 9pm. Don't really care about employees. Everything is about sales even if you know someone is going to steal your merchandise.
good,"To be good at RAC you must excel in a number or areas, sales and collections chief among them. Additionally, intense periods of manual labor do occur. "
good,"the first year i worked at RAC were great, as a delivery man i made a solid living and was able to advance in the company, can get hectic and overwhelming sometimes. i learned a lot about installing appliances and learned to deal with difficult customers and situations. management was very iffy some store managers were great some where terrible, i felt i did a satisfactory job with our credit program"
good,"Low pay for the hours, you work hard not a lot of room to move up, stressful job with a lot of demand out of you. One day its one thing another its different"
good,Working at Rent-A-Center all depends on the customer base around you. The location I lived at had terrible customers and we were constantly repossessing our merchandise. The only thing that made the job enjoyable were the co-workers.
good,"following up with customers, making about 200+ calls, daily. Pass due visits and collections. Helping out with sale calls, make sales and helping out with deliveries."
good,"Lots of customers complaints,very rude and indesive people."
good,"A typical day at work for a PDS is very predictable being that your a delivery driver for a Furniture Company. Let's just say the quicker you start the sooner it'll be all over .Hopefully! I learner a  thing or two about couches and refrigerators If I ever decide to take the risk of moving into a home own my own. Nothing too enlightening."
good,"Management stayed frustrated yelling at workers, didn't have the proper safety lifting gears to perform your work. barely any teamwork but on deliveries and sales sometimes without loosing focus we will have a strong drive but most of all bad management"
good,No family time the company is all about numbers u work hard and hit the numbers for the store manager to get the credit there is no loyality at rac
good,I loved working for the company but with anywhere your happiness with your job is going to depend on those above you and around you. There are great managers in Rent-A-Center but there are also bad ones and depending on which kind you end up under it will either be heaven or He||
good,"A typical day in rent a center would be start of making a 50-100 calls every morning to past due customers. We attend to every customers need/wants, also help the walk ins. We also make sales calls to our customers that apply through our website."
good,"Low pay, hard work, and job constantly being threatened. Managers train you enough to do their job, and really don't care as long as their boss isn't screaming in their ear. "
good,"You have to speak Spanish even if you work in a location that is not the majority of the population. (Miami only!!!) There are some employees who cannot speak one word in English let alone understand. Every Storage Manager is different. I'd worked with a couple. Just do whatever he/she say no matter if it is ethical, or not. That is  if you like your job. If you do not comply, then you will end up doing all the most hated jobs. When they tell you they have the right to call you in to work from 8am-9pm Monday - Saturday, um it the truth. This wouldn't be a problem but I for one have a personal life and do not like working 6 days a week especially on short notice. If you are good at what you do then you will obtain favoritism from the head bosses. This is good if you are trying to move up in the company, bad when  you are envy because you actually do your job.  As assistance be prepared to get your boss lunch on your break and not his/hers and jump whenever he/she say so.  There 're a lot of people who still work there that unhappy because the company, or boss wrong them one way or another. "
good,"Hours are being cut, Insurance is changing to cost coworkers more, Overall This was a great place to work when i first started and yes it did have its issues as does every job. Then RAC joined to stock market and the whole business changed from a family oriented business to a business that no longer values the work of its coworkers."
good,You will get paid weekly.  Unable to eat lunch on premises. Unable to store lunch on premises. No drink allowance or drinks provided while outside of store.  Water sometimes provided in store.
good,"Rent A Center is a very demanding place to work for. A typical day at work is an understatement because no one day is ever the same. Throughout the years that I have worked for this company I have learned a lot about managing time, activities, and people. The co-workers that i have are always great people because of the fact that we all have different experiences to share and that helps with job responsibilty. We can all help one another based on the experiences that we have had at our previous places of employment. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the hours that we have to work on a daily basis and the amount of tasks that we are required to complete in a days work. I think that we are so busy trying to get reports and paperwork turned in to upper management that it takes away from the opportunity to provide good customer service and teach it to our employees properly. The most enjoyable part of the job is that everyday is like an adventure. You walk through the door and know that this day will be completely different from the day before. its a new opportunity to make a difference in something that you may not have did so great the day before!"
good,"nice work enviroment, i learned how to install appliances, refurbish used goods,co workers were nice to work with. the hardest part of job was all the heavy lifting on a daily basis and getting customers to make on time payments. i enjoyed being out in the field meeting new people and learning and driving around city."
good,"They promote that they are family oriented, but you don't have much family time,"
good,"This company claims to give both customers and employees ""quality of life,"" when in fact they take the life out of you.  You are require to work 48-50 hours per week and are hounded the entire time by upper management.  If you're doing one thing right then everything else is wrong.  Also, for with the money upper management makes and the overpricing of merchandise, retail store employees are not paid nearly enough."
good,This place is extremely hard to work at given the harsh demands put on you on a day to day basis. There is zero balance with work and your home life and your job is constantly threatened so you never feel secure. Besides the people I worked with it was terrible. You are overworked and under appreciated
good,I would clock in around 9 am and review the schedule of deliveries which was prepared the night before. Then id load the truck with all the merchandise needed for the days work. I'd then transport to various location around the city.
good,"I would answer phones, help the customers deal with their account. Deliver and pick up all the merchandise."
good,"Hard work, not compensated accordingly! The boss at the time thought he was a drill Sargent. This was a job you get to pay the bills."
good,"The company is ok but the hours are terrible. you have no life at all. by the time you get out head home, eat, shower, etc its near 1 am and you have to be at work at 9 the next morning. Pay is decent but the hours are trash"
good,A typical day was to check my previous day results sales and collections. See where the focus should be that day. Bring this information to my team and motivate them to execute the goals put forth.Train any employee needing any help with executing the goals. I learned how get better results from my team using different motivation tools. I learned how to sell products better.  Also i learned how to build a business and control profit and loses. My coworkers helped me obtain great success working with them. Management could've been better but they got the job done. The hardest part of the jobs were the hours. Very long days never have two consecutive days off. Never have a weekend day off. The most enjoyable part about the job was when i was store of the month for two years straight allowing me to be a top performing manager. Sending me on nice trips because of my top performance. They sent me and my  wife to hawaii one year and the next year to mexico and belize on a cruise.
good,I have worked for rent a center off and on for about 3.5 years i've been as high up as store manager but have stepped down to better manage school. Everything in the company was fine until my original district manager was promoted to a bigger district the incoming district manager immediately proceeded to get his people into positions and remove their incumbents.
good,I had a very poor on-boarding experience. My job duties remained unclear  for over a month until a senior manager from an other store explained them to me and helped me schedule my day around them. This was mainly due to the fact that my manager didnt really know how to manage or train new people.
good,"Not a big fan, you will have to rip a lot of people off. Very Busy in the NYC area."
good,My experience with Rent-A-Center was not a good one.  I know that doesn't reflect on the company because sometimes poor management does slip through the cracks and that is what happened in this case.
good,the only good thing about rent a center was the pay and benefits.  I worked 50+ hours a week. I barely saw my family and my wife had just had a baby and they didn't even wanna give me time off for that
good,"At the top of the day, we make calls to customers that are due and to customers that are past due. After making calls to due customer, we load the truck with merchandise for our new customers and make collections runs for our current customers that are not making payments. This position is self motivated because you spend a lot of time on the road alone and if you are not focused on performing you will not meet your goals. In this positions, maintaining good relationships with your co workers is very important because there are only 5 people inside each store, so you become a small family. The most difficult part about my position is the making sales goals because we spend the majority of our time outside of the store, so we have to struggle and fight for sales daily in order to remain in good standing with the company. The most enjoyable part of the position is the opportunity to learn about the business, dealing with the customers face to face and the collections portion of the job."
good,I've worked for the company going on two yes and so far I've experienced various parts of the job and staff then I would have even expected. Let's just say they make idiot decisios often.
good,On a typical day I would sell a few items and later on deliver the items to a customers home. Everything is good except when you have ignorant customers.
good,"this is not a job for someone with a family , you have no life outside of rent a center"
good,call route handle deliveries take payments help with sales how to build new furniture management was very helpful co workers friendly into there jobs hardest part running tracking down none payers  dealing with customers
good,"Excellent compensations and benefits offered. "
good,"Spent 2 hours in the morning calling customers who's payments were due that day or past due. spent the rest of time till lunch traveling to other stores to pick up merchandise for afternoon deliveries. took a 30 min. lunch break,and made delivery's. return to storee spend the next 2 hours calling customers who were due that day or past due"
good,The relationships between the employees created a great and comfortable working atmosphere.
good,"Rent a center is a rent to own based buisness. no credit checks required but there is a sales and credit process set forth.A typical day at rent a center would consist of maintaining sales, getting in contact with customers in reguards to handleing past due accounts, makeing deliveries of merchandice to customers, providing customer service weather it be via telephone or personally in the field, and the maintanance of inventory daily. Most stores are operated by a crew of 5. store manager, assistant manager, sales manager, and 2 account managers. The hardest part of the job for me is the hours. Being a husband, father of 3, and needing to finish college is kind of stretched thin when working a 50+ hours a week schedule. Account managent is a wounderfull job to have. knowing that you have done all you can to help improve someones elses quality of life makes it all worth while."
good,60+ hours lifting heavy furniture by yourself. No time off for family functions like children's school functions.
good,long hours but good pay had a problem with top management thats why i no longer work there
good,"A typical day at Rent A Center would be to get the sales floor rent ready. Assist customers as they come in with bill payments, new merchandise. Coach, train and develop the customer account representatives on new processes and procedures. Ensure telemarketing calls were made, the daily schedule was adhere to. Manage customer account files."
good,"Benefits are not good, you got to be in the ""Club"" if you want to advance to district manager. Sucks having to go into low income neighborhoods trying to repossess merchandise from thieves."
good,"A good foundation to learn the skill of managing a business and various personnel. The most satisfying experience was assisting in restoring the pride to some the customers by helping them aquire ownership of the merchandise they were renting. I hired a group of employees that also took pride in being the best which made my job easier. I learned that there is always a solution to most problems, it is only a matter of finding it."
good,This work enviroment isn't healthy. They say one thing and want you to do another.
good,Fast turn around. Fun job to work for someone without alot of responsibilitys.
good,Created a fun place to work. Limited oppurtunity to advance with contraction above store manager level.
good,I almost accomplished a lot of my goals at this company but the rug was taken from under me.
good,I worked at Rent a Center for about a year. It was a fun job i made decent money and got plenty hours. I liked that if you can produce than they have a spot for you. I advanced from CAR to CM in about 6 months. Ultimately i was terminated for violated training i did not receive.
good,Well kept and maintained employment available to all seeking equal opportunity employment. Various benefits and opportunities for growth through employment experience.
good,"There is a clear lack of vision at the top of Rent-A-Center and their focus and goals change on a whim. I'm not sure where it starts, but it definitely takes it's toll on store managers who are under constant pressure to push horrible ideas passed down to them. "
good,Fast pace job! I gained a lot of customer service experience with RAC. I had a lot. The hardest pasrt of my job was turning away cutomers that didnt qualify.
good,"easy work, just sit around, do deliveries, pick peoples stuff up when it needs to be picked up and keep the store looking nice, would still be there if they didnt shut the store down"
good,Rent a Center is behind the times with their business practices and culture. They are a reactive company that has difficulty retaining talent. Management training at this company is a joke. Store Managers are expected to to put their lives on hold to meet the needs of the corporation. Not a bad gig if you do not have a family or do not like them much.
good,"job was ok, didn't really enjoy having to take a child's bed because the parents couldn't make there payments or making consistent calls too peoples home and work place to collect a payment or the merchandise"
good,your only as good as you are today. high turn over rate and very stressful  they ask alot but dont offer raises to do other peoples jobs. but you do et discounts on merchandise
good,You have to be a certain type of person to work here. Long hours and always had more than 40 hours a week. The culture is meh... delivery and sales and making sure customers paid their bills on time...bad culture.
good,"Decent starting pay, Opportunities for advancement if there long enough, Excellent co-workers, Establish relationships with customers, sometimes unattainable goals"
good,"Rent A Center provides opportunities for promotion from within, with hard work and dedication. However the work/ life balance isn't good and long hours are required."
good,"You have to have a opened mind when you work there. You will be delivering or picking up furniture, appliance, electronics and so on. You will see some sad living conditions and bugs."
good,Just not good if you want a life outside of work. They pretty much force you to have work as a priority over your personal life. Which personally isnt fair
good,"This job is very intense. You have to be very strong willed, tactful and outgoing to do this job. Dealing with unruly customers makes you learn patience"
good,Good place to work if pay was better the management was really good but he couldnt do anything for you cause there was 15 people above him the district manager janet only cares about the company not the employees
good,If you have the right manager the job is fun. However it is a very physical and demanding job . Sales expectations are a bit high but not unreachable.
good,It’s a challenging position for sure.Just work hard and You’ll be fine. It gets a little crazy but just keep your cool. That’s all I can do is tell you that you will work long hours.
good,Rent to own is a great career! There is always something new everyday. With not having the same day it challenges me to find new ways to meet deadlines and a profit.
good,This company demanded long hours for low pay. Poor hours of work. Poor company policies for employees and towards companies. Too concerned about making numbers that they set there customers up for failure. Sell them things they know they will not be able to afford just to raise numbers.
good,"The job is a easy job , the problem is how the District Manager run the stores. They make people move from store to store because of high turn over that is management fault."
good,Go in early get out late and forget about spending any family time with your love ones. The pay is good for the amount of work that is required but you have to give it all your time.
good,"Rent a center is not a career job. It’ does not have retirement,pention. The benefits it carry is only 401k I do not see my self being here long only momentary."
good,"The service they provide for customers is fantastic, however the quality of work/life balance is very minimal.  The demand to hit the numbers on a weekly basis is sometimes unattainable with the situations we are faced with.  Upper management seems to demean and harp on those, but never acknowledge the work that is above average."
good,Rent-A-Center offers a very nice and relaxed workplace also fun at times different little events for the kids some opportunity in advancement good career opportunities
good,"be earliest as possible , prepare to face new goals  everyday, get ready  to suit your self to a changing  work  environment as management change goals constantly , organize your  self and your team, remember to be the last to leave."
good,"working with customer daily "
good,"very stressful job  "
good,I made decent pay but i had no chances to do anything with it. Scheduling sucked and it took time away from my family. Many nights my wife and kids went to bed alone and woke up and i was gone. If it werent for some of the impossible expectations the job would be awesome but as employees we were pretty much punished for customers not paying their bill.
good,"Scheduling pickups and deliveries, setting up repairs, constant inventory, Collections and sales, management of 5 to 7 employees as well as satisfying customer complaints"
good,"employees were a little more friendly then professional "
good,I thoroughly enjoyed working with the store manager she is a good person but difficult to work with. The company its self needs some improvement in a lot aspects this company does not understand that work DOES NOT come before family/kids. You are required to work your personal life around this job. Anything that has to do with your children be prepared to pray that your children wont inconvenience your manager or the store in general.
good,"Can be a little shocking at first, but eventually, if you hang around, you'll get it!  No two days are the same, and just when you think you've seen it all, there will be a new contender! lol  Overall, I didn't mind the job.  You will learn to be assertive with customers, that's for sure, because if you don't, they will devour you!  Oh, and don't wear dress pants, environment can be quite dirty and disgusting. (Don't let the bed bugs bite)"
good,"You are never at the same store for more than 6 months and always switching team members not allowing for store cohesion. The benefits are fine, but pay is a little low for all the travel time."
good,"I like working for RAC. However, they stay under staffed which causes the work load to be high. Other then that it's an alright place to work. RAC employee purchase program is awesome!"
good,Schedule at work is horrible. One day 14 hours next 5 next 10.5. Never a 9 hr work day. You leave very late the day before your day off and have to be in very early the day after. Make no sence.
good,"Long hours"
good,a typical work day lacked consistency. I may be in the store attempting to make commission. I may be on the phone calling customers with reminders that their bill was due. I may be on the truck helping with deliveries and pickups
good,I really enjoyed my time at Rent A Center. I would have loved to stay employed by this company but my direct management created a hostile environment.
good,With a focus on meeting sales goals it is impossible to keep up with every customer which causes people to not pay their bills or not do business with us. Managers are rude and have no organizational skills . Managers yell and argue with customers and then send employees to deal with frustrated customers they just cursed out.
good,I enjoyed my time with RAC until the company really started to lose money and put extra pressure on employees to get people into rental contracts they couldn't afford.
good,its a very unprofessional job & very messy. The employees did not know how to work together as a team nor keep the delivery truck clean and up to date.
good,The favorite employees work together while others are sent out alone to collect payments or repossess the merchandise.  Refused any help for two man deliveries that had to go up flights of stairs.
good,"Working here, there are a lot of long 10 hour days. The franchise corporate management are some awesome guys. My immediate manager (Regional) lacks a lot of interpersonal skills."
good,"50+ hour work week, which made life-work balance very tough. The expectations from upper management were at times unrealistic. The weirdest thing is that the culture changed a lot from PR to FL; it was like working for two different companies."
good,"i do not want to do the review of this company, not at this time. I find this step very unnecessary for applying for a new job. I do not understand why you need reviews of companies."
good,Working on a daily task by keying invoices and reconciling a certain numbers by a time frame. New task excel. Very anti social  rude supervisors & managers. Walking in the door. Interacting with the people at work.
good,Co workers and management was great to work with. Going on deliveries and pick ups were sometimes difficult. The pay rate was great and so were the benefits.
good,Typically hours are long and last through the day into the evening. Depending on the personnel work environment varies. The hardest part of the job is navigating within heavy urban areas. The most enjoyable part of the job is the gratifying feeling you get from helping customers attain things that they may not able to get by conventional means.
good,"Good company, but little time off. Long hours for management, abusive district managers. Good pay and benefits, great customers and good people to work with."
good,Not bad prices but the way its being ran could change. organization is not very productive either. trucks stayed messed up. manager likes to get an attitude instead of helping. nobody works together.
good,Hours are set during retail time frames and can extend further into the evening with no notice if numbers are failed to be met. Not good for a family life.
good,"On a typical day, you would usually bring the vehicle around. A manager would then instruct you on which items are going out for delivery that day. If no deliveries were scheduled, you would maintain a clean and stocked showroom floor. In my time here, I learned more about time management and hard work. Management was okay; most days were smooth, however some days were very stressful. Co-workers were very police and welcoming. The hard part of the job would be working with the heavier couches and getting them to fit into a customers home without damaging merchandise or home(I.e. awkward doorways where maneuverability is very limited.) The enjoyable parts were that on occasion, the Manager would buy lunches."
good,It would be a fun place to work if the hours weren't so long and if there was a different district manager who always has something negative to say never any thing positive Co workers are great hard workers and very dedicated my short term disability came in handy when I had my new bundle of joy great job sercurity they need to cut there prices lower people are willing to pay within there budget times are hard so at least give them something they are comfortable paying collecting payments could be rough at times cause so people like to steal which makes my job hard cause now everybody are begin looked at as thieves and I was a sales manager never took advantage of these people always got them the player deal I was very loved by my customers and Co workers bitter sweet
good,It was a great company when I first started working there then everything changed when they started to bring in unqualified managers.
good,where your job is always in danger and they threaten you with being fired constantly if you don't sell and collect the money from the rented merchandise. my day was filled with my employees herrassing customers  and taking back merchandise it was aweful. but i did learn how to be a very good customer service manager and treat ppl with respect.
good,"Ok place to work,a lot of things done that shouldn't be,a lot of foolish games and no time at home with family"
good,"They have a high rate of turnover, they run a corporate schedule to a tee.  They also have great training program.  You deal with a lot of sales an collections."
good,"I was a former employee of Rent A Center for almost 4yrs. Started out as a CAR , where i came in doing my daily calls to customers, getting my log book together  and after an hr or 2 of that went out on deliveries. After 6 months moved up to Asst Sales Manager, where I was on the sales floor and keeping the floor fully furnished and rent ready. Had a great manager and she moved up to be my DM. Well later we got another DM and the things went down hill. Never had a problem with the company until he came. This guy made me feel uncomfortable being there. Before I would get off he would be outside watching inside my store. On my days off I could tell someone had been in my office. Come to find out he was in there snooping. I dealt with it for about 5 months and I was done with the childish things. I had a solid team until 1 wanted my position. My district was going down hill with this new guy... Loved RAC but not the BS"
good,A numbers based business built on customer relationships. Most rental agreements have a term of 15 to 24 months and 90% of customers pay weekly. A positive customer experience is required each and every day for successful results. Very gratifying when all goals are met.
good,"This company was ok, major area of problem would be the physicality of moving the furniture and some of the conditions that this would entail."
good,This is a high energy position where sales and numbers are the main focus. Long hours are demanded and job security is minimum upon performance.
good,Work/life balance is horrible. You have required overtime so ultimately you dont get back to back days off. Not good for people with families. Management is on your back constantly if your not hitting your numbers. The pay is okay if you agree with doing hard manual labor for an hourly rate. We work ten hour days but only receive 30 minute breaks that at times we work during
good,Great customers to deal with.  Not very strong support from upper management.  No room for creativity.  Company is all about the numbers.  Can be rewarding if you like working with people and developing strong relationships with customers.
good,Was a okay place to work if you want to have long hours and not enough pay. the expect way too much from there employees at times.
good,"The most challenging part of being a manager of a team is keeping each person motivated. All people come from a diverse background and are motivated in different ways. I have found in my years of experience that creating friendly competition in the work place is the best way to engage and challenge employees. A typical successful day starts with planning, then effectively communicating the plan to each employee descriptively explaining their roll and their goals. Ask for feedback and ask them to bring up any challenges they may have with achieving their goal. After this takes place it is all about follow up and feedback. Are they on pace for achievement or are they on their way to failure. Give praise where it is needed and help those that are on the wrong path. Every day brings different challenges and a way that I can help strengthen my team to work towards success."
good,"I enjoyed who I worked with however the expectations of sales while still being out on the road all day delivering furniture was a little questionable. Also having to do collections wasn't my idea of fun. I hated seeing people who had a bad month financially, having their couch or bed taken away. Especially when I knew that's where their entire family was having to sleep. Management was pretty nice overall to me but apparently a few people did not like our district manager but thats not my problem."
good,"It is a fun job and I love all the people I help, but the balance with work and home is not there. I am at work all the time. And to be fair it is what I signed up for and knew all about the long hours but my life has changed and i need a change."
good,"Pay was ok, but the job was crazy.  Terrible work schedule and hours depend on customers payments.  Very hard to reprocess children s bunkbeds in front of said children."
good,"My work day started with me first doing the daily reports to log and expenses from the day before, ex: gas. The reports also logged the revenue that was made, customer gains, customer loses and new inventory received in the day before. I then was responsible for getting the account manager's call list ready so that they can begin calling customers whose accounts were past due. Once that was complete I was responsible for completing an inventory of all merchandise in the store."
good,Working for Rent a Center is really good money the only bad thing is that being a girl and having no kind of protection on your own is really risky. Doing repos on people they will attack. Being out so late waiting on the customers to be home is dangerous.
good,start collections then start deliveries. no work life balance.
good,A typical day at Rent-A-Center would consist of making calls to customers in the morning either letting them know their account is due or is past due and that a payment is needed. Next I would go do any deliveries we had scheduled that day which included lifting electronics or furniture into peoples homes. After that I would come back to the office and make sales calls or make my second round of calls for my route. If any customers came in we would assist them on the sales floor and if were getting low on merchandise on the floor we would have to either go to storage and pick something up or bring something from the backroom to set up. I learned how to speak to customers about there accounts and also how to properly assemble furniture/electronics. The management was very stressed out about hitting daily and weekly numbers and it showed towards the employees. Co-workers we're stressed out out because of the long hours and having to do so much physical labor on a daily basis. The hardest part of the job was trying to get my route to make payment on time and the most enjoyable part would be going on the road to do deliveries.
good,"Its a fun environment, however the work load and hours are strenous"
good,"this company takes a lot from you, its not for everyone the pressure is definitely their. Numbers have to be met and management doesn't take any mercy on you. So, be prepare  to work long hours deal with customers that make it seem as you owe them something and a hole lot of accountability, with minimal quality of life."
good,"the hours sucked, co-workers were great, dumb policies."
good,"A typical day working at Aaron's (accounts dept)"
good,cumple en parte con la parte humana el ambiente es bueno y los equipos de trabajo son equilibrados
good,You meet a lot of great customers that you build relationships with. On the other hand for me being a mother of 2 working 50 hrs. a week was the weakness for me. Money is ok but you have to put up with a lot just for the money hey give you. This is a stressful job and you have to have the mentality for it.
good,enjoyed meeting and helping customers but management was unreliable and insufficient when helping problem solving for customers.
good,nothing really negative to say about the job other than they have very long hours and there is no work life balance
good,"The work itself wasn't too bad. Show up at 8:00, leave at 5:00. Work load in my department wasn't overwhelming. Most people seem friendly overall and easy to work with.  "
good,did not work there long. I enjoyed my co-workers but not the job. The job takes a toll on the body.
good,"Needed to perform all sides of the house, from sales to credit calls and collections, as well as making deliveries and service calls. .75 cent pay raise to be a ""manager"", not worth the 55 hours a week required to make a living."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of multi-tasking throughout the day and working together as a team to meet daily quotes.  Daily goals consisted of cold calling in efforts of soliciting business, following up with customers to ensure timely pay of merchandise, setting up floor display, closing of sales, confirmation of pay and references, on-time delivery of merchandise, retrieval of unpaid merchandise,  proper closing of store for end of day.  The job itself was not hard, however it required long hours such as 12 hours days for 6 days a week with no overtime pay.  I enjoyed working with my team and the success we produced from working together on one accord."
good,I've been threaten several times from customers also deliveries are usually dangerous and in dangerous areas
good,"reviewing accounts calling past due accounts checking emails answering phones calls,returning calls checking paper work,filling out new paper work ,checking deliveries,paying bills and calling referrals also calling to verify references and employment and residence on all accounts,and writing reports and printing reports,scheduling appointments, and meetings and managing my coworkers and keeping them on track with their duties,the hardest part of the job is a unpleased customer or employee and the best part is keeping almost everyone pleased and getting paid for your hard work."
good,"Great place to get your feet wet with sales, meet new and exciting people"
good,"At first working with Rent-A-Center seemed to a smooth ride, no pun intended. After a few weeks of long hours and constant strenuous work, lets just say I as hitting ditches left and right. Now, dont get me wrong the pay is decent and you can definitely make due, if you put in the work. Then again it may depend the supervision you're working under."
good,i enjoy staying busy but this job was all no breaks stay busy for 10 hours straight
good,i would open resgisters and get all paper work together call people for verification and then walk around store greeting coustomers and telling them bout our program 
good,"when things go great you'll get no notice, when things are good you suck, when things are bad you'll hate your life. ok pay for way too many hours. you work late on every holiday. no matter what you'll only get two days off, ever. (one week day, (tues-thurs) and always sunday) only 2 sick days for first yr then after first yr you get 2 weeks. over all if you have no education, no family to take care of, and can take being talked down to this could be for you. be prepared to deliver heavy stuff, take money from people that dont want to give it to you, clean, and work way too much. you go to work, go home, eat, and sleep then go right back. not a good place for a mom. on an up side you learn a lot of customer skills and they keep track of your rankings so if you do good its good to keep for a ""brag book"" so you can move up in the world. "
good,"I started in Oct '09, six months later, was store manager. That's when it started downhill.  This job is great if you have no children and single, They expect you to give up life & family. They preach family values, but I didn't experience it. If you don't get your weekly sales/credit goals, DM makes you feel worthless.  The stress level is horrible. You hear how the upper management started in a store but somewhere along the way, they forgot how it was to actually work in a store on a day to day basis."
good,I currently work from 9am-9pm five days a week were paid every week. the hardest part of my job is working long hour with my child.
good,I liked my job but my co workers were horrible to work with. The store manager slept all the time and the work just got pushed around. I was even doing their jobs because no one else was.
good,"Open store, fill showroom, open safe and count money from the day before, sell sell sell. Absolutely no work/ life balance. people are lazy."
good,"Rented products, called customers to encourage on time payments. Trained employees on various aspects of the rent to own business. Hardest part of the job was collections. The most enjoyable part of the job was the pay."
good,"If you like to start work at 8am and leave at 8pm almost every single day, then go ahead and work for them. If you appreciate being told that your job is way more important than anything else in you life, including family, then by all means, work for them. Wake up, go to work, come home and sleep. Everyday. Unprofessional bosses."
good,"Company is a great one to work for, but I think that managers should keep employees information confidential, and not share it amongst other employees."
good,"This company as a whole to work is great bt the store in Douglas and surrounding areas don't stand on wht the company is supposedly founded on or stands ,which is honesty and integrity ,if u get in the rite store with a great crew rent a center is a good place to work .....and would advise all customers to receive and verify all reciepts and balances when dealing with Douglas rent a center"
good,"I enjoy the people I work with, but some of the customers are awful and are often hostile. The work day is loaded every day without time for breaks, and personal safety as far as lifting isn't taken seriously."
good,"a typical day open to close 9 am to 8 pm. 48 plus hours a week. My desk is always full of customer files awaiting verification and sales leads to follow up with. my routine open store, check store email, check any web leads, prepare sales DAP (daily planner), prepare door hangers for delivery drivers to flyer, verify any unverified orders, greet customers, take payments, answer phone calls, close sales, maintain showroom by replacing sold merchandise, making sure tags are on every item and are priced correctly, telemarket current customers, references, and customer refferals, close up the store, count the till, perform receipt audit, run end of day on the system. Sometimes perform deliveries or pickups."
good,"Good coworkers, Company is Very Conservative. Internet restrictions. No casual fridays, managers are supposed to wear formal shirt with tie everyday!"
good,"A typical day at work revolves around ""hitting your numbers"" rental agreements. Expensive price for the target market, I've learned customers will give you every excuse in the world to avoid a payment on their rental merchandise!"
good,Senior Managment has not wholly embraced the Servant Leadership values they claim to hold others accountable to.
good,"i worked for rentacenter for 3 years and basically started at the lowest position and worked my way to the store manager position in a couple of years-the pay was great, no complaints there. however, the pressure from upper management and the constant nagging made it pretty much unbearable. They expect you to pretty much eat, sleep, and breath rentacenter. they are never happy with the numbers you produce and when things go well it seems like they will ALWAYS find something that you can and MUST improve. the rent to own business is very cutthroat as a whole, i know this, but come on in times like these not everybody is willing to pay double or even triple the price of an item just because they do not require a credit check. It is not always possible to close every sales lead that walks through the door but let the district mgr's and regional mgr's tell it and they will make it seem like there is something wrong with YOU!!! Pretty much if you have kids and a wife or even a girlfriend or maybe even somewhat of a social life...this job is not for you!!! working from 9am-8pm(M-F) and 10am-7pm(SAT) leaves very little time for anything else and on top of all that to have to be stressed out the whole time you are clocked in, to me the pay was STILL not worth it!!!!"
good,This is a job that will keep you busy with the companies high standards. You must master the skill of multitasking to become proficient in the company.
good,This job gives you 48 hrs per week 5 days per week every saturday working.
good,"Great company to work for, great people to work with, always finding ways to help the consumer"
good,It was an ok job just it didnt seem like a well maintained work environment . Need more focus and they past up some people for management positions who was qualified to hire someone from the outside.
good,Schedule changes at last minute to include working up to 3 hours after close was too much to handle. Corporate micro management superseded direct supervisor.
good,"As a store manager the day can be very busy with interviewing scheduling, doing deliveries and verifying paperwork. However the job must get done. I usually work 11 hours a day, and the least is 7 hours a day."
good,"The Rent A Center I worked for was a franchise. So I wouldn’t know what the life was like dealing with corporate. The only thing I enjoyed about the job was being able to drive, do runs, deliver furniture/pick-up. I enjoyed working with my credit manager. Everyone else 👎🏽 But that’s neither here or there. But I wouldn’t go back it’s a toxic work environment as far as my experience is concern"
good,Overall working at Rent A Center was an enjoyable experience. Toward the end it was very stressful as management. The trickle effect happened here. Problems are always blamed on the lower management. Pressure got to be too much. This was my last full time job. Stress became too much. I haven't worked for 10 years and I blame it mostly on the stress of this job.
good,Working for Rent-A-Center was very challenging. I was hired as collection specialist and was able to be promoted to Senior Account Manager. Leaving the field was one of the highlights of it.
good,Plenty of manual heavy lifting picking up an dropping off appliances electronics furniture an other home decor from home to home an store to store and also loading an unloading trucks an maintaining my work space and/or environment.
good,Your experience with the company will be based off where you work. But if you are in the right location with a great manager you will love it. You get to interact with different people. Everyday is something new and the freedom you have is great. The company benefits are great too
good,Rent A Center takes advantage of low income people in my opinion. So trying to collect was very hard they cant give you what they don't have and so that was one of the reasons why I left the company
good,"Work hard, play hard. When it came time to reward their employees they went above and beyond always offering great incentives. Also offered great medical benefits."
good,I am a very hard and dedicated worker for rent a center I really sharpened my skills which I thank them for. I would usually walk in do my round of calls trying to get my payments in for my accounts before the day is due. We had to maintain a certain percentage for every end of the week as to my understanding yet we learned sales how to greet customers and fulfill them with there needs whether it was a cell phone or a refrigerator it was delivered I always tried my best to make every delivery a success. on slow days we organize the store I used to clean the store making space in the back room for more inventory or returns from customers. I drove the box truck and the rent a center van either making deliveries or picking up over due  merchandise. I would say the hardest part of the job is bringing linebackers up to the third floor but as I said no job was impossible if done correctly. This job has taught me a lot about engaging with customers but on a more personal level actually remembering names and making sure each customer was highly satisfied.
good,It was a good place to work. The work load can be physically demanding and is not always evenly distributed among the staff. Compensation was adequate.
good,"6 day work week with everyone working open to close every day. The pressure to get sales no matter what and then hunt the merchandise down when the customer you pushed into the sale can't make the payments. Hundreds of collection calls to make every day. I was sent out to deliver large appliances and furniture up 3 floors by myself. I worked in 3 stores in my area and only 1 of them had a good manager that knew what they were doing. I was sent in to help clean up the mess in the others and it was a nightmare. The management from the district manager up are horrible to work with, setting impossible goals and expecting results in less than a day."
good,I enjoyed working at rent a center it was one of my first jobs it was good start and I gained experience from seeing and doing different things around the store
good,Mandatory 8 Hr per week is too much. No work life balance. Must work all holidays. Needs to become more employee focused. Employees get burnt out and company doesn't really care.
good,"I had seen several changes over the years, some good, some bad but overall it was a good company to work for. I really liked helping the customers and watching their families grow up. I wore many hats here but it was a sales and collection business."
good,You work alot I mean alot 9am to 7pm Monday through Saturday 9am to 6pm... you never get Saturdays off only if you switch your days off  you never have two days off in a row  Sundays they're closed have certain holidays paid time off.
good,A typical day at Rent a Center is very fast paced and loud. I learned how to collect money from a different type of clientele being instructed by the store manager and listening. The store manager is an awesome manager. The work place culture was at times difficult. The hardest part of the job was driving; covering up to three hundred miles a day going from house to house trying to collect past due payments. Not to mention; it was dangerous. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know the customers and learning great skills from the store manager in retail management.
good,My opinion of the company would be it's a fast pace competitive environment we're at sometimes you don't have time just to think so you have to be very cautious of going in these type of jobs because they can also monopolize your mental availability even off of work
good,It is a ok place to work if you have the co workeres that will back you. You have to stay to yourself do what is excepted of you. There is many opportunities for advacement
good,"Company was good to work for till ceo changed. Company was sold and as we know will be closing down stores"
good,Every store location is different and every staff are different. Some days it was fun to work there especially when collection and sale numbers were good. When those numbers aren’t being met it can and will get stressful. Sales and collections aren’t easy to come by especially with all the other cheaper options out there. Working sometimes with bugs like roaches bed bugs ants spiders and even rodents. Work long hours never home and the pay isn’t great for you not to be home with your family. Can be dangerous depending on what location you work. Have to go to sketchy areas and knock on customers doors for payments or merchandise. Great job for a single person with no responsibilities.
good,As a store manager i am required to work 50+ hours a week . Must work every Saturday! Company expectations are unrealistic especially living in a small unpopulated town.
good,Not a job for everyone. Collections can be very challenging. You need be very patient and forgiving. Long days and very seldom will you ever get 2 days of because of the company's scheduling policy.
good,Weekly pay. Demanding work schedule. Good benefits. Turnover of staff and management is very high. Rules and regulations are not consistent.  Its ok to do one thing today and be wrong the next.
good,"As a manager you are responsible for the success of the store and get little credit for that success. Staff is not loyal and plot to take your position. Other stores compete for your customers. Low pay and managers make about 40,000 a year."
good,Id clock in talk to my team check whats the task today and load up my truck. We check to make sure we had all the correct items for our drop offs so we would't have to make two trips or upset the buyer.
good,"prefer not too at this time. if needed to in person, would be willing to at that time. Although the company has given families in need a chance for a fresh start"
good,"I started with the company as a driver, i worked my way up with my work ethic and need to learn. I always worked long hours but i didn't mind it because i had nothing else to do. Fast forward 2 years, I'm in a relationship but I feel like with the lack of a work life balance, I cannot actually have a relationship. I see my coworkers more than i do my own girlfriend. Not to mention they will NOT give you 2 consecutive days off, only a Sunday which the entirety of the company is closed and either a Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday."
good,"rent a center was a horrible job,  my manager was a awesome person but for the most part not a great experience . full of uneducated staff ..........."
good,Great company to work for but I am looking for something new. I have been doing Rent to own for over 17 years and  I am ready to take on new challenge.
good,"Limited opportunities to grow and advance in this company and environment.  Organization structure was lacking.  However, the immediate manager was top notch."
good,Love the job itself with helping customers get the things they need and setting up merchandise and hitting goals. The downside is the high turnover because of constantly revolving new leadership who want to change things and push employees out the door.
good,picture this you go into work only to meet a spiteful glare being told you don't understand your job even though you consistently are in top 5 in the district that's my Rent A Center not all of them but mine we have the lowest moral employees all have something against each other for trivial and spiteful reason and no amount of optimism can fix I I`ve been to other Rent-A-Centers and the atmosphere is completely different so it all depends where you land it may be a great of horrible experience based on your coworkers
good,Ok job would like better time management. Hard work with lefting things and delivery to people houses. Physical and draining work if your into workout then this the job for you.
good,I would not recommend Rent A Center to anyone with a family. The hours are long very little time with family. But all in all I like the daily challenges and fast pace.
good,"Daily SOP changes"
good,Competitive wages but long hours and very physical work. Staff in stores are easy to get along with but not the same when it comes to upper management.
good,"Typical day at work is to follow-up with all stores on a daily basis while coaching/teaching coworkers in our High 5 Processes.  Customer Service is High Priority.  I have learned quite a bit as a District Manager.  I received different perspectives from stores on a daily basis. Hardest part of the job is driving to and from work. I live in Mechanicsburg, PA to Baltimore, MD on a daily basis.  I love the interaction with customers as well as the coworkers.  Love to teach and train."
good,My typical day as a sales manager was preparation for the showroom floor. I cleaned and maintained tags on all merchandise on showroom floor.Training account managers on sales and techniques. Typing rental agreements with customers and performed sales calls or promotions with following-up customer feedback.
good,"The pay is descent and you get paid every Friday but their is not a work life balance. It's all about collections and sales and if you don't reach your collection goals you will have to work on your off day and could be demoted and or terminated if that continues. I miss the money but the employees are not professional, they are jealous hearted and ghetto. When the old regional tried to change the culture the older employees felt threatened like we were there to take their jobs so it was a mess. No team work a great deal of backstabbing and negativity. Forget family time that won't happen if your credit is not where Rent A Center wants it to be."
good,"Working at Rent-A-Center was alright. You had set hours, but would always go overtime. When you go overtime, they would cut your hours. For example, if you went overtime one day, they would tell you to either stay home or go into work at a later time the next day."
good,"Rent-A-Center was a good learning experience; however, I had left the company due to me leaving to pursue my Bachelors Degree. This job is meant for strong and fast paced individuals such as those who can lift over 70 pounds. They paid excellent, but to me pay did not matter to me due to the fact that Rent-A-Center was just a temporary job and it had no relation to my degree. Also, the customers were a handful and very rude and demanding."
good,"rent a center , could use a few improvement's to make each store more enjoyable. was understaff, need to be allowed to work over time to give all employees  time to perform all duties correctly"
good,"During my time here at RAC, everything started OK.   Tenure in the company didn't seem to matter when it come down to candidates for advancement.  The crew I worked with was excellent, but no chance for advancement."
good,"A little bit of everything. You can learn and communicate with the customers, you build rapport and friendships. Customers tell you about their life. Its a big chain store with small and pops feel to it."
good,"Lots of favoritism, and if your not one they ask to hang out with after hours, you can pretty well assume your not going to get promoted very quickly."
good,My day typically began between 830 and 9am and ended between 7 and 730pm.   I would print the daily paperwork and go over the goals for the previous day and the current day.  Take care of customers as they call or stop into the store.  I never had an issue with any of my managers and the small staff made for a very relaxed atmosphere.
good,"Very fast paced, competitive company. Can be rewarding if you apply yourself to conform to large constantly changing industry. physically and mentally draining at times."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Rent A Center I made a salary and was able to create additional income with the bonus structure. I was able to bring this location from 350 units on rent when I took the store over in 2010 to over 700 units on rent growing the store into the Million Dollar Club by 2015. "
good,"While being employed, one minute you're praised for the excelling in sales, customer growth, and revenue improvement.  However,  that quickly changes."
good,Rent A Center is a good company to work for and offers products to customers on a rent to own basis that they might not be able to enjoy otherwise. Although the company helps folks out with payment plans they are over priced in relation to their full term pricing structure.
good,i really think rent a center is unprofessional and only think there employees are robots that is all....................................................
good,"Daily you sales,payroll and training and setup store and displays and help customers to reach sales goals daily and weekly and monthly. The day also involves calling collections."
good,What I like most about the job is I get to meet all types of people with different cultures.Also i get to drive to people homes and deliver what they have purchased from the store.
good,"Looked out for those who was already in the company. Things can run very smooth as long as you have a good management team. Make sure you stay on top of your calls in the morning, so later on your day will be a lot easier."
good,"alot of calling and knocking on doors"
good,"A typical day usually starts at 8 a.m. You would come in and start your safe and prepare your deposit. You make calls to past due customers and remind them of their payments. You greet every customer that comes in and try to provide 100% great customer service. I have learned great management skills from this company, and how to be a team player. The culture is diversified as you have many different types of people everyday. The hardest part is the long hours and not being able to enjoy quality time with your family. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with my customers, they are very nice and personable and make it worth while coming in to work everyday."
good,"nothing to tell ,this company didn't treat its employees fair but over all paid pretty good ,very relaxed and allowed you to meet with different people on a daily basis"
good,deliver pick up furniture write up agreements run credit make phone calls take payments only if they like you will you be able to advance but you get to work with customers
good,Requires too much of your life. Felt like I was taking advantage of customers. Didn't have a work life mix. Had to work 6 days a week 7am to 7pm. Not the best job.
good,"Very busy and stressful business, there is zero work life balance.  You are often called on your day off.  Days off are split and if not performing well you are forced to work one day off."
good,very fast paced and they only care about the companies numbers more than employees long hours not enough pay and deliveries can be to much and not enough people to help
good,"I like the managers we had, friendly but no to helpful. Job got hard at times, alot of angry customers because if they didn't pay we had to repo their stuff."
good,A typical day at work ranges from nine to ten hours. Basic furniture delivery and reposition. Here I learned a job can make you question your own morals. Great pay and benefits but at the cost of being degraded by management constantly and having almost no chain of command to turn to for help. the team I worked with under management was absolutely amazing and was the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,"Overall the compensation and benifits of this company are good. During my employment here I have acquired many different skills in different areas. I can utilize these skills to seek another and better career opportunity. Poor upper level management as they are consistently changing policies. No work/life balance.if your store doesn't hit number upper management requires employees and store manage to stay late and consistently call past due customers. Many times they force us to call over three times daily and past eight PM. If stores hit their numbers in hopes of going home on time, district managers still hold employees 2-3 hours past scheduled clock out times especially on Saturdays."
good,"Though there were very limited opportunities for challenge and/or advancement, the role itself gave me the stable, professional experience I needed in order to begin building my career's foundation."
good,"A fun atmosphere and group of people whom in which jell together well in personality, work ethics and all around beneficial for the work production. Little room to grow with the company. Management doesn't maximize potential in self nor for those who make the company thrive."
good,"busy work environment keeps you interested, but very poor management. upper management cleaned out all experienced staff making it impossible to run a successful business."
good,"Each day's work load depends on our customers and availability of merchandise. its not a job that overwhelms you but you definitely got to be into lifting furniture up 6 floors at times lol..not really my thing. Learned a few things,...my area is predominantley hispanics so my spanish is up, and thats one of the good parts of my job."
good,A typical work a day is clocking in and providing a service that meet or exceeds customer expectations in regards to instant home improvement. Some days you deliever and install merhcandise brought from the customer or you my repair or service merchandise that has already been rented.
good,"I really wasn't happy at this job honestly, the work/life balance just wasn't there, due to the long unpredictable hours. Some days might be 16 hours which leaves little for a balance. However I did love my co-workers, and the customers."
good,I would spend my mornings calling people who are late on their account. Then load my truck for deliveries. Come back later on like around 6 o'clock.Unload truck and get prepared for the next day.
good,"It's a laid back job, it can be boring. Coworkers were great though! Days feel long. Make about 100 calls a day to people who just hang up on you."
good,"N/A. I choose not to make any comments. Like any job, you have the good and the bad. My only advice is not to get into management."
good,OK place to work if you are looking to make ok money but not a good place to work at if you are trying to move up the corporate latter
good,Rent-A-Center was not a horrible job but it was not a good job either. working with some of the coworkers I had was not all that great and the DM was always on you about something you did wrong and never gave you any gratitude for what you did right. the customers were great if you were on their good side but once you were on their bad side a great day could be turned into an awful day in a matter of minutes.
good,Great co-workers but you do not have much of a personal life. You work from morning to night and work 6 days a week. Your damaging your body lifting furniture all day for $11 dollars an hour.
good,"Show up make around 300 calls in the am, go run past due account and try and collect money/merch. Make deliveries, along with set up of merch. take an hour lunch, come back to the store to make another 300 calls and then do a pm run of past due accounts"
good,"typical day starts at 8:30am run around turn everything on make sure store looks great,open the safe get the money ready for the bank,check email,print reports,have coworker verify deposit,go to the bank,open the store,start collection calls and sales calls,then get ready for road work, start loading deliveries,go on first delivery then start lunch breaks,take care of customers as they come in.hardest part of the job is having to pick up merchandise from a customer that has been with you for a very long time and has ran out of options,the most enjoyable part is when they get to make the last payment on the item and get ownership of it,I've learned to understand that sometimes people may act a certain way because they are having a bad day and has nothing to do with us, to look for the strengths of my coworkers to help them be more successful at what they do."
good,"Love dealing with the customer, but hate the long hours away from my family. This company is made for the young single, with no kids."
good,The balance of high sales numbers on credit to a clientele with bad credit proved for a challenging job. Risks must be taken and any risk that went wrong created a lot more work.
good,I loved working with the team at the store and making deliveries and getting to know many different people and being able to help them out.
good,"would not recommend to anyone the co workers were the best part of the job. The hardest part of the job is repoing merchandise, going to peoples houses to get them to pay, and all the lifting all day."
good,"• Start off cool and varied as the schedule went on ruff at times but maintainable."
good,When I at Rent a Center. I had to make sure I check the board for deliveries for customer and make service everything ids done on time
good,"Collection calls sales, team work, deilveries pick up. Its a fun job if you make it fun. It depends on the team that you work with as well. There is a huge turn over rate."
good,"A typical day is making collections and marketing calls, taking payments, and trying to sign deals. A lot of down time because the store traffic,meaning if you're caught up there's really nothing to do."
good,"I managed the largest company loan volume in the country that consistently met and exceeded company expectations.  I learned time management, handled a lot of financial transactions, how to supervisor employees, and sales practices.  The customer base could be very difficult and company demands were very strong.  Growing and managing loan delinquency proved to be challenging yet welcomed.  I really enjoyed building relationships with the customer base and being challenged on a professional level."
good,"Had to call all customers past due first; make bank deposit, take deposit to the bank. Load up first delivery on truck or sometimes had to go get items from other stores.  "
good,"When I first started RAC I enjoyed it. However I was single and young. Once I had a family it took alot of family time away and everything I did rotated around RAC. Coming in on your one day off and on salary, being told if you didn't come in you didn't care and therefore was looked down on. At the later part of my employment when district managers changed, is when I really wanted to leave and did not even want to come to work any longer. The DM for disctrict 153 in 2012 was not quite the DM I looked up to, as all she did was down all of her employees and threaten them on a daily basis that she could fire them and to top it off with her foul launguage and inappropriate remarks."
good,"I would start by opening up the store and reviewing the days schedule. I would go out on deliveries and then go visit companies. when I was in the store I would help customers in the store and over the phone. I would also make sure our floor was looking great and clean. I then would count down the till and close up the store."
good,"Versatile Manager focused on team building and talent development. Driven to surpass company goals while thriving in deadline-driven environments. Possessing in-depth knowledge of collections, as well as advanced understanding of sales. Personable and friendly with superb negotiation and presentation skills."
good,"Its a hard work enviroment. There are many good employes but not such a good management. In two years I see more than five co-workers get fired, offended and discriminated by the management."
good,I have learned a whole lot more about how the business run and what it takes to make things fit for people in the community.
good,"I've learned a great deal from Rent-A-Center like how to be a great collector. A typical day at work would consist of collection calls/home visit that at times turn into on-spot repossessions. Delivery, pick up and maintenance of furniture, electronics/computers, appliances."
good,"all ways overtime, no help for pick ups and prone to injuries"
good,"Typical day we start by having a morning meeting going over any details or future upcoming events, we review what deliveries we have for the day and prepare accordingly."
good,A good company to work for if you like not having a life or being chastised for wanting one. No matter how hard you try and do your job its never good enough for upper management. Customers and in store employees are the best part of the day. Just don't plan on having company support your back in any way shape of form
good,If your not afraid of hard work and longs hours this could be the job for you.
good,Assisting customers with their payments and questions on potential sales is an everyday experience at Rent A Center.  I have learned that there are different customer bases out there and not just one. A customer is a customer no matter where they live. I'm a manger of 4 coworkers not including myself. The hardest part of the job is time management with 4 people and taking care of every customer at their request. The most enjoyable part is coming to work and being with all my coworkers. We like family since we see each other daily.
good,"Daily tasks included sales, customer service, collection activities, and deliveries. Management was firm but the co-workers are usually easy-going. Hardest part of the job is the collection part. Tracking stolen merchandise and calling references. Most enjoyable part of the job is closing a hard account."
good,Being the Collection Manager I would structure a game plan to generate results in acquiring payment from past due customers. I'd make phone calls to customers that accounts were considered delinquent. I learned how to communicate and adapt to different personalities at Rent A Center. I learned how to problem solve and and I became a very willing decision maker. I've learned not only how to sell product but convince a potential buyer to purchase. The hardest part of the job was having to stand my ground for things I didn't believe in at times. The most enjoyable part of the job was handling customer problems and leaving them with the security of knowing I care about their issues and will go beyond the call of duty to handle them accordingly.
good,"Long hours, no weekend time for family. Good place to work if you like working with the public."
good,Retrieved customer payments from sales. Delivered and installed furniture and home appliances.
good,"a typical day at work will consist of delivering furniture in all weather conditions, build and repair merchandise , door to door collections, setting up furniture and doing inventory, loading and unloading trucks."
good,"The day started with collection calls and scheduling pickups. Prepared merchandise for deliveries. "
good,"A typical day at work would be very hectic involving everything that you can see on my resume. "
good,"management was a little off with the higher ups, most enjoyable part of the job is being able to have a fun but very productive day at work. Typical day consists of delivery driving and calls."
good,"Worked an average of 65 hours a week."
good,rent a center is not a place for someone who is still trying to go back to school. it takes up to much of your personal time and and not enough pay
good,"A typical day at work consists of calling people who are passed due 3 times a day to bring in or call in payments. You also have to telemarket and add-on to sales to achieve weekly sales quotes. There are hundreds of accounts and you work with each customer to maximize revenue and minimize returns and losses. Updates to P/L statements is performed on a daily basis. Control and manage inventory. You stock the floor in according to all current promotions and maximize inventory visibility with space limitations. Also, coaching and counseling of all store personnel."
good,Overall RAC was a fun enviornment you have to work and get along with customers to meet goals for sales and repayment.
good,"A typical day you would do daily paper work. Take care of customers, selling items or making renew payments. Cleaning and putting together merchandise. I learned patience and dealing with all kinds of people. Had good relationships with co-workers. The most enjoyable part of my job was my customers and co-workers. I enjoyed the people, even if they were upset about something. I like solving problems."
good,"typical day was making 100 plus phone calls, working on collections, refurbishing used merchandise, delivery and set up of merchandise included electronics, appliances, furniture. coworkers at my store only seemed to work hard enough to not get fired which made it harder on everybody who did work hard. decent paychecks due to 8 to 10 hours of overtime everyweek."
good,Pay is good but the hours are very long. You spend a lot of time delivering merchandise and calling accounts about payments
good,The job was great but stressfull. It also required you to work very long hours.
good,"Rent A Center is a decent company; however the working hours are extremely long.The company offers good benefit packages to its managers, and there is substantial opportunity for growth."
good,it was very busy and hard work alot of hrs not alot of home time
good,rent a center was a good job. the hours are long but it is a fun place to work. you do lots of stuff every day and never have the same day twice. biggest problem is the irrational desire by upper managemtn to hit goals that are unattainable. and if you attain such goals they raise them until u cant then get rid of you
good,"Great place to work. Very adventurous job, you pretty much have to renew your efforts on a daily basis."
good,"Made cold calls and reminder calls to clients. Promoted sales, kept all accounts updated and filed. Delivered furniture. Answered phones, assisted management, and took payment in person and over the phone. The management needed improvement. They were disorganized and lacked the drive to create a higher clientelle."
good,handled money customer service 8-12 hour days 6 days a week service calls
good,"This job consumes your whole life. Pay could be better, and like most places, getting promoted is more about politics than actual knowledge, experience, and skills."
good,extremely disorganized and backwards system to function. Promotional opportunities are there if you want them.
good,"Balanced, difficulty trying to deal with the manager. Didn't show any courtesy regarding the associates."
good,collection calls in morning deliveres in afternoon and sales in between all the work
good,My days were always about managing our credit numbers. Making phone calls and advising/counseling customers daily about delinquent accounts. Half the time I was out on the road making field visits to either assist customers with product issues or to council them on their accounts.
good,"If you're a man, this is a great place for you, however as a woman, things are tough. Management and corporate treats all equally so to speak, however it is difficult for a woman to advance in the company without the gossip, rumors and resentment."
good,"Working for Rent-A-Center was a good experience for me and often got me outside of my comfort zone. My daily routine consisted of making collection calls for about 3 hours in the morning, making sure sales floor was presentable, meeting sales goals, making deliveries and setting up merchandise, Repossessing merchendise from delinquent accounts."
good,I learned alot working in the rent to own business. Sometimes the hardest part of the job is dealing with upset customers but you'll learn alot about people through those situations.
good,"clean up from day before, make phone calls, sale merch, deliver merch, more calls, unload delivery truck, pick up merch from customers who didnt pay."
good,Hours are long and extended and it’s hard to keep a work life balance here. Employer also makes it difficult to do things outside of work. Often times you feel intimidated about using time off.
good,In stead of customers put reviews in for you they have us asking the customer to put reviews. If we don't ask our customers we can be considered not doing our job.
good,I was a customer account rep  i had the responsibility of handling all accounts. Everyday i was responsible for calling all pass due customers and collecting and taking payments.  Also responsible for going out in the field and retrieving merchandise that has fell to far behind in payments
good,"As a deliver driver I remember picking up furniture from several families weeks after delivering it to them based on their financial needs which was mostly consensual. occasionally we would have to deal with hostile customers who rented electronics and simply refused to pay for months in an attempt to obtain the companies property back. "
good,"Good company and helps people get quality merchandise. The stuff in this company, management and upper management are not to be trusted and they will throw you under the bus in a heart bit in order to keep their job. Customer focus they say,  but they force you to add costs on their payment and if you don't you are out! You have no quality time with your family."
good,I did enjoy some of the work I did because it was making the customer happy. Overall though I would rather not work at another one of these companies due to my experience with this branch.
good,"Delivering for Rent-A-Center wasn’t hard, but the pay was not enough for the task. If the salary matched the task the job wouldn’t be bad at all, for sure."
good,Corporate is better than retail location..not as much appreciation or compensation for the field employees as corporate employees. Not a good place for upward advancement either
good,"I went from an individual contributor to an IT leader within 4 years during a time when the business was struggling and positioned to sell and the network was undergoing digital transformation. The business turned around, didn't sell, acquired a new entity and is positioned for positive growth into the future. I enjoyed the people I worked with and the challenges the environment presented."
good,"The company offers really great benefits, but your experience will be largely determined by your store manager and district manager. They promote from within, but it is very highly competitive. Depending on your management, you could be expected to work overtime to meet quotas and goals."
good,We worked in a great department but company was very directed toward maintaining and beating sales goals that were a lot of the time not achievable. Position was eliminated.
good,I was a part time employee at RAC and was able to spend a lot of time outside of work. I was able to learn many useful skills that I still use to this day.
good,"Learned alot of good things from my coworkers but management there is the worst, very toxic store manager. I don't let that be an obstacle and ruin my happiness though."
good,"Working there was not difficult to do, on a typical day I would arrive at work we would have our usual group meeting, and some of us would alternate what they called RUNS where you go to the customer's house to collect their payment if they've been late. And that only happened if we were not able to reach them other the phone. Next, we had to make calls where we called current customers to collect payment over the phone. Also, we worked on the sales floor and tried to close sales on furniture. The only downside of this job was the hours sometimes we would leave the store late at 10 p.m. or 11 p.m."
good,For most part on coworkers working together was good and things were able to get done just store management was pretty bad something I wouldn't go back to.
good,I believe RAC doesn't train their employees enough. The company doesn't put their employees in the best situations for success. I've seen employees stray away from enforcing company policy. Dress code is not consistent nor is their professional conduct.
good,regional managers changed every year over my tenure. made things very difficult from a culture and consistency aspect. changes in CEO and vision also made things tough in the field. sold many stores to franchisee and my are fell victim.
good,"I worked pretty much from 830-730 every day besides Wednesday's and Sundays. I'd come in each day and get out my safe. Print out reports to review the previous days performance. Then look at my schedule for the day to ensure it was layed out properly. Once my guys got to work I'd have someone prepare the bank deposit then we would immediately start on past due calls. Once calls were done one person would go to the bank and I'd have my delivery guys prep and load the truck for our first delivery and I'd have my assistant do task specific to their title. So my sales manager would approve order forms for clients who needed approved, or my credit assistant would prepare collection runs that needed done throughout the day. From 11-1pm everyone would get a lunch and the day would begin. I'd deal with walk in sales throughout the day as well as web orders. The phone would ring a lot and the objection was to hit a sales goal that was expected daily as well as hit a credit expectation meaning having a only a certain amount of past due clients by the end of the day. This was the main goal for our business. I learned how to deal with people on such an intimate level and built very strong relationships with people. I learned how to build rapport with my employee's but also earn their respect. I learned after 7-8 years of being a manager how to properly motivate people. I created a work culture and was able to motivate my guys to try and get to my position one day via my own experiences and success's with the company. The hardest thing for me had to be 830-730 and working on saturday's for"
good,This job provided a lot of opportunities form customers who didn't have good credit to obtain the products they needed for their families.  Nom credit needed was the logo.
good,Fun place to work. Advancement is slow. Company is moving towards franchising and it’s unknown when all of the stores will be sold. Not sure what I’m having to
good,Nothing directly bad to say Management & team atmosphere is fine depending on how realistic your district manager is for some odd reason structure is missing when comes to accountability but none the less rent to own business at rent a center Will certainly be a trying experience for anyone .
good,"Be ready to work long hours for a company that acts like they care for you, but in return care nothing for you, but the bottom line. The company seeks to make people go further in debt by over charging customers for items."
good,"A good place to work, better if you're single. 8:30-7:30 5 days a week is rough. Work/life balance is tough to manage. Upper management expects the same results no matter the location which is hard to maintain."
good,"If you can handle long hours, for good pay, coupled with a lot of stress, this is the place for you. And that's after you've learned the ropes and managed a store or two."
good,"Management was the main reason for me leaving Rent-A-Center. If there was more structure, balance and more team oriented people the worked in the building, my time there would have been better."
good,Rac used to be a great company to work for but has changed a lot. Pay structure sill the same from over 15 years. Bonus structure is no good about 6 stores bonus per region and that’s like 75 stores and some only $300 a month. But home office continues to grow but field doesn’t. They’re still stuck in their old ways and not adapting
good,"Unfortunately, changing competitive climate and recent changes in company leadership/structure have turned this company into a non-ideal place to work."
good,"On the whole, the work environment was standard, i loved my boss, but the work was very labor intensive and for my role in the company as a CAR... the customers hated me. it was my job to collect on past due accounts, so the customers i got to know where the delinquent and hard margin customers. from dealing with pest problem, rancid appliances, and down right life threatening at times, it got to be very mentally taxing... I spent most of my days driving around on the truck, and knocking on doors... it got to be very depressing that no one ever wanted to see me, and at times, when customers i felt sorry for were in need of understanding, the corporate atmosphere did not allow for compassion. my boss did what he could to help, but sometimes his hands were tied because he has a boss too after all is said and done. Not a job for the weak willed or compassionate of heart, but if taking a crying child's bed away from them doesn't bother you, by all mean... you will do well in this position with this company."
good,"Under paid, wouldn't allow to advance. Job can be extremely  stressful and you can get into some very stressful situations with customers. Should pay more for what you have to go through."
good,Days are long and nerve wrecking. Must be able to deal with many different personalities and perform at a high level. This job requires you have positive attitude and a smile on your face at all times. Regardless of the situation.
good,I have worked for RAC for over 7 years and I have seen a lot of great people come and go. The pay was great but what you did every week was extremely taxing on you do to long hours and management literally breathing down your back. (I know because I was made to do it as a manager) You do have a chance for advancement but you have to be a serious go getter and have the ability to move frequently. Not family friendly. Something for just out of college or someone who doesn't need at home time.
good,"Rent a Center is a good job for delivery drivers. Good, fair work, and reasonable pay. If you are looking to get experience in driving jobs, this will be great."
good,This job had a better environment than most. The customers were cool and so were my co-workers. But they hound you on making sales...sometimes people just don't want it
good,"aprendí las rutas, me encargaba de tareas como chofer repartidor a diversas colonias, también fui motociclista certificado"
good,"good place to learn skills, hours were long and pay was ok. manangement expected more than could be done in the collection department. otherwise its an ok place to work"
good,"My office is currently very understaffed due to our manager's toxic behavior, shady business practices, and abusive treatment of employees who will not stand up to her."
good,"Great place to start out and learn some skills. It can be stressful at times, especially with high turnover. There are a variety of roles at RAC that can provide good skill development to take to another job."
good,"I enjoyed my time with the company, awesome manager and director. There is practically no strategic vision,  which resulted in the massive layoff last week. A lot of good people lost their jobs that day, it didn't matter if you gave your all to the company or not, basically all the employees were viewed by C level management as a line item on a spreadsheet. I have been in the corporate world for many years and I have never heard so many ""I don't know's"" coming from the C-levels in meetings. The CIO, while he is a nice guy, isn't technical at all. This company is in trouble, the only hope for it, is that someone buys it that has leadership skills."
good,"Arrive one hour before scheduled employees to balance books and make bank deposit as well as phone calls with other managers concerning productivity. I learned to manage a payroll cash advance as well as store management all in one. Culture was competitive, hardest part of job was managing two businesses in one and most enjoyable part of the job was working closely with employees."
good,report to work 9:am plan day out go to bank for deposit.call past due accounts.meet with coworkers to discuss goals for the day.i love my customers.three past due calls per day to much calling.
good,a typical day at rent a center would be stressful district manager would call streaming at the store manager about sales and goals. if we didn't make the quota he would call abt half hour before closing and say we had to stay there for another hour or go & pick up delinquent customers' merchandise
good,"You would start out as an account manager. These people make ""reminder calls"" about past due payments every morning and evening.  In between you will be delivering and picking up furniture. If you get promoted into management you will do less lifting and more persuading people to pay past due balances. This is done in person."
good,"When things are running smoothly, meaning that your sales and collections are in line for the most part, the job is not that bad. As of recent, though, I unfortunately found myself working an excessive amount of hours because 2 employees quit, and with such a small retail operation, 2 employees makes a huge difference. The most frustrating part is the lack of empathy and help from higher management. There is a distinct lack of care with this employer sometimes, and regardless of how many people you may be down, the attitude is always ""get the job done, and offer no excuse."" The joke among all store managers is concerning the stated goals of the company to improve the quality of life for all of its coworkers, unless you're the store manager. Then, you're screwed."
good,Follow up with stores on yesterday's sales and collection performance and set goals for the day. Completed store audits follow up on training. Management is fair. Job is not hard but challenging in all areas. Helping customers improve their quality of life by getting to   ownership of the merchandise.
good,The management at Rent A Center is uncoordinated and lazy. The only way to get raises and bonuses is to just work there for a while. The benefits were nice but there was little reason to stay because of the people working in other Rent A Center stores.
good,"loading and unloading trucks. Delivery of household goods. It was a good place to work, I had fun working with certain people and working with management in the office."
good,"Job was a great place to meet new people and help them out with becoming a better person within money management. I became more developed as a person and learned to become sensitive about the needs of other. This job gave a little more insight on inventory, delivery, and time management."
good,"long hours, constant yelling from management, don't ever get sick and always have documentation even if your 5 minutes late... All they cares about are numbers"
good,"When I first became employed at rent a Center, I began at the corporate office in Plano,TX. I loved my co- workers. Very helpful and understanding that I was once in the education field. I am a quick learner as my staff saw and was soon put in charge of various areas of the payroll process.  I have now transitioned  to the RAC Field. It has been stressful from the get go. Coming from an education background where you look for positives in a person even if it is very minimal.  Self-esteem is very important for an employee.  My manager has been very positive, but our District Manager has a hard time finding that sense of positive for his employees. I would not recommend this person for any promotion that might be forthcoming for him."
good,"Sales, collection routes, rental delivery, take payments on customer accounts, set up showroom inventory, repossess merchandise from customers, charge customers 51% interest on rental items."
good,"I worked for the company for over 10 years.  In that time you are required to not only do the rent to own side covering contracts, but you are also required to deliver or pick up the merchandise if not paid for.  Do field visits to customers homes if merchandise is not paid for, and up to 600 calls per day trying to collect money on unpaid contracts.  Stores were required to meet credit standards every week and if they were not reached you would be written up, had to work until 9pm, 2 hours after the store closed, or be told that they can find someone else that can do your job for a lot less than what they are paying you."
good,It is a retail job so you'll be working like you would if you worked for any other major retailer. Long hours around the holidays but you do make time and a half which is good. Enjoyed my time there for the most part
good,Renting furniture was not fun especially when you have to go an repo furniture back from a customer ...it was hard some days doing that I knew this wasn't for me
good,Because the rent a center company is a physical lebor employer working smarter is always better than harder. Problem solving will be daily but maintaining company standards with high customer service satisfaction can cause issues.
good,"Rent A Center is a good company, it just wasn't for me. Sales are very demanding, and you have to make sure the company is generating money through sells."
good,Learned a lot at this job. I called customers that was late on they payment. I did some delivery and pick ups. The hardest part was trying to get customers that was real late to pay or give up our merchandise.
good,Great work environment. The only reason that I left the company is that there were three different owners of that particular franchise. Their opinions varied so much that it was impossible to be successful in their eyes.
good,RentaCenter has been a good place to work for these last 10 years.  It can definitely be a career for some.  You have to be willing to work hard and deal with the stress and long hours.
good,"Rent A Center is a high paced environment. Requiring a lot of different training that involves sales, collections, and store operations for all employees. Team based culture is mandatory RAC isn't a business that can be successfully operated without the entire staff working together."
good,RentACenter is a very stressful job because your job is based off of whether or not customers pay their bills on time or whether or not you grow your business with sales.
good,"I worked as a Delivery Driver.  It was new to me.  I was used to fast paced stocking.  Working for RAC was an experience I enjoyed.  Delivering items was good, except you never knew what to expect going into a persons home.  The bad part was people who stopped paying on product, we were sent to their homes by management to pick up the items.  I'm a fairly nice person so having to go to someone's home who stopped paying to get RAC merchandise was rough on me."
good,"Overall RAC has a unique business model that is struggling and  under strong financial pressures.  Focus is on revenue generating projects and the company is in extreme cost cutting mode."
good,"To many changes on a daily base , cero inventory control , poor culture follow up by team members , poor recruiting system .operation system do not work properly"
good,"was a temporary solution to a long term problem, loved the crew I worked with but the overall job was not fun.. numerous times I had to take children's beds since the parents wouldn't give up the television instead."
good,A place where you can advance quickly.  Also be a fast learner and like working with the public. It helps to also understand the needs and desires of your customers. How you treat them determines theyre long time loyalty.
good,"When you join this company you are expected to give 100% of yourself to it.  Very limited work/life balance.  Very consistently I would have to work over-time to make sure that my location ""hit its numbers"" for the month."
good,"Mandatory overtime"
good,"Great place to work if you have the right management. Will always promote from within the company, great benefits. The customers a great for the most part but patients is needed for others."
good,"At first the job was everything I thought it would be, but as time passed I learned first hand that lying was a way of life for them and treating their employees fairly did not ever happen.  The only part I liked about the job was the pay...Other than that I hated the job."
good,Not a very rewarding job considering your taking peoples furniture and calling twice a day if their account is past due. Work every day but Sundays and most holidays you are expected to work missing much of family time or school events.Has decent benefits and pay is ok.
good,Enjoyed working for this company and the people I worked with even though I had days were I would be doing deliveries alone which was hard on me but all in all it was a good job
good,"Loved working for rent a center. You get to learn a lot of different skills such as repossession, collections, sales, marketing, and cleaning! Beware it is still retail and now you will be working for people who already can't afford what your sellin em."
good,"Working for Rent-A-Center offered me challenges every day. The money for the position was ok. It required a lot of heavy lifting and driving. My positon was CAR. This is Customer Account Representative. When delivering to our customers we were working on customer accounts and store maintenance. There was never really any time to not be doing something."
good,I clocked in for work and analyzed the daily report for pickups and deliveries. I learned many ways to move massive appliances for being a small guy. Management was laid back until we needed to hurry up and finish before work ended. The environment was too relaxed most times. Needed more productivity. The hardest part was going on two man deliveries and pickups by yourself. I only weigh 150 lbs so picking up objects my size or bigger was a pain. The most enjoyable part was getting all the work finished in a timely manner throughout the day and not rushing because we did not have our priorities in order.
good,"I took this job after the real estate collapse and I was needing something steady. This job is good for what it is good for, but simply didnt offer me the income I desired. It is pretty entry level in my opinion."
good,"A  typical day included preparing for the day by checking delivery schedule and making sure that all materials and paperwork were accurate and loaded into delivery vehicle.  Making customer service calls through out the day.  As well as helping, handling, and dealing with customers in the store.  As the Asst. Manager I learned a lot about interactions with people and how to give the best customer service I can.  The management and work place culture are professional and busy.  The hardest part of the job was the hours 9-10 1/2 hrs. a day.  with 2 days off.  The most enjoyable part was the satisfaction I got when I was able to help someone that felt like no one could and them becoming repeat customers because of my professionalism and work ethic."
good,"Everyone thoughts about this company will differ but for me having a former RM and DM that poorly gave unrealistic goals trying to run each store as a primary sales but neglects everything else made things hard you had to push out a number of sales daily and weekly to suit their needs, credit was never given when due nor was respect. fortunately the company did replace them after i left and my former store is doing better with new RM's and DM's that came alone after i left"
good,"-looking at the books to see who paid their payments and who did not"
good,"I'd arrive to work and the first thing I'd do is call the customers who were past due on their payments, then go through the store and make sure it was showroom ready, check all e-mails, verify all deliveries and service calls for the day, conduct a brief morning meeting to ensure my team was on the same page, finally I'd open the doors and implement whatever sales plan/goals were agreed upon for that given week.  I learned how to balance employees as well as wear many hats and multi-task every minute of the work day.  The culture of the workplace was fun but balancing the credit and sales portion of the job made it difficult to achieve bonuses.  The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the smiles on many customers' faces after they receive an item that they wouldn't be able to afford at other retailers."
good,"The job is about what you woudl expect. It has high points, but mostly lows. It can be a very depressing job. Lots of heavy lifting and lots of negative cutsomer interactions"
good,Work/Life balance is terrible in the ANOW Division. Poor Communication causes a lot of confusion. No advancement unless willing to relocate. Policies change often leading to inconsistency in locations.
good,"typical day we called credit alot ,& helped people find and get what they wanted .Cleaned product ,set merchandise up on floor and did many sales calls"
good,"As a district manager my days started with looking at daily and weekly activities of 9 stores, lasting for around 2 hours while calling stores asking questions, looking for goals and giving direction. The week is usually 6 days Monday to Saturday, some late days depending on the drive that was sometimes 2 hours one way. Goals and reaching them for a desired effect, is the culture, planned financial growth, increasing the store customer base as well as maintaining and training the employees. The hardest part is getting consistency in all aspects of the business, the collection, and the growth, and making more profit. I truly enjoyed the people and training them for the next step up in the company."
good,You will need to be able to lift and carry furniture. You will learn to be sales savvy and enjoy helping people. It is a great experience to learn sales and entry level work.
good,"I would work to better the company and complete my tasks, however truck tags were expired and managers never told me so it went on my license which no employee anywhere should have to deal with.  Things were wrong or not functioning properly when, as a company, should have a checklist, and have these things taken care of."
good,it is a nice company to work for. I learned a lot with working for this company. Legal filing and making sure the customer has what they need to fit there needs.
good,"The culture of Rent-A-Center was good at the store level. Sometimes the drive to meet sales goals was too much coupled with delivering merchandise and managing accounts for past due payments. It should realistically have been the job of 2-3 people rather than 1, and from what I understand that aspect has changed somewhat since I have been employed there. The hours are consistent and the work is not difficult if you can deal with little things that come up such as nagging toward sales goals and some very dirty homes of customers."
good,"Just wish we wasn't always short staff, and are days were always over booked with delivery, the management was terrible she never hired the rite people, the work culture was good"
good,Easy to learn job but requires a lot of muscle. Management can be okay depending on the person. The people I work with were very nice and helpful when they help me transferring furniture from the store into a home or home to store.
good,"Decent working environment, time management is essential. Collections side can be very challenging people after all are not always willing to make payments and your numbers depend on them doing so. Sales side is easier, people come in usually with an idea of what they want, downside no commission!!!"
good,"Credit Manager for Rent-A-Center. Worked with customers explaining policy, procedure and rental laws. Collects on past due accounts and makes payment arrangements if needed. Collects personal information for customer to obtain credit with company. Complete and maintain records and reports. Work closely with Regional Manager to find ways to boost rental sales in the area. Evaluates information and documents to approve customers for rental credit. Calls and verifies customer references. Collection of payments and disbursement of cash."
good,"Good company to work for if you are single. Plenty of opportunity for advancement.  There is no quality of life as you eat, breathe,and sleep rent a center. Would probably have never left if there was a good work -life balance. Life is to short to pull 60+ hours a week. "
good,"Working at Rent-A-Center is no walk in the park.  It is a very challenging job atmosphere with roller coaster type dealings.  The hardest part of working there is dealing with management.  One week, you're the hero;  the very next week, they're looking for your replacement.  This job does teach you many things but I would not work there again."
good,Work was fine but the fact that there was never time for a lunch break also promising advancement and never giving me a shot but co-workers were good.
good,"Overall the actual job and its responsibilities were enjoyable. I was able to learn how collections and furniture delivery typically goes. However, the day to day was bogged down, by personal business that the manager and co-workers could not seem to leave at home. It was also unfortunate to see the use of somewhat questionable work methods."
good,"Tiene prestaciones superiors de Ley."
good,A typical work day is help customer's what want new items in there home. With out breaking the bank. The hardest part of the job is dealing with dishonest people.
good,Decent job closed Sunday slightly below average pay job can be frustrating at times long hours but 2 days off weekly 401 k vacation pay
good,"For me it was demanding and stressful.  Worked about 50 hours a week.   It had its ups and downs.  Pay was ok.  I wound up working late almost every day.   They push for sales, but sometimes it can be difficult to maintain your credit numbers.   Some times you had to chase down customers to get payment or merchandise back."
good,"Rac is an aggressive sales scene.  There are daily, weekly, monthly sales expectations for each individual.  On any given day you can see 10 sales or 0 sales.  The process of working the sales program is very detailed and must be followed to the letter."
good,No competitive pay. Business hours 9a- 6p Monday - Friday. Management was great but no team atmosphere. No room for professional growth.
good,"it was a fun place to work if the manager wasnt there, to much control and thought she was queen of the world. plus telemarketing people all day everyday didnt make the job fun"
good,"I was terminated after just a few months in position.  I have 9 years with the company and prior to my termination no written or verbal warnings.  "
good,I am all for a challenge but some of the goals set for the stores are a bit unrealistic. Store managers are off Wednesdays and everyone is off on Sundays because all the stores are closed.
good,"Busy from open to close, going to many different directions. not enough man power to accomplish the job expected back then and at my last store at least."
good,Rent-A-Center provides a high energy work environment to help serve the middle class U.S. It develops people skills but could use some improvement in the quality of life for their employees.
good,Daily work routine was consist of loading and delivering the merchandise as well as providing costumer service. Working here you will become pro at the assemble work overtime. Although some tough deliveries such as moving through tight spaces and doorways with heavy items can put a toll on your body it was very fun being on the road a majority of your work time..
good,"I had a good DM, you work 50 plus hours a week. Bad economy forced company to combine both stores. I would still be there with a better economy."
good,I enjoy working for Rent A Center; however there is very little family life outside work and the hours can be really long. The compensation could be a whole lot better as you are asked to do so much for very little.
good,"Day to day it can be hard but also easy, it really depends on everyone mood and determination of getting the work done. Hours are pretty good for part time employees and so is the pay."
good,Provide knowledge of brands to customers. Sell loyalist card to customers. Maintain appearance of sales floor. Team leads and management are usually there to work with you as you need. I enjoyed the customer relationships I built.
good,"Very great place to learn to become more then a team but like a family. However; The life outside of work is hard to juggle with the separated days off and long hours."
good,"Managed material movement and inventory, did collections and trained new hires. Interacted with the general public. The staff was small but overall everyone was pleasant with each other."
good,"Rent a center is a good place to work at. But, its just not for me. I like working towards a goal. Rent a center would be a good job for someone starting to get his life together in the work force."
good,Rent-A-Center provides a challenging career opportunity. You are responsible for so many aspects. Until you work in this environment you will never fully understand the skill level you must possess in order to be successful.
good,"I have worked with this company for many, many years.  It is very stressful because you perform your job to the best of your ability and you still get threatened with losing your job."
good,Great coworkers and benefits okay/  I don't really have any negative things to say.  Its a corporate company.  It is what it is.
good,"RAC isn't a terrible company to work for, but I have issues with one manager who was sexist. Everyone knew about it, even after it was brought up, nothing was done. Not only that, the same manager that was sexist also breaking rules. For example: calling customers from a personal cell phone, requesting/encouraging the employees harass customers. All so that this manager could hit their numbers."
good,"interesting job great opportunity to meet interesting people, customers are great. some not so friendly, management is fair and works with employees. the area is great."
good,"managed all aspects of daily operations including sales,credit,hiring etc.I was responsible for renting the products and also collecting the rental fees.i hired and train new employees and also coached employees and customers on a daily basis"
good,"Everything was good until the district manager chose to fault me for the store not getting good numbers. Our store was getting its credit numbers most of the time before they decided to merge the store i was working at with a store with poor credit numbers. The district manager chose to add gas to the fire instead of help extinguish it. He wasn't district manager material, he was more like assistant manager material because he really doesn't know the business."
good,I was let go on my 90 day but what sucked is they had me train my replacement saying that he was hired for another building in the area. So if i was not good enough to do my job why was i good enough to train someone else
good,"I was responsible for total store operations for up to twelve stores in four different states. My job included visiting a store daily to ensure compliance to company operating standards. In addition, I was responsible for all human resource issues including hiring."
good,start times are typically between 730 am and 900 am. usually work about 10 hours a day. not bad place to work but advancement was very slow. best part of the job were the benifits and gaurantee hours. the employees did work as team which was good.
good,"95% of what you do is people and the other 5% is the paperwork."
good,A typical work day at Rent-a-center begins with making phone calls for collections. Then the team gets together for a briefing to discuss daily goals and plan for the day. Most days typically consist of delivering merchandise to customers home in a timely matter. Some days have more deliveries. We are also responsible for doing field runs meaning knocking on doors to resolve account issues. I would say the hardest part of the job is the amount of time we spend at work. I am scheduled 45 hours a week mainly from 9-8. I sometimes find myself not being able to do things after work because of the hours.
good,Having to work 10+ hours a day really takes away from your home life. It's a great place for single young people to work but if you have a family it may not be for you.
good,Hard to control who pays account. To many confrontations with customers. but all in all great company to work for.
good,The job overall is very interesting with customer interactions. The pay is good but there are long hours and very little flexibility in making time for family.
good,"I enhanced my customer service in the two years a was employed at RAC. Although we had to work a mandatory 48 hours per week, I found time to have a social life. My co workers were people I knew from the neighborhood so I was very comfortable and even made new friends. the hardest part of my job was explaining to a customer why they have to return their merchandise and they best part of my job was interacting with customers and battling other stores in the market for prizes."
good,"Was a great place to work to get a guaranteed paycheck. Ruff workplace environment. split days off with 47 hour weeks, usually working from 8am-7pm 5 days a week. If you have a family prepare yourself to not see them very much because work always comes first. Even if you are sick they make you feel bad for trying to use your earned sick days."
good,"Plenty of room for advancement, but you will have no work/home life balance right from the start. If you have a family that you like spending time with then this is not the job for you. If you are single then this would be perfect. Advancement can happen fast as long as you have a willingness to learn. Also if you value having two consecutive days off then stay away. It will never happen unless you're on vacation."
good,"Rent-A-Center has been a well established organization for many years.  Their training program is top-notch and prepares every individual for their ""team role"".  Daily challenges are presented to each employee and every employee is held accountable for their performance.  Currently, the company is going through changes which includes a new CEO which just started the position this year.  This rent to own market has high margin mark-up and its customers are finding new avenues of product ownership.  The typical customers have ""wised up"".  In general, Rent-A-Center is ""playing catch-up"" to the revenue losses which have occurred for the year 2014."
good,the location I was employed at was great at first but then people and things change not for the good but for the bad. I would work for them again but it would have to be for a different management.
good,"overall good company hard working, moving furniture sales and all day on feet and face to face with customers. co workers can some time s be a handful and talk a lot about there personal life but very relaxing"
good,A meritocracy allowing for career growth through hard work and dedication.
good,no work life balance. amangement sucks. cars do all the work.
good,"I was able to move up fairly quickly in this company. All my co-workers were great, worked for this company in 2 states, with no problems."
good,Spokane area Management not willing to support Advancement
good,"A typical day at work consists of helping customers and talking to customers on the phone and dealing with a very wide variety of issues and problems, and just great and explain the rental process to every one that walks in the door. I learned how to deal with all types of people and got knowledge on how to solve different types of problems and come to agreements with them. Management is a little too overwhelming, as they are always worried about scheduling, service, hitting daily goals and staffing problems. Co-workers are always fun to work with and talk to while also getting along with customers and issues that we all had. The hardest part of the job is just the hours, basically being there for almost 60 hours per week at times was hard especially having a family. The most enjoyable part of the job was always helping customers and knowing that you made them happy as they always come back and ask for you personally if they have any other needs or issues."
good,"An overbearing job with loads of add on work on top of the original job description. As an assistant manager, store manager and general manager whom was stationed at our store would not allow us to leave unless we cleared our credit. Most days I was out late and numerous occasions I have clocked out at midnight. Terrible managers, great pay, shaddy policies, need I say more."
good,"Rent a center was a good job for someone with great people skills and it was diverse in all aspects. The management at my first location was terrific. But at my second store, the management left a lot to be desired."
good,"The day starts with getting the store's showroom ready and throughout the day increasing sales through rental agreements. I learned how to sell merchandise, verify customer order forms, complete day-to-day transactions, receive/transfer store products/info, and collect on past due rent. The # of hours are really good, but the scheduling is not ideal. (Ideal=M-F, 9-5pm)"
good,"On a typical day we would make collection calls in the morning, go out all day long to do deliveries, service calls, etc., come back around 6 - 6:30 pm and make more collection calls, then finally around 7:30 - 8 at night go home.  The upper management of this company does too much.  They all try to micro manage each and every store, instead of letting the store manager do those things.  I learned a lot at this job though.  It pays well, but the hours are horrible.  You must work 48+ hours every week, and the shifts are a normal 10 hours long.  It is taking a lot away from my family, I have 2 young children.  The hardest part of the job isn't the job itself, it's the time spent away from the ones you love.  "
good,"Renting and collecting learn alot from rent a center the weather was hard to work in due to rain,cold,hot but i love to work for the customers,they are the reason we all have a job...Customers are Number 1"
good,Great job to keep you in shape. Watch out for unethical practices.
good,"Daily routines not to hard to do, such as daily numbers and profit log."
good,"typical day at rent a center would involve coming in at 8 am getting all the daily weekly and monthly paperwork done, check all the sales that we had for the previous day then proceed to a morning meeting with the staff of the store. After the meeting would be complete I would then monitor the calls of the employees to the customers and follow up with the sales manager about what his plan for sales and the showroom were for that day."
good,"Made collection calls for past due customer, made sales calls for potential customer and existing customers, made delivery's for the location"
good,"a normal week at work would be a 48 hour-50 hour week. Not much time to yourself at all. Saturdays and mandatory. Saturdays are scheduled to be open at 8:30 in the morning and close at 8pm this is not an option. You get only 2 sick days/ personal days a year. Benfits are pretty good but pricey as are alot of places. You must be willing to work in dirty houses with roaches, bed bugs, fleas, etc,... The most enjoyable part of my job is my days off."
good,"Typical work day would be having to call customers to make sure they paid on there account. Co-workers were all about themselves and did not want to do a group effort at things. The hardest part of this job would of been the hard labor moving furniture the entire shift and that included filthy and damaged items. I learned that money isn't everything about a job even though I did get a good yearly salary, I did not enjoy going into work everyday."
good,Begin every morning with the collection calls made to our customers.
good,My day consisted of managing the store schedule and my employees. Making collection calls on past due accounts and handling customers in the store. I also maintained an inventory on a daily basis and was responsible for store revenue goals. The hardest part of the job were the long hours and collection aspect of the business. I would say I most enjoyed the sales side of the business and I became very successful with it. The ability to sell at a high level helped me make profits for my store and I loved it.
good,Very fast paced work environment. Better to work for if you do not have any small children.
good,"The days are long, and the customer interaction is varies between each customer. Very stressful environment for management. Personal time doesn't exist after 90 days."
good,"The job is amazing if you have no life outside of work. Yes it has kept a roof over mine and my sons head and food in our stomachs but other than that, no real benefit. I never get to see my son as i work 50+ hours a week with split days off."
good,Spend days training associates
good,repeatative same routine over and over again. recieved knowledge ofelectronics. Had opportuinity to advance. hardest part which is not one of my philosophy is watching customers who are already struggling put in more debt. enjoyed meeting all sorts of people everyday.
good,"Farmers was a really great company to work for I think it has to do with the kind of boss you have to , He pushed me to learn more always giving me more projects and when i left i could book keep with the best of them also he was a mentor I respected him so much the down fall is you dont make that much there. and it is getting alot harder to stay afloat, insurance is very exsoensive, but over all great company."
good,bad work life balance had to work 12 hours per day for 5 days a week
good,didnt get to spend that much time with family worked 12 hour days 5 days a week
good,in charge of the credit and sales department i increase revenue as well as manage accounts to decease loss
good,Great job to grow and introduce yourself to credit opperations
good,"not to bad of a place to work, unless they down graded, was good pay when i was employed, vacations, holiday pay, and sick pay, can be a little stressful at times, due to the management, and if employee applies them self, there is room for promotions"
good,"A typical day at work starts at 9am with sales calls,collections call and deliveries until the close of business which is 8pm.Ive been with the company for 4 years since then ive been promoted from collections manager to assistant manager,from there ive moved up to lead assistant and now on my way to a manager in training(MIT).The hardest part of the jobs is hitting our numbers in sales and collection if we dont do so we have our DM or Manager putting our Jobs on the line. The customers that Ive met and built a excite rapport with is the most enjoyable part of working there .Ive Learned procurement,and the steps to becoming a successful Manager in the business."
good,love driving the trucks to make deliveries to people's home. hated having to take stuff away if not abe to make the pmts on the rented items.
good,"As an employee this place is a great place to grow and advance. With the right training and attitude you could easily be an assistant manager in 3 months and a store manager in 6 months. The only down side to working for Rent A Center is the time you spend away from home. As an employee you will work a minimum of 48 hrs a week and 50 hrs as a manager. This is great for those who are single, but for those who are married or having other things you are obligated too outside of work, it makes it difficult."
good,"It's ok I guess for somebody who dont have a life,just work late hours on saturdays,and work every saturday,if credit not close on sat then u have to stay till 8 or 9 till credit is close.only have on day off in the week and sunday"
good,"It is a fast paced ready too go job a lot of heavy lifting. you drive a box truck unloading/loading most of the time, the other half you manage your accounts and repo accounts that need it."
good,"Was a pretty good work environment, some heavy lifting required. Have a strong stomach as some houses that you enter will not be clean and may smell badly"
good,"Good balance in work/family. easy daily tasks. Co workers are good. "
good,I have been a previous employee of the company and came back after a few years. Long hours short staff and pay isnt the best. No team work no effort to improve.
good,On a store level the integrity is lost in pursuit of sales goals. Seen fictional accounts created to meet expectations. Seen ghost contract created by several different stores.
good,No time for family no Saturdays off ever. Also long hours when numbers aren’t being met. The culture was great and great people to work with and that’s what drives you to keep pushing through all the downs. For an example walking in to roach and rodent infestation home to return an item. Yeah really discussing.
good,"A typical day at work included making routine phone calls to customers who were passed due, selling more invetnory to keep people renting, and deliveries."
good,because sometimes the customer don't pay on time there items they we have to pick up items where not pay so we have to pick items back it was kind of stressfull
good,"Rent a Center is a job not based on schedule but on how customers pay. Rent a Center comes with a lot of patience, you have to be ready to deliver,sale, and get your past due customers to pay. It’s a lot of stress tbh"
good,Its not a bad job but all the work put into the position i was working really wasn't worth the pay. I felt bad for Sales Managers and Store Managers because they're always under a lot of stress from the higher ups ( District & Regional Managers)
good,es buena empresa para laborar yo decidi salirme por reestructura en las comisiones disminuyeron notablemente
good,"good place to learn work under pressure,dependet a managers you have ,hypo need to keep your porcents inside the range they are asking ..............."
good,"If you're desperate for work or any management experience, the work and benefits isn't to bad. If you have goals and want to have a major successful career I'd suggest looking at other options."
good,"This job is for someone who has not family matters, kids, wife, husband. It is for someone who is looking to climb the corporate latter. You will need a strong drive to suceed."
good,I don't feel as if someone is hired as the sales manager and has to have a goal of 12 sales a day that other associates make it a point to take the sales. That was probably the only big issue I had with the company.
good,It was an overall interesting experience. The job was hard work. Difficult at times. I enjoyed all the customers. The work was just strenuous. It was back breaking at times.
good,Sometimes it's more about money and how many people rent from you then the care for customers who literally want to pay and cant. They could have better hours for the employees you generally dont have a life good job if your in your 20s
good,ok place to work stressful/with management.Long hours with the company and the pay is very low you dont get many raises or commendation for your job duties
good,"Overall it was a good company to work for, the management was always helpful.  The hardest part of my job was repo/collection of goods from customer's homes.  The best part of the job was interaction and customer service.  Helping customers with purchases."
good,"Good workplace culture. Had ping pong tables, enjoyed myself while working at RAC. Good opportunities given. preferable better feedback when employee is turned down for promotion."
good,It can be good if you are put with the right staff. It feels uncomfortable to rent to new people used things such as beds. Also feels like a waste of money for customers. Better to just save up and buy something new than to pay 2 to 3 times more for it in the long haul.
good,Loved working there but it’s just boring you really don’t get into it that’s why I left and the pay wasn’t all that unless u were one of the managers.
good,"Perfect job if you are young and starting employment. There is room to grow in the company. A lot of long hours making deliveries when you 1st start out with the company, but eventually opportunities will arise if you are good at your job."
good,"you get no time with family, no 2 days off together, but great place to get experience and promoted easily. The hours take up the entire day with only 2 separate days to get anything done."
good,Employees are great so is the customers.love learning different things of the job and learning about our customers from within there homes.............
good,"I know longer work here, but it was a fun place to work. The hours at the time got in the way with a young family life."
good,"I realize this company was only driven by the numbers from each store , they really didn't care how you produce their numbers, all they care about was sales and credit , consistently create competition store against store. The hard part about this position was manager were constantly trying to take all credit for  there staff production."
good,If you like to learn quickly and on the go this is the job for you. Its easy to transfer positions in the organization and there are always new opportunities.
good,Rent-A-Center is a company that promotes from within. It's values are customer based and was a excellent learning environment that new employee's could impact the business.
good,"i was under poor management, i was also hurt on the job and my boss would not fill out my work comp papers i had to go above her and she was the reason i was hurt sending me on 2 person jobs alone"
good,They would make the employees go after customers for collection as well as the one to pick up and deliver merchandise.  Sometimes the customers were very angry when we would arrive.
good,"Recently the workplace culture is just ok, and a little stressed. Tough place and overall environment to work in now. However if you are on the right team it is a great place!"
good,It gave me experience and a chance to advance. I enjoyed my co-workers and customers. It helped me gain personal skills when it came to one on one customer service interaction.
good,It’s literally just okay.  A typical days work is the regular opening and closing of the store nothing to special and nothing too tmexomsuming or hard
good,the most thing I enjoyed at this job was working as a team player we use to have meeting to comeuppance with new idea for the store so it. can run on a good wok base
good,"worked at Rent-A-Center full-time"
good,"loved working there. did lots of different things daily.  pay was great for the area. had a so so benefits. we had paid vacations,sick days,and a 401k. sad to see it closing down."
good,RAC is a laid back job that gets you out on the road talking to people. Sales sales sales. The bad part is when you have to repo someone’s merchandise.
good,"I’ve been with this company for ten years. A lot of ups and down but overall good experience. If it weren’t for the department shutting down, I’d still be with them. Good pay and decent benefits. My managers were understanding family people. They understand the importance of family and children so whenever I needed time off for that, they were more than willing to help in any way."
good,"No work/ life balance at all, don't like it sometimes! Hardest part of the job is picking up people's things even if they have little children. Most enjoyable part is the pay."
good,Good job for young person just starting out working you will learn team work and work in different location. Also learn who to work through different work conditions.
good,"i think that with the pay at other retail companies that rent a center is comparable, hardest part of the job is collections, culture is high stress, i did learn alot on this job and got promoted quickly, my managers for my district were great, kind, supportive and willling to so called get their hands dirty"
good,"So much was done to create a beautiful mission statement, with impressive mantra..."
good,Was hired as a customer account rep but got moved to delivery driver. Once hired the managers and corporate ladder will move you to where they want. You have to have a customer service or a salesperson personality.
good,good place for me while i was looking for another job. I couldn't do the collections job anymore. they lower pay in exchange for guaranteed overtime is lame.
good,"I enjoyed working for Rent a Center when I first started, but after a few years, things went downhill. Long hours, and no Saturdays off. I did learn how to start my own company from some things I learned from them."
good,"I did enjoy my job, it was just the amount of work they put on my shoulders, literally. I loaded the truck up myself, mostly went to deliveries myself, sometimes the owner's were delivering to helped me . Lack of help from manager . I loved the friendly atmosphere with me and my coworkers, we always had fun and laughed."
good,"Rent A Center is more of a place to use as a stepping stone for you to improve your skills at communication, customer service, and organization. I learned a lot when I worked there and even advanced to store management. The pay is very competitive and the overall experience is great. The company offers paid vacation time, great  benefits and the hours are a bit long but worth it. The only downfall is requesting time off and getting the days off you need for doctor appointments and such."
good,"The job offered (at the time) a nice wage. I most enjoyed doing delivery for Rent-a-Center, it helped me to manage my time better including time spent loading trucks, estimating time travel etc,."
good,"HORRIBLE, always short staffed, upper managers are rude, i do not wish anyone t apply her if the have family to take care of because i dont want her about it"
good,was not the best job but was consistant. the people i worked with were friendly and i got to meet someone new everyday. i also recieved 3 years of collections and reposetion experience with rent a center.
good,Rent a center is a good place to work. Didn’t care to much for the hours but they at a great company to work for with really good benefits. The only bad part was the hours worked daily.
good,The job tasks were easy but the upper management was terrible i was the only driver delivering couches and beds and bunkbeds by myself. I constantly had to be the work horse.
good,"It's a lot of hard work and long hours, but if you like working with the public, then it's a great place to work. i was able to build good relationships with my customers"
good,Delivered furniture and electronics and made sure all the merchandise got there in a certain time.. make sure it was properly set up for the customer .
good,if you don't mind working 50+ hours a week on salary and chasing numbers every day it can be a good place to make a career. I work 8am to 8pm every day I work. I had to let go one of my assistant managers so now I'm working 6 days a week with no extra pay. The money is pretty good especially if your in a store with a lot of customers you can make good money with bonues
good,Didnt really like rent a center not that the people werent great but you did so much for so little pay “work smarter not harder” that was said alot i had to move on from that. I wanted better
good,"Rent A Center as a company is great however, changes must be made at the management level. A Store Manager should be able to make more decisions about the development of coworkers."
good,You have to work very long hours as a requirement for this job. Most customers are awesome but the few bad ones do make the work experience less the pleasant. Employee purchase program is pretty nice perk.
good,Rent furnishings and appliances to people. Pick it up when they don't pay or move. It's a semi-toxic work environment. Everybody has specific numbers and goals that clash with each other.
good,Rent-A-Center is stressfull due to the fast pace and limited time framing of the business. Overtime is mandatory and therefore work to life balance does not exist there.
good,"Extremely taxing work environment, both mentally and physically, very un-flexible work schedule. You work long and inconvenient hours, but hard work is rewarded, i.e. free lunches, trips, paid days off. The stores are closed on Sundays and you get a set day off. The company closes for holidays and you get paid for them."
good,"Great company good job atmosphere learning is quick and easy "
good,It is a fun work environment. You go in to work and you start making courtesy calls to customers. Then you load up delivery truck to go on deliveries.
good,"Rent A Center has a national presence with location in every state.  Some store are franchised and some our run by the corporation. The Corporate office in located in Dallas, Texas"
good,"fast paced with little space, i learmned stronger customer service skills and phone techniques inbound and outbound, diverse customers, enjoyed the enganging with customers and co workers"
good,This was my first retail job. it was a fun job at times but I really didn't like the way it was ran. I didn't like the cold calling to the same customers every day.
good,If you are willing to work this company will reward you on many levels.  Pay is above average for qualification requirements.  Benefits are above average for the cost and if you want to move up you will have the chance if you are willing to do what it takes.
good,Fun and enjoyable workplace with the opportunity to tackle tasks under your own supervision and speed. Great co-workers and very family orientated staff
good,Rent-A-Center gave me boost in my customer service skills to help develop a good customer base while being able to excel in my learned skills.  I exceeding all sales goals.
good,"The job went through a lot of changes throughout the years. Some were great and some weren't. As far as the pay it is decent, but the job can be a bit excessive at times"
good,I worked here for a long time. You can have a consistent job here but it is a lot of labor work and you don't really move up much. Learned a lot of customer service skills though.
good,"There were different projects being implemented which sometimes made your work environment difficult.  Changes in policy and procedures, new  HR software being updated."
good,"On a daily base, I would contacted customer by phone to close a deal. Other days customers will walk-in the store which that will make it better because I would know what the customers needs. promptly educated the costumers on their new agreement."
good,Well rounded  really enjoyed working there learn slot to prepared me for my future jobs in sales and delivery. I was a great opportunity really met a lot of people that i could take with me Thur life
good,"Relaxed work environment, a lot of physical labor. Using equipment to move furniture and appliances in and out of the store as well as customers houses."
good,working with customers is always fun. you get to knoiw the customers well bc most of the customers are returning to get something new. deliveries were usually ok..
good,"I worked for RAC for over ten years. I was a manager for eleven of those years. As a manager you are totally responsible for sales, collections, rent readiness and overall inventory management of your location. Having a staff will help with all of this as they do the sales and collections but if you don't you have to fill in those roles until you hire someone to do the job. You have to find time to recruit and hire. You also must find time to train and encourage your employees to do their best. This can become very difficult when you do not have a staff. There's a lot of paperwork and projections that you have to come up with. The company made some management (DM) mistakes along the way but it's overall, a very challenging and exciting place to work. You have to meet daily, weekly, monthly and yearly goals. If you are coming out of high school or a recent grad looking for entrepreneurial experience this is a great place to work. You'll learn a lot and will be able to carry that experience later in life. Just don't stay as long as I did."
good,Working at RAC was a very beneficial experience for me personally and ethically. I was able to improve on my organizational skills and communication skills. Multi tasking was one of my favorite attributes working in a fast paced environment. I perfected my work ethic by working very long hours and still being positive through any and all situations.
good,This is a great place to work for people that do not have a college degree. it is an entry level position with not much room for growth in the company.
good,Company is ok to work for. Compensation is not fair vs amount of work they give you. Never staffed properly and management did not really care for the well being of the employees
good,Working at rent-a-center was great. The team was great and helped a lot with work and helped when there was trouble delivering furniture. The pay was alright because it was weekly.  The only problem is that the hours are very long.
good,"My impression was that upper management did not know where it wanted the company to go.  "
good,"typical day starts around 8 to 9 in the morning and doesn't end until 7 to 8 at night . i learned how to approach customers differently according to the situation. the culture is overall good friendly, but competitive which i liked, really not much was difficult other than not having much family time."
good,"RAC is a dynamic work environment for the Network Engineers, professional and caring management team. Thousands of remote networks, great team spirit."
good,Usually the day is started with loading deliveries for the day. Afterwards we would fill in areas on the floor with product as needed. hardest part would be stair cases with certain products.
good,you are pretty much a repossession professional. Things may have changes since I worked there. I would not recommend this job to anyone else unless it was a last resort.
good,"Fmgood work hours closed sundays "
good,The company is very great to work for. The only reason I would consider leaving is if I had a better job offer and that people who are just getting hired are making a decent amount more than I make myself
good,Good company to work for but can be stressful too. Often felt like you worked hard long hours but all of your positive results were over looked but anything negative was always brought to the light!
good,"On a typical day, a CAR would start their day by calling all the customers that are past due, as well as those that are due currently. When a balance cannot be collected, a CAR would go to a customers home in the attempt to collect a debt. If the customer could not be contacted, a door tag would be left."
good,No work to home life balance. Quality of life is gone. Job requirements can be difficult and goals can be hard to meet. Satisfying but depriving all at once.
good,Good place to work but pay could be better. Better have a strong back to make it through the more difficult deliveries. Price break on home furnishings.
good,"Healthcare Benefits are great.  Discounts on furniture, electronics and appliances are great and the ability to pay off by deduction from check.  Paid Weekly - Awesome!  Poor management.  Low pay.  Day after Thanksgiving is not a paid holiday.  Someone in each department has to work.  Leaving early before a holiday does not exist.  The paid holidays are 1 day for each of the following: Memorial Day, 4th of July,  Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Day, New Years Day."
good,I worked there for 7 years total brought the store from making it by to excelling after i left the store closed down in 2017. I know what to do to grow a business but my ideas were never heard it was do as i say not as i do tyoe of environment i will never return to a company who doesnt compensate for the effort and work put into the business. best decision i made was to leave
good,The work day consisted of picking up and delivering furniture and appliances to customers quickly as possible.  The management was pretty good.  The hardest part of the job was going into unclean houses that made it difficult to deliver and take furniture away.  The most enjoyable part was riding in the truck with fellow employees.
good,We are not focused on the basics of taking care of coworkers and customers. to many new programs and flavors of the day that take precedent over running a profitable business
good,"Really good job.  Hard but rewarding, busy sales oriented. Sales and delivery upon  reference approval. 8am usually to 8 or 9pm, Most managers were tough but professional, other were lazy."
good,Culture at RAC is what have you done for me lately. It is a performance based job and company. You must give it a 110% at all times. Work the process and hold your people accountable for their  positions. The customers I have meet over the years made the job more rewarding.
good,I enjoyed my position. BUt in the year that I was with that company we had $ different mangers and all had a different style of working. that became stressful because you were just getting adjusted to their style when they were let go and another brought in
good,I was brought on to this company for my skill set and was told that certain agreement between us were to meet by certain time and still no movement from upper management. My salary hasn't been giving fully due to their lack of communication.
good,"I Loved bonding with my team and customers but the stress level was too much at the end and did not see the light at the end of the tunnel, I would say the overall experience was good"
good,"Have No comments. I just change job looking for better benefits and longer stability. The manager was bad, do not had respect for employees. He do not work there anymore"
good,It all depends on how you look at it if you like from taking up from underneath people home then you would love this job.. Police doesn't back you up so no help in the thieft area if the customer decides not to pay and just keep it Nashville Ar has lots of Repos
good,"This is a fun place to work if you have a competitive spirit. Employees are expected to do a number of duties. Employee are expected to rent, collect, deliver, pickup, and repair merchandise when necessary."
good,"Every position at Rent A Center is a sales driven position. Even as a Customer Account Representative (CAR), which entails Delivery and pick up of merchandise, making credit and sales calls, setting up, moving, and cleaning merchandise and showroom. "
good,Very easy business to learn but training and development are lacking. They focused strictly on the results but did not teach you how to achieve the the results
good,It was an ok job to have very chilled on weekdays super busy  on weekends cool to meet people  and see how people live also can be a weird job when it comes to getting your stuff back from unpaid account users
good,It was stressful and time consuming jib you work long hours no matter the weather and had to sale items that had been used and wore out constantly. I didn't really like this job
good,"ok job very stressful must be ready to work and have thick skin due to customers.  Lots of lifting and long hours,very high turn over rate, lots of pressure to make store numbers.  overall good company to work for your pay rates will increase with time and performance you have to be a people person"
good,"Not the experience I was hoping for. I went in with high hopes of managing my own store. I was transferred several times to ""fix"" stores but never given one to run. Disappointing to say the least."
good,"keeping the floor clean organize the furniture assemble the furniture"
good,The work environment with Rent A Center was tough.  Delivering account and collecting was the primary jobs. Long hours and no time for family or friends.
good,"Rent a center was a laid back workplace, easy going, nothing too hard about the job. Management was above average. Some days, we would all would have fun days and then some days it wouldn't, like any other job. Nothing hard about the job, just deliver the merchandise to the customer safely. Slow days were easy, from cleaning the merchandise to cleaning the store floor. Most enjoyable part of the job was the driving. Just driving, you to yourself and get to your destination on time. Customers were not bad usually, you would have your days were customers can difficult to deal with but barely."
good,Rent A Center used to be a challenging entrepreneurial place to work.  Over the years it became a place focused mainly on numbers and less on people.  The micromanaging took away ones feeling of empowerment which has led to job dissatisfaction. I am forever grateful for the opportunities I had that provided for myself and my family but left in order to pursue a better culture and opportunities to grow and lead.
good,Review accounts remind customers of timely payments. Learned that a good planned day can go a lot more relaxed than an unplanned day. Business casual environment had a great team well communicated and polite team workers. Hardest part of the job ill say was stain removing of prior rented items such as sofas. I enjoyed more the cleaning and set up of store cause am a clean enthusiasts.
good,I learned a great deal from my tenure with the company.  It set me on a path for success.  Coworkers were the best part of the job!  Hard to maintain company standards at all time
good,good workplace enjoy working there wit good peoples good management good hours great pay good place to work an advance in  the company an make a good career
good,If you decide to work at RAC be ready to be treated as a number and nothing else.  The pay is decent but the turnover at the top it quite troubling.  I had 3 DM in 2 years
good,Rent-a-center is not a bad place to work. The hours just make it hard to have a life outside of work. Rent-A-Center taught me hard work does pay off..
good,Good place to work room for advancement but you do have to work hard to move up. I like to previous management and the ability to work with people daily.
good,"Typical day work consist of a 7hr day for 3 days and some times I would deliver furniture other days I would sell furniture."
good,my Resume was very descriptive of my duties. i learned all about the rent to own business  renting and collecting.  i learned to grow accounts and earn a profit for the store and company.
good,great place to work loved the job and if they were to have another position available i would readily apply and be glad to work there it was a great job
good,"Good benefits, friendly work environment, collection driven. This job is geared towards single person households due to the hours that are required of managers and because of the retail environment."
good,I would like a career with the possibility of career growth and where I feel comfortable in my position and I don't feel that is something that I can do in my current position.
good,Everyone comes to work and work together to reach the daily achievement. The hardest part of the day is getting customers to make payments. everything else is fairly easy
good,Rent A Center is not a place where you would want a career in. The pay is less than the job we actually do there. Management sucked. Getting yelled at for not meeting the goal.
good,"Ok place to work. Paid hourly. Required to sell merchandise. Hardest part of job - Must be jack of all trades, Sell, Assemble, Deliver product. As well as Make routine calls to  promote new merchandise and/or remind/collect payments. If payments cannot be made must repossess the product."
good,"I can't explain because each experience is different, just Like each manger,40 hours week & if your delivering then looking at 13 hours week plus overtime without notice. No overtime pay."
good,I is a job where people go to make money and this suvay is crazy.These reviews mean nothing to anyone out there this is very crazy to make people do thing like this to submit a resume
good,"a typical day at work dealt with the deliver of rented merchandise to customers homes and completing sales when they walked into the showroom. Hardest part was calling customers about missed payments, unclean houses we had to deliver or pickup unpaid merchandise, customers being irate about us calling, and placing notices on their doors. our manager was a little too extreme when it came to dealing with customers and he turned a lot of them away with his attuide and poor people skills. I tried to work with the customer as much as possible within the company guidelines."
good,Company Culture Need improvement. Respect coworkers and promote a collaborative working environment. Good training and promotion opportunity; Good facility and location.
good,"A typical day for me at Rent A Center is I show up, take a look at the schedule and decide the best route for the day. Call customers to make sure they are on time with their payments and if not schedule a time to take action on that. Build merchandise as needed and do deliveries, take payments in the store etc."
good,"Didn't really like working here the dress code is professional I.e. Tucked in shirts, slacks, dress shoes to a job that requires you to lift, load, unload,carry and assemble heavy furniture."
good,"I personally think females should stay in the stores to make sure the store looks presentable when customers come in. They should not be doing deliveries, some merchandise is way to heavy for a female to be lifting."
good,"Manage customer accounts and coordinate payment schedule. Strong focus on customer service. Responsible for inventory control. Responsible for collections and identifying, analyzing and solving customer problems."
good,"I worked for Rent A Center for 5 years. In all of my 5 years here I enjoyed my employment. RAC gives its employees growth, good incentives to hit your goals and just a overall good environment."
good,I think its great an i think if your trying to start a career its the perfect place to start my experience here is good but i just wish we had weekends off..
good,Deliver merch. and call customers. make sales and fix problems with equipment. nice atmosphere to work in and with great people. this is a typical job for a family man.
good,"A typical day is loading/unloading the truck on deliveries and filing paperwork. Management sucks at my location. Store manager does the bare minimum, lazy and lacks social skills at times. Makes it hard on some days when we don't have the proper tools or supplies for deliveries. Days go by easier and less stressful when all the equipment is there and the paperwork is ready. Hardest part of my job is walking into some customers dirty house. Some people have some foul living conditions. And dodging the BUGS!!"
good,If you enjoy working with the public and helping them to get something for their home that they need/want this job cold be for you. It's about providing a service for someone.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the day was helping customers rethink there financial plan. I would often sit with customers and help them with an affordable budget. The hardest part was not meeting our store goals, we would often stay in and make phone calls until 9pm on a Friday night to get people to pay there bills, i felt like i was harassing people, i was the most hated by far because the job made me cut throat, i would get people to return there merchandise because i simply told them they couldn't afford it from the start.  Management would change each quarter, i seen someone get promoted to district manager and less than a year later get demoted back down to store manager."
good,rent a center is a rip off they charge way to much for carp items .and if you dont pay we came and got your stuff . its not with buying anything from there
good,I have worked for this company for 4 years now and the advancement opportunities are unlimited. The company pays well for the job you do and gives you paid vacations with sick days as well.
good,"decent place to work with decent pay. There was not many benefits for full time employees. the insurance was expensive, and did not cover as much as it should have for the price"
good,"I worked this job out of college and it was good for a little while, learned a lot of my customer service experience here which helped in my career up to date."
good,"Work is not stressful can be fun at times just needs more hours supervisor is great my team was great ,I enjoyed helping customers get what they needed"
good,Ok place for PT job during high school or college.  Can't say I learned much about electronics.   Management was nice and there's opportunity for advancement if you really want it.
good,This is a good job for a kid out of high school and decides he or she doesn't want to pursue college. I like it but it is a very stressful job and is very time-consuming.
good,Was a place to gain income and maintain until other opportunities arrived. Not much room to learn new skills. Teammates were helpful when allowed.  A job
good,I've learned great interpersonal skills with the company and a family feel within the coworkers. advancement with hard work and great performance pays well.
good,working for rent a center was mediocre at best. great benefits but not many changes to move up in the comapany. usually people never give this type of job us
good,"The company discounts and the overtime will keep you there.  There is a constant fear of ""what you might be taking home with you""...roaches, bed bugs, ect."
good,it was a great company. Needs to work on its communication from management to store level employees. Needs more in company growth.  I have enjoyed my time in the company. Dealing with customers was hands on.
good,"fun place to work .. great co workers .. the hardest part of the job is  the stress of it all .. good management helpful when u need them , will to teach you what you need to grow in the company."
good,"Experience gained, long hours, scheduling, handle customers complaints. The hours are the hardest and two days off during the week is what I like best."
good,"The job was relaxed, but the customers were sometimes a big pain when they couldn't afford payment.  I did not like cold calls or calling for collections.  The pay was too low for what you had to deal with."
good,"morning account call through, establish deliveries and pick-ups for the day, load the truck with the needed deliveries, and once completed, an evening account call through is completed."
good,"I was an assistant manager and after dedicating a year ad 40+ hours a week, I was demoted to a delivery driver because I re enrolled in college. Despite my classes not effecting any sales event , they refused to accommodate my schedule."
good,its a good place to work you stay active. the manager keeps you on your toes. you stay busy with moving furniture and appliances. your constantly on the go.
good,"Typical day consists of organizing showroom, cleaning appliances,writing rental agreements and collection calls. Slow during week and busy on the weekends."
good,"If the company could separate or focus on just one task, then I would have a better rating. But, where you are required to deliver and then also reposition from same customer. Not my idea of good business. If you could have one side of the company do one side, and then hire a different team to do the second, would be much better!"
good,It was some hard work carrying household goods in and out of homes when you were not welcomed by the customer. Then as an account manager after you spend a great deal of time and effort to finally pick up delinquent furniture you would end up bringing it right back when the customer paid up to date just to start over.
good,they have a mandatory 48 hour for account reps and 50 hour for management.you constantly have to look over your shoulder to see if your gonna get fired for having a bad sales or collections week
good,"This is a good place to advance if you are willing to put in the time. This job will take up a substancial portion of your life, if you have kids and are the sole provider, i would not recommend. Most employees are enjoyable to work with and can make it fun to work. This job does provide Sundays off, but with the business model does not leave room for calling in, or taking time off. However does provide good heath care."
good,"Was an ok job, often had to stay late if goals werent hit, training was more learn as you go than I would have liked. The hours and recieving time off were almost non negotiable"
good,"not a friendly and conducive workplace, the product is old and warn"
good,"Growth opportunities in sales, collections, and delivery goals. Worked in a team environment. Meeting and exceeding standards. Providing great customer service. Delivery of merchandise to satisfy customer."
good,If you are looking for a long term career I would not recommend as the turnover rate in management is high. You are only as good as yesterday's numbers is a phrase that is well known within the company.
good,Job Hours weren't always available every week. During slow times hour gets cut dramatically. Management were awesome but very unorganized. Always walk in and people don't know whats going on.
good,"This job takes a lot of your time away from home. you have to work every weekend. And you have to work every Sat. "
good,"Company is facing challenges that have led to the dismantling of the PMO (project management office). However the people that work there are driven towards success. The morale currently is mixed due to the turnover the company has experienced at the executive level. However, that should not take away from the overall direction and hopeful vision that the management team has and hopes to deliver upon."
good,Not exactly the worst place to work. It is a trial by fire kind of place. They will throw you into the hardest of situations just to see if you can handle it.
good,rent a center is a good company but the management could be better also your going to work your butt off in some dangerous areas so make sure if you work for this company its in a safe area because you deliver in all kinds of areas.
good,Overall a decent place to work at. The philosophy of the company got lost in the way down the chain of command a lot though. Very stressful work environment but plenty of upper mobility opportunities.
good,"Unsure why this popped up again but RAC is an ok place to work, great pay and benefits but long work hours and youre expected to put business over family 100 percent of the time"
good,good management but the system takes advantage of the less fortunate. There has to be a better way to help customers out.
good,A typical day at work consists of mainly customer satisfaction. We try to sell and deliver quality products to customers as quickly as possible. The most enjoyable part of the job was the coworkers.
good,very demanding job you help in every department/ good to place work if you are young /lot of lifting furniture and appliances
good,"5 day work week. Learned how to budget employees, manage account of customer to keep them in good standing, and inventory audits. Was a learning experience."
good,"Had a great manager and district manager, had some independence, but also teamwork.  long hours, but it was worth it.  Pay start out wasn't terrible at the time."
good,"Job is okay, wouldn't recommend long term."
good,"Pretty good pay with long hours. After my current job, I would gladly return to this job. The hours can get too much to handle and it can be stressful when you fail to hit your past due goals. The reason I'm not here anymore is after I was in a car accident i was not allowed to lift or move anything over 50 lbs and instead of allowing me to just work in the store, they terminated me because I couldn't move sectional sofas and refrigerators anymore. But all in all, this is a good job."
good,"fair pay but not enough for the job you will have to do, long hours you pretty much work from sun up to sundown, no weekends off you will never have a weekend off, bad upper level management doesn't communicate well enough, "
good,"Can learn a lot about different types of people that's for sure, all walks of life. A lot of the activities are very repiticious, doing the same thing on a daily basis."
good,This is a fun place to work the customers are nice and the management is cool. long days and the store is your home but its an ok job that someone who has customer service skills will love
good,Rent-A-Center works some serious hours. though paid out for your overtime was not a good fit for me. 12 hour days 5 days a week though great. didn't work for me
good,"None I do not want to review this company, there are not many  positive words that I can say so I would rather not say anything"
good,"nice friendly work place, everyone got along "
good,"I worked at a store where I was only one of two delivery drivers, at the busiest store in the region. I averaged around 7 large deliveries a day, even when I was on my own. While they claim that you will work no more than 25 hours a week, I was working close to 40 during school. The increased hours would be nice during the summer, but not if it interferes with college."
good,"Working in NYC has been in deed a challenge from many perspectives, but the turn over rate has been without a doubt the biggest of all the challenges."
good,"Learned payroll, hiring training development of coworkers, cash handling, security protocols, Work with a Fortune 500 opportunity were not present once you hit my level stocks were plummeting and bonuses and contastant CEO, EFO, DVP were constant changes."
good,Empresa totalmente dirigida al bienestar del cliente y colaboradores.
good,"Very long hours you would have no time for yourself or other family members. RAC would say that they promote from within a lot, but would bring a stranger off the street and give them a higher position."
good,"During my time at RAC, I started with a Franchise, loved that I was able to make major decisions for the business. Had daily interaction with customers."
good,"Working for Rent A Center took away from family time.  The hours that you were required to work left no room for family, appts, etc.  The demands of the job were very high."
good,"Typical days were never typical. "
good,Pretty much a topical payday loan business.  Collections calls very day twice a day.  Once a week I went to delinquent customers home or work location if they had not made or met payment arrangements.
good,you need thick skin to work this job successfully. the hours are not beneficial to vacationing or having a second job. should offer tuition reimbursement program

good,come in and checked by emails since I was the one of the emailed team supervisor had to answered over 100 emails a day. I also took care of escalated calls and took care of customer as needed.
good,On a average day I will have a delivery but if there isn't any deliveries I am stuck in a slow pace store where there is not much to do so now I am trying to stay busy by calling new customers to boost sales but that normally terms out into not interested.
good,"Pros"
good,"I enjoyed my time at this company while it lasted.  Usually it was a fun place to work at and I enjoyed working with the staff under me.  With plenty of room to grow in the company, it was a good place to work.  My only problem were the hours expected of management and staff.  It didn't leave much room for home/family time."
good,"I would clock in we would have a quick meeting discuss the day we had ahead of us then we would un load the truck for about 2 hours receiving as the merchandise would come in, after that we would go on a 10 min break the stock the shelves on the sales floor."
good,"A typical day would include daily deposit, sales calls, review past due accounts, problem solving, customer interaction, upselling of product, pushing promotion items, refurbishing of products, delivery of products, calling customers, and customer satisfaction."
good,challenging work environment with many challenges. The constant credit issues where not a fun thing to deal with. a very large company and easy to get lost in the crowd.
good,Depending on the location you will deal with different kinds of customers. At this sort of job dealing with merchandise you come in contact with a variety of people and house environments.
good,"We normally do alot of calling and Acct adjusting. But we still get out in the field and do things such as Delivering furniture, Running Customer in the field, and ect."

good,"Set the store for sales, start telemarketing and putting information into computer on sales. I learned how to become a sales manager."
good,company was ok but repossessions are horrible and dangerous. the company does not really assist with safety control in repossessions.
good,Very busy and aggressive environment. Daily goals to meet and set. Do have great benefits. Have holidays off. Pay was well. Working around great personal.
good,"Management do not  care about your personal life as long as you show up for work (There is some exceptions). The company stands for making coworkers life better but the District Manager only cares about the coworkers as that, they do not want to acknowledge that they do deserve to have a family life too, just like Rent a Center intends it to be"
good,Call all customers from am to pm make sure all customers are paying on time find out problems and solutions make sure all customers are satisfied
good,Busy schedules with heavy work.  Long hours Interestinbg to see how people live in their homes. Great people to work with.  Most managers are eay to get along with
good,I overall enjoyed my job it was just the hours 13 hours away from home everyday isn't a family style life. I liked helping my customers i loved training my employees. I love management period its what I good at.
good,the company was fun to work for but the people i worked with in my store werent very fair. i had a coworker that was harrasing me and calling me names and i went to management about it and it stopped for a little bit but then it stared again and i went over my managers head and once i did that the whole office stared to make my work day hard and unenjoyable to the point i felt i had to quit my job.
good,"Interesting place to work, if you have a good get attitude you will be successful with working at Rent A Center, from time to time the job can be rather stressful"
good,It is a rent to own business. Rent various products to customers who does not have great credit and cannot go to department store to purchase. Very challenging and fast paced business.
good,I was a challenging employment with little to no recognition of corporate level of achievments. My district Manager was one of the most motivating person I knew and always made your job worth coming too.
good,"Great environment for one that likes task variety. However, very taxing on individuals with families because of the variability of hours worked and uncertainty of daily schedules."
good,"Loved the typical day, learned a lot, management was great, co workers were enjoyable, nothing hard, loved meeting people."
good,"If you need something steady where you're guaranteed to get paid a set amount every week. Hours vary but you get the same amount. I wouldn't recommend it for someone who has small children because it's not exactly flexible. The branch I work for is constantly  changing policies because a lot of them honestly don't make sense, but like I said, you get paid every Friday. It involves collections. Yikes. The people you're collecting on can cuss you out over the phone or in person and every problem they have is YOUR fault because you also sell the product. Like I said, you get paid every friday. Work hard and you get bonus check every month. Hours suck. Policies suck for you and the customer.  It's a job though."
good,"It was long day"
good,A typical day at rent a center was to call the customers that were late on there payments and to try and get there payment or the items that they owned

good,"I learned a lot working for Rent a Center. Every job has its pros and cons, this job what ever position you hold, does consume a lot of your time away from every day life, and family. If your single, and new to an area, RAC will help you get adjusted. If your a family person, I suggest you look for a job elsewhere,"
good,"Long days, little reward. no family life. no chance of bonuses unless you are a store manager. company seemed to not really care about its employee's"
good,"I would be the first one at work to open up and plan the day and make goals for the day. We would start off by making sure the floor was 100%, and make sure all product was rent ready. We would then begin making pass due calls to customers that was late. Working in rent to own I've learned customer service skills and problem solving, and managing people. it was a fast pace job and  sometimes there was a little micro management, but we got the job done. There wasn't really anything hard about the job, and what I enjoyed the most  was being able to help and assist a customer in getting what they were looking for."
good,"fast paced company with too many job requirements to effectively be executed at store levels. co workers are not given time to properly execute and finish work place demands due to the structuring of daily work place tasks."

good,I truly enjoyed working at Rent-A-Center. I enjoyed setting up and delivering appliances and furniture. especially liked helping customers pick out products for their homes.

good,"Its a job made for experience. it takes a special person to work here."
good,"I began working for Rent A Center in January of 2013. When I was hired, I was lead to believe that I would be responsible for making sales. This quickly turned into performing collections duties, deliveries, and other miscellaneous tasks that were not originally explained. "

I had to make sure that a weekly 	inventory was done to 	reduce shrink.  As a store manager I won several contest 	and awards."
good,"This job was fun, except for the manager who took over our store he was not there to help family's in need he was rude and needed to be releaved from his position, but I just chose to walk away."
good,It's a company that's for the company not for the people who dedicate 10 to 12 hours a day there.
good,You worked from the time you got there to the time you left with some days being heavier then the others
good,"Rent-A-Center is great job for learning customer service.  You learn about collections, sales, delivery, and customer service.  Work days are long but its worth the time.

At 5pm the CAR come back to call past due customers again and get ready for the evening collection runs. The manager will assist in the in home collecting if need be. The assistant closed the store down and finishes any paperwork around 7pm depending on the customers. The day usually ends around 8 if you we not sucessful with in home collection.

good,No day is the same at Rent A Center.  You could learn alot about people and furniture and appliances.  The managers are great and you really are a team the hardest part is the hours not very flexible espeicaly if you have a family.  Hours definately are not good if you have children.  
good,"A typical work day includes sales, collections, and delivery and pick up of merchandise."
good,the company is a good company itself but has to many chiefs and not enough indians and is very slow in promoting the right people to the right position
good,this company was ok to work for due to the overtime.
good,"A typical day at Rent-A-Center involved going in and calling customers that were past due first thing and then we would run our routes to the customers who had past due amounts to collect payment or merchandise and then we would go back to thr store and help customers in buying merchandise from the store and then while we were notbusy we would clean and set up displays of merchandise. I did not like management because they were not concerned with personal well being and we would have to move heavy furniture such as couches, beds and heavy kitchen appliances alone with no help. I had good co-workers who would help you if you were behind and tried to reileve you with helping load heavy merchandise. The hardest part of the job was having to deliver the merchandise alone even upstairs . The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people."
good,"Daily store operations.Lots of training,and certifications.The hardest part of the job was work/home balance.The most enjoyable part of my job was creating a wonderful atmosphere,everyone reaching goals together,and meeting new people daily."

good,Nice as long as you like working late hours calling past due customers to pay their bill.
good,ethics and moral of the company is horrible. also forced overtime.
good,I will start off by saying that the pay is the only thing that shines about this job but to me the pay was not good for the work i did and the people i had to deal with.. sad to say that the mangers would get on to you about accounts simply because they would get chewed out from the higher ups. now they would give people things they know they could afford and send us out to get them back and if you couldnt they would blame you. Now the thing was the lucky one that got the things back would still get chewed out because returns because people wouldnt/ couldnt pay on the items that they would get. you work almost all year and do all the leg work and just try and enjoy the pay. I dont know how it is for everyone else that works and is not a Customer Account Rep( CAR) so thats just my View as i were a CAR only.
good,awesome work enviornment.. fast paced and definite room for advancement..
good,"I started with RAC as an account manager and quickly advanced up the ranks finishing as a GM. I ran 8 different stores in 4 different states (not simultaneouly). I learned how to manage a P & L and a lot about growing business in financially depressed climates. I had to work every Saturday and some holidays. I was first in and last to leave. I was moved around to different stores as kind of a fixer which wasn't bad for a single guy without kids. Eventually this got old and promises of mid-level promotion always faded away as there would always be ""just one more store to fix!"""
good,Typically you go in and make your past due calls till lunch. After lunch you load the truck and start making your deliveries for the day and any pickups that you may have as well. There are a lot of different aspects to a rent to own company. I learned about how the markups are done how much advertising is need alone with different types of sale strategies. Genially the co-workers help each other out to make it easier on each other whenever possible. The hardest part of the jobs was make deliveries and pickups just because sometimes you’ll have to do it by yourself with help. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was the selling part. I enjoy interacting with people and for me it makes the day go by faster.
good,"a typical day was, coming in clocking in making morning collection calls then setting up the day for deliveries, collection runs, and service calls. The mind state was sale and hit daily numbers. through rain, sleet, snow gotta hit numbers. Make sure account managers are making the correct amount of calls, while i concentrate on sales and customers in the store. Inventory twice a week with budgets once a month."
good,"After working at Rent-A-Center for 7 1/2 years I was able to obtain some great leadership skills by being the MailCenter lead for the Plano, TX Corporate Office. I had a team of 3 people that worked with me daily and we meet all our daily requirements in a timely manner each day. There was really not a hard part to the job very laid back but busy at times so that made the day go faster. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking with different stores daily and helping them resolve issues they may have on their end."
good,"organize sales floor, handled customers new and existing accounts, delivered merchandise, collected merchandise, handled deposits"
good,A typical day on the job will have to do with working hard in a super timely fashion.
good,This job overall is a fun fast paced environment. I enjoyed the customer as they made you want to come to work daily. Management was also fun. The hardest part would be delivering furniture in hard places to maneuver.
good,You learn new things every week. I advanced my skills a lot here. Very strict work environment with no time off.
good,"A typical day at Rent-A-Center is... well, there are no typical days at Rent-A-Center. You never know what may develop as the day unfolds. It's part of the challenge and fun of working there. I learned many valuable skills at Rent-A-Center including how to properly drive a box truck, dealing with difficult/picky customers, and proper phone etiquette to name a few. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the satisfaction of a job well done. The most challenging part of the job would be knowing I would sometimes have to take a child's bunkbed, or a single mom's refrigerator."
good,learned financial service very well
good,Never a dull day. High turn over rate. It will eat your life 50+ hours week are a minimum.
good,"Sales, collections, inventory, customer service, management, bank deposit."

good,"Assisted customers with accounts,open/closed business. made sure accounts were current and not late."
good,There was always something to do and was not the same everyday.
good,"clock in.(let me just say there really isn't a typical day at rent a center)(things don't always happen in this order) get the store rent ready.look at the daily activity planner. make round of collection calls. sales calls. preload the truck for deliveries then we take lunch. Clock back in and execute day according to the ""DAP"". Halfway through the days tasks make second call through. Continue with the rest of the deliveries.pickups and services and head back to the store. Depending on whether credit is high or if its decent, we will either make a third call through or go ""running"" which is basically field visits to those whom we have had a hard time trying to reach.. End of day procedures. clock out and go home. (theres alot more to a day at rent a center than i mentioned such as reorganizing the backroom, filling holes on the floor. returning, cleaning, and tagging merchandise. taking payments over the phone and at the counter. troubleshooting over the phone. all around customer service. handle legal documents. sales in store."
good,"i enjoyed working for this company longs hour days but you had your accounts and you had to manage if that ment driving to pick up a payment , gettin a hold of a customer or just helping someone find a tv or bedroom set that fit there needs and financial budjet,"
good,"RAC is a company that will promote you quickly whether you are ready or not to be promoted. As a manager you will make great money if you perform, but you will not have any time to enjoy it. If you are a female you better be use to language and discrimination, because there is plenty of that to go around there. If you have all the time in the world to work in a fast paced demanding job with no money until you get promoted to manager then this job is for you. When you become a manager you will make the money if you are good, but your hours will increase. Oh and no sick time at all. You get two days a year. You will not get vacation for a year and during Christmas and holidays you have to work an extra half day for taking the holiday off work. In addition if you ever get cancer or your wife has a baby you will be fired if you need to take care of your family or go through treatment. You will also be reprimanded for taking FMLA and made to come back before you have a release. Enjoy your awesome RAC family. They truly do not care about you at all less you are bringing in the bucks, and if you get extremely ill and have been bringing in the bucks, they would just as soon let you go.They staff the minimum staff and all must be there each day or you are jacked. The job can be rewarding and time passes fast if you work hard. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you get off work."
good,There is opportunity for rapid advancement through hard work
good,"Rent A Center is a tough cookie! First, unless you are a store manager you get paid penuts! They slave you from morning to night. If you have a family, especially small children, this is NOT the job for you!! In fact, if you have a life at all, this is NOT the job for you."
good,I enjoyed working here during collection time. I did not care for working the sales floor. My typical day involved going out and collecting on past due accounts.
good,"A challenging place to work in that you are called upon to do a variety of task on a daily basis. Work is never boring because of the many people with whom you come into contact with every day. The hardest part of the job is probably the physical labor of delivering furniture and the complex personalities and situations you encounter on a daily basis. Each store consists of only 4-6 people so getting along with and cultivating relationships with your coworkers is very important. The most enjoyable aspect of the job is when you accomplish your goals which you set at the beginning of the work week. I have learned so many things while working here, mainly that I am more patient than I ever believed I could be. I also have learned to listen better and to deal with all types of personalities with a smile on my face. This job is not for everyone but if you allow it to be, it can be a excellent career choice."
good,Interface directly with customers to provide assistance and resolve problems. Build new accounts and collect on past due accounts.
good,"It was a good company ,but I was with them for two years and I only moved up one position with a dollar raise"

good,"rent a center is a retail company, working in the corporate office is very professional atmosphere, fun people to work with, the company cares about their employees."
good,I learned alot about Account Management and Sales at Rent A Center. I learned the values of customer appreciation and respect. I would recommend this job to anyone who's ready for a challenge in the work force. It is a very challenging job and it demands alot of hard work form you.
good,"be able to interact with customers, manage accounts, keep tract with delivery, meet company goals (daily/weekly/monthly/yearly)"
good,Good place to work and long hours friendly company helps people out when they need it good place to rent  to own and get what you need for your house that make it nice
good,The people in the department are great. Executive management could make themselves more available to get to know their employees and what exactly their jobs entail.
good,Begins by opening the store and doing an overall check of inventory. Then by 9 doing a call through of my route and then after that making runs to past due accounts homes. At the same time making deliveries and pickups along the way. End the day with another call through and running locals that are past due also.
good,"Pay sucked, healthcare was over priced, hours and days are not too bad. I'm not going to trash the company because the Assistant Manager and Sales Manager experience was priceless.  Good job to start out with and work your way up from CAR to Management."
good,rent a center is a good job up to a certain point. it does pay good and you do make money since you work a lot of overtime but it is also a very stressful job. there is no life/ work balance since you always are at work. sales goal are ridiculous un achievable.
good,"Job is ok. Very stressful at times. Management is ok. Good thing about it is 1lunch, bad part of it is low pay. If your looking for a job to be outdoors and labor , this is the job for you."
good,"I started out as a sales clerk and the opportunity to learn the different roles  available in each store.  Interaction with the customers was very rewarding, getting to know someone and fulfilling the needs and/or wants."
good,"The job is physically difficult and demanding, the stress from the customer is unbearable sometimes... the company its self is fair with employees. The hours are long but the pay is worth the hours"
good,Working for this company there is no work life balance - They change your schedule at the drop of hat and expect you to stay and work until 9pm while your store closes at 7
good,"I started as a customer account representative. Overall after my last job this one seemed like a nice upgrade to my budget and work experience. Over time it became stressful as the turnover rate was really high. I always ended up doing other people's jobs and always went the extra-mile to close sales and make sure merchandise was well delivered and set up."
good,Job was good and fun.  It did have some down times but was fast paced most of the time.  Most of the mgrs. are fun and good to work for and the hours were pretty nice for things to do with family as well.
good,"Work is fair and easy for the most part, the biggest downfall and reason for my leaving is you are required to work every Saturday always. You will have one day off in the week. Either a Tuesday Wednesday or Thursday and Sunday off. You work from 10 to 7 so basically the entirety of your day."
good,"Just a very hectic and stressful job, no matter what position you work. It would be a ok job for a single person willing to work hard, but not ideal for a family person"
good,"The job requires effort and work.  Don't attempt it if you don't like manual labor, (moving furniture, appliances) heavy lifting, working in all types of weather.  "
good,It is actually a good company to work for if you have no children and no life. You are forced to work EVERY holiday and be under pressure during the holidays to meet sales goals you literally have no time with your family Rent A Center will be your life and your family.
good,Could use better management. Paid sick time and vacation. No work life balance. Shows favoritism. Everyone has to meet certain standards(not a problem). Overal its an okay place to work as long as you dont have a family.
good,"I reluctantly took a job at RAC during a time of economic down turn.  My overall perception and opinion of the company was actually improved after I worked for them.  The job itself was a mix of physical and office work.  I always perceived that these type of businesses were just taking advantage of the poor and ignorant, but I was surprised to see that wasn't the case.  The company is just renting out inventory with the option to own after renting for a long period.  The company goes out of it's way to disclose exactly what the terms of the rental agreements are.  They do not try to trick the customer in any way.  The pay and benefits for this company are somewhat lackluster but are better than most any retail company you will go to work for."
good,"Good pay and benefits for the area. Above average management. Sometimes the stress can outweigh the pay. Advancement opportunities in most cases. Met some great coworkers. One in particular, that's dearly missed."
good,"There are long hours with the company, many of the stores with locations that are in hostile environments. Dealing with the sort of customer base is stressful."
good,They are very flexible with time will let you set your own schedule. Get benefits and good lunch breaks. Not a fast paced environment. Just have to call people all day
good,theres always something you have to do if your not a team player it makes the job alot harder not just on yourself but the rest of the crew. you learn alot of important skills for future jobs. the workplace is difficult you never have a moments rest if you want to do your job right. hardest part is the demanding expectations there is always a goal that the company wants you to hit and if the rest of your team doesn't help well your not going to enjoy being there for too long
good,"working here was ok, I was always at work with early mornings and late nights. its hard for someone with a family and you never get weekends off. its more of a life style and not a job."
good,It’s was fine until my manager relocated me because I was going for the C.A.R position but Got tricked into going because my boss lied and said I was get to Indianapolis and that wasn’t the case at all
good,"You work roughly 45 to 50 hrs a week, if you have school age children, the only time you see them is before school and before bed. You get 1 Saturday off a quarter, not enough"
good,"Rent A Center has help develop my skills in collection, sales and management skills.  RAC has daily and weekly goals for collection and sales that is strictly in force.  One difficult task is finding the right balance between collection and sales. RAC has great incentives for managers who grow their business. RAC has a fast pace working environment and demanding."
good,"Overwork low compensation.,Lack of communication, Not true to their word.  Diversity is a given in the company.  Sometimes ;your work may be overlooked."
good,"Can be a dangerous environment in the repo area of the company. Sales is interesting due to the fact that you get the opportunity to meet all different types of families. You get polite, rude, even temporarys."
good,Work life balance was the poorest part of working for the company. They expect DM's to be in call 7 days a week and work no less than 6 days a week. Pay for entry level positions was not competitive with local area therefore we had to take under qualified people and attempt to train them up.
good,"great people to work with "
good,There were many happy experiences while working for this company. There were promotion opportunities for those who sought to advance and benefits that exceeded expectations as well.
good,"Working here was not a bad experience, I like fact that you could move up with in the company and when I got hurt on the job they were willing and very helpful throughout the whole process."
good,Its a gif job but the internal politics are to be desired.  They tend to disregard the staff and do a lot of restructuring that effects the visitors directly and there positions
good,"Due to the work schedule ,you have no time for a life 9 am to 8 pm "
good,Is a good work place but  not good pay rate. The pay scale is low compare with the role and responsibilities in a management position and the amount of money that the store manage daily.
good,"In this company, you'll find that you never have quite enough time to get to all the tasks assigned to you. This can be a benefit or a hindrance depending on the type of worker you are. If you like a consistent level of work, and don't mind slowly completing several tasks piecemeal over the course of a few days, this place is for you. If you are hyper-focused and need to get one thing done at a time, and to do it well, then I would stay away."
good,"Great job for fast advancement. However, there is no work / home equality. You can put in 50-60 hrs a week and sometimes you get your second day off.."
good,I enjoyed it while I was there for the most part. Some customers can get a little agitated when confronted about late payments. The Atmosphere was good. Learned about new products and how to install them and maintain them.
good,Be prepared to do it all sales clean drive long hours decent benefits job growth is available .. must pick up merchandise if customer doesn't pay long hour
good,I worked for RAC for many years had ups and downs but overall I would work for them again I worked from CAR to SM and had a rough DM but got a better one but my store was then closed.
good,"the atmosphere of  each store is dependent on the managers attitude "
good,"Very fast paced, and long hours. Hard to balance work and home life. Has perks, just very demanding. There is room for advancement, must be willing to relocate."
good,"be prepared to not have a life, might as well move in the back of the store because you will live there aand have no home life. everything is based off of that company and they do not care about your home life"
good,"Typical day at work consists of me assisting customers and co-workers with escalating issues to the proper Tier 2 department or providing first-call resolutions and documentation. What I have learned so far from being with the company is time management is key to making sure that every caller is taken care of. The management is nice, but there are some things that need improvement in regards to employee morale. The hardest part of my position is making sure the after-call work is done in a timely manner so that I can go straight back to taking another call. The most enjoyable part of my position is getting to my my co-workers, and that our desks are not completely boxed in like a traditional cubicle you would see in a call center."
good,for someone just starting out this is a good place to get experience but would not recommend this place as a career use it to boost your resume and always keep your options open.
good,Wonderful people working there. Home/ work life balance was the hardest to maintain. A lot of company turnover which made it frustrating at times but awesome teammates.
good,The business is ok but the management is terrible. Some of the coworkers with higher positions really take advantage of their positions like they're higher than you in life.
good,"If you can manage the time given in a day at RAC, this could be a great company to work for. Great pay and Incentives. Work life balance can be rough."
good,Great place to work. Other employees are terrific to work with. Hard to balance home and work life. Compensation could definitely be better for working conditions.
good,This job is not for everyone heavy collation practices. that will make you hate your job.  you will be calling people all day to pay there bill also you will be there friends and family.
good,Some good company sponsored events....sales enviroment...can be curthroat somedays....always needing sales and cold calling customers...very strict collection standards
good,it was good pace to work.  Good pay and good benefits.  The hours of operation has changed since I worked there.  The hrs I had to work was very hard on the family life. The days off changed as well.
good,"Working with Rent a Center has had it perks. You gain experience with both sales and collections. The downside is that you are constantly mixing the two on a consistent basis. One day you are the good cop when selling to a customer, the very next day you are the bad cop when trying to collect rent from the customer. It's always stressful when you have to collect merchandise from individuals who cannot pay you right then and there because there's no payment grace period with this company."
good,"I enjoyed working for RAC. I was taught how to do sales calls, cold calls, work the register and sell. It was a great work experience but bad management."
good,Hi stress environment. Collections take priority over sales. customers get rough at times. marketing is another major role along with telemarketing. heavy lifting is required
good,It is a fast pace environment some days. Lot of hours worked plus weekends. I did however learn a lot as a manager working there and very thankful for the opportunity.
good,"Job advancement is great.  Being highly competitive and self-starting can take you a long way in this company. With success in store growth comes more money.  Really, the only thing holding anyone back from making a good sound living is themselves.  What makes it challenging was the collection of money.  The business model works extremely well, however when relationships build between customers and employees the processes can easily break down.  When customers are allowed to make payments based on their particular needs, the store creates a problem that generally ends the relationship.  Stick to the program and you will be successful."
good,"Good place to work if you can handle trying to get 200 or more customers to pay their bills on time. Great co-workers. Just a good place to work, benefits were good."
good,"The rent to own business is not for everyone. This business involves delivery and set up of furniture, appliances, and electronics. It also involves servicing the product and collections of the product when necessary."
good,"good job when your in your early 20s with no wife and kids. pay is ok if dont have family, but every position is required to do all jobs and assistant manger basically do everything."
good,"Great corporate culture, but the mission statement is not accurate for how the business operates."
good,they need to listen to the employees opinion to make thing go smother. extended the lunch  break at 45 minuets. hard part is to try to collect on a Saturday and deliver stuff upstairs.
good,"Spent the day assisting customers, setting up store front and doing collection calls. Deliveries were difficult depending on the type of furniture, appliance, or electronic that was being delivered or returned."
good,This job wasnt bad. But it wasn't the best job out there. Very little room for advancement. And the hours were horrible. I only got on average 20 hours a week
good,"typical day includes handling customer complaints and motivating employees,  Listening to and reviewing calls with employees,  Hardest part of the job is not being able to get off the night shift."
good,"The lack of knowledge by Upper Management and Corporate office of the consumer makes working for the company undesirable. There is a huge disconnect between employees at the Corporate and store level. Thus resulting in poor training, lack of organic growth, and a unhappy work environment for most employees"
good,"Working at Rent A Center as a manager you are required to work 47 hours weekly. The hardest thing about the job the schedule. Your day starts at 9am and ends around 8pm. The things i enjoyed the most about the job were my loyal customers, Helping others finance items for their household, Picking that set that they love and making it affordable. My co workers were amazing, very respectful and obedient. The management is firm but friendly and understanding."
good,"You just never know how your day was going to be, What craziness may come through those doors or the phone. They have plenty of overtime."
good,Some days are better than others but you always lifting no matter light our heavy. Your health is always at risk I recommend to wear back brace knee brace and make sure you get a good night's rest.
good,"the people here are great and fun to be around. they truly are a charismatic bunch I think that this company will be around for a long time because of them,"
good,"The company is very big and focus 100% in profit. Cares little about promotions."
good,"Great employer. Not a lot of room for advancement within the company. Great benefits, Great management. All in all a very good place to work."
good,"Long hours equal good pay, not much of a quality of life balance. Very strict numbers run situation. long hours and 6 day weeks, low pay rate to start, but if you work promotions are available"
good,"The job was a very physical job, but I enjoyed my coworkers... They pay was great, but the hours were long and we often stayed late."
good,the better you look the more you will do and work. the managment is qestionable at best. people that have no understanding of their  postion or worth having athority over you is agrovating.
good,review numbers from previous day and review numbers that we want to hit that day and discuss it with employees and easiest part of the day is achieving those numbers
good,"Not what I thought it would be.  Not what I had expected, This was not the job for me. It is a  good company overall just not what I was led to believe that job would be."
good,"This job wasnt the worst, and probably not the best for most people. Its just best for people whom dont have a family or wife to go home to, due to the long hours during the week, and working on sat. If they made shorter shifts, perhaps 2 shifts it would be alot better, I learned alot, cleaned alot and met people from all works of life. I had the best coworkers, and DM. He was tough, but thats how you have to be in this industry.Pay was good as well"
good,"the company is awesome. provides great benefits, 401k, health, disability etc. however it becomes stressful when it comes to collections and payments. you have to deal with dishonest customers on a daily basis sometimes becoming irrate and the only thing you are trying to do is your JOB. sales are pretty easy you will need great persuasive skills because the merchandise is priced at a high value. small staff you become very close to because you work more than 45 hours a week with them."
good,"Working here gave me a steady schedule, but limited family time. With only 2 days out of the week off, it put a strain on my home life. Almost no social life with this job."
good,With this company you kept very long work days and work 5 days a week. It is a very small personnel staff at the different locations. Everyone helps each other to achieve the common goal as a unit.
good,This company moved from Wichita to Texas.  This company did a lot of tracking of your out put. Which was not fair comparing to other employees out put.  Some of the paperwork  came in already coded to the correct account to be charged.  Thus making the other persons out put looking better because they did not have to take the time to look up store #'s and GL accounts to charge a bill to.
good,"Typical day was calling customers, doing deliveries, making sales calls and picking up merchandise. Running people if they fail to make payment on time."
good,"I liked the physical aspect of the job and keeping busy.   I liked being able to help customers get the products they need/ wanted for their family.  I did not like calling past-due customers (and references, if necessary) for payment, especially when they were more than a  month late on a weekly renewal...and had moved/changed their number. I did not like some of the ""shady"" things that some managers did to attain company standard/goal numbers."
good,"A typical day for me started off with phone calls to overdue accounts. Later, we would get ready for any deliveries or help with sales on the sales floor. I would also do things like clean up returned merchandise, set up new stock, or make house visits to customers that could not be contacted via phone. The end of the day would include calls again to late customers. I learned how ti use a customer database on a computer as well as sales experience. My co-workers were enjoyable people but the manager was young and inexperienced as well as a bit immature. The hardest part of the day to me was phone calls to late customers. Some of the customers could get rather defensive as well as hostile. The most enjoyable part of the day was deliveries because we got to get out of the store."
good,I am a Customer Account Representative for Rent-A-Center. I manage customer's renewal payments and help them to make sure their payments are on time. I also deliver and pick up merchandise to and from customers. While I enjoy delivering product to customer's houses; it is always hard to have to take it from them if they can not afford it. My favorite part of my job is being able to interact with my customers and build professional relationships with them. The unfavorable side of the business is the collection aspect.
good,"Excellent place to work with a lot of people making you feel welcome, if they paid more id happily work there again!"
good,"A typical day starts with you going over the Daily Activity Planner, or DAP, independently before starting on call-thru of your route. This usually consists of calling past due customers, but you will also have same day dues as well. The calling can be extremely boring, as most of your delinquent customers will not answer, or just bullcrap with you. It can be difficult when you first start because you don't realize how bad your customers are essentially running you over, but after your route doesn't close for a few weeks you will make the necessary adjustments and close or find another job. After the route is called, you take your lunch (which is only 30 minutes) then begin your deliveries and service calls for the day. During your down time, you will answer phones, assist on the sales floor, assist with showroom cleanliness, clean and refurbish returned merchandise, take payments, etc. You never really go without having SOMETHING to do, which is good as it passes the time well. After the last delivery, usually around 5pm, you call your route again. After that, print out run cards and hit the streets. This is the best part of the job, in my opinion, as you are truly working on your own and don't have to worry about somebody breathing down your neck. It is also the most out of the ordinary aspect of the job as well, seeing as how you spend a lot of time knocking on doors and picking up merchandise, which at times can tug on your conscious. After running, you return to the store, enter notes in the computer, drop merchandise back into inventory, print tags, clean and go home."
good,Work long hours a week. Decent pay just hard to juggle everyday life and work while being employed there
good,"under paid ,heavy work bring stuff up to the 2nd,3rd,4th floor sometimes having only a day to recover and go back to work and do the same thing again is very tough they ask for too telling and pay way too little there is no enjoyable time here sorry to say."
good,I started to work at rent-a-center in my hometown. I always wanted to serve in the military and I took that opportunity. Not a bad company to work for at all.
good,"This is a good company, if you don't have any kids and you are focus on your career."
good,"a good company to work for, I just need a better paying job that will take care of me and my family."
good,"There is always something to do , goals to hit, people to call, things to clean . The day is never slow . If your looking for promotions they are available with hard work ."
good,Working for RAC was rewarding but to demanding. The pay was excellent but they expected you to sacrifice to much of your personal life.
good,was a good company to work for. but when it came for time off for vacation it wasn't easy to get approved.
good,"Great place to work on your people skills while managing accounts and store guidelines"
good,I dont't want to speak ill of the company. I worked here because at the time I needed employment and they were hiring.
good,"Not the best company to work for but it was fun sometimes. Fast pace environment with a day thats usually never boring always something that comes up that you have to adjust the day. I definitely learned to speak up and push back on dealing with customers and or management. Good job for someone starting out that wants to get their feet wet and gain experience across the board.(sales, management, inventory, customers service etc)"
good,I was in charge of overall operations and training of my location. monthly P&L reports putting together employee schedules and delivery routs. sales and marketing for location
good,Management was decent here had some good and bad managers. Learned how to complete budget reports and how to handle each individual customers needs. The coworkers worked together as team for the most part with minimal problems. The hardest part of this job was learning how to handle customers complaints and getting them to pay on time. The most enjoyable part was meeting new people.
good,"The best rent to own company in the business. Great room for advancement if you are a hard worker, follow the processes they have in place and like to work long hours. If you have a great district manager you have got it made. If you have an absentee district manager you are screwed."
good,Great place to work for the only down side of the job is the daily phone calls and constant calls from the district manager asking if sales were given or gotten by specific employees. Nice work environment to have been apart of the team its just a very demanding job that requires alot of patience and calls given out on a daily basis.
good,"Overall, Rent-A-Center is a fine company to work for. If you are accustomed to working 50 hrs per week or more, and do not mind working Saturdays, its not a bad career."
good,Typical day consists of:
good,A typical day at RAC daily paperwork and am/pm call to customers.
good,As a Store Manager my day consists of many duties. These duties include managing a credit and sales assistant and two account managers. Also responsible for analyzing the budget and maximizing my bottom line profit. I learned a great deal from Rent A Center and I have been promoted several times. It just has become time to move on because I feel that the job leaves me with no time to spend with my Family.
good,"Hard to balance work and life working 50+ hours a week, no holidays to start and salary is slightly below where I believe it should be."
good,I enjoy working for the company and I enjoy the staff that I created for myself. The job pays well and has good benefits.
good,"I learned to be time efficient due to multiple deliveries, stay calm under pressure with unhappy customers and to find solutions to better they're shopping experience."
good,"Does not support employees or management, Regularly changes guildline to suit the situation in their favor. Hours of operation are very prohibitive to life outside of work"
good,I was good at my job. I always hit my goals every week. My manager always praised me for having great numbers. My huge downfall about this job was i was at work from 7- 9 pm with only Sundays off. It was difficult for me to take a long weekend off. I work every single Friday and Saturday. I had no family time.
good,"Es muy buena empresa hay crecimiento y 2 días de descanso a la semana, sólo que el sueldo es un poco bajo"
good,This job is very demanding. No time to really have a life. If you have kids it’s really not the job for you. The hours are long but the pay is decent you always got overtime.
good,"The job can be dirty since you are going into peoples houses and lives. Hours are steady and not a terrible part time position, paid weekly. Spend some time working by yourself, so self-motivation is a must."
good,"company is taking a different turn than when I worked there."
good,"My hours are vary between 9am and 8pm. I usually work 9-11 hours a day with a 1 hour unpaid lunch. I was given training in driving Rent-A-Center's delivery truck as well as basic training in loading and delivering merchandise. Sometimes, we have to drive to stors in other cities to deliver/pick up merchandise from there. I'm also in charge of managing customer's accounts there and contacting past due accounts by both phone and in person at their homes. The job itself is Ok, but with the hours there, it does make it somewhat difficult for planning activites at home. I enjoy doing the driving and delivering merchandise but I don't enjoy dealing with past due customers. Some customers can be very difficult to deal with, especially those who don't care if they're late and pay whenever they please. One issue I have with the job is there isn't enough communication between workers. Some workers/managers will contact a customer, but not note their acct to say they've already spoken to them. So when I contact the same customer, they get upset because they've already had the same conversation and makes me look foolish because I didn't know it had already been taken care of. I'm currently employed there, but I'm looking elsewhere for work for a few reasons. One is my life is currently unable to work for medical reasons and I need something that pays better. Another is there are rumors of several Rent-A-Center stores closing and I don't feel like my job is safe."
good,"When you work with a good team, the day seems to go smoothly and efficiently. Its very stressful at times dealing with different customers and trying to help them understand whatever issue they're dealing with."
good,I would arrive at work at 8 and make the that we would have enough employees to cover the daily activity planner. Next I would make sure all the paper work was done the company can be hard to work for depending on management. The best part of the job would be that you develop a relationship for years.
good,"Loved my job, I was just in a poor growth area, I gave it my all regardless. Would do it again, I love a challenge. Just wish it would have been under better circumstances, other than trying to downsize the store and expecting more growth. A little more support would have done the job, instead of the negativity coming from my peer."
good,Great for young adults who are new to the workforce.  Rent a center helps develop communication skills and customer appreciation. Rent a cent can be a pretty laid back job and not to stressful.
good,A TYPICAL  day for me is loading customers order and making sure the delivery is very successful and making sure the customer is satisfied with work and how the delivery went.
good,"Great job just sucky hours to work, I'm a mom of 2 so it sucked having to be away from your children more than you already are with them in school. That was my only problem."
good,"A typical day depending on your job may require you to sell your products and services, deliver or pick up products, or chase down payments from delinquent accounts."
good,Was a delivery truck driver Basic job for basic pay expect to move big couches by yourself long hours managers will try to tell to take days off when accumulated to many hours. I work near Baltimore so most stores I picked up furniture from was hood as heck most storws have  about 5 people and don't stay long wouldn't recommend this as long term just something to get you on ya feet
good,The job isn't that bad But they ask for a lot. I really enjoyed my managers and the people I worked with. Sales sales sales is the name of the games for some and credit credit credit for others. this job all depends on your location and what store your in.
good,It was a pretty good place to work that was not relatively difficult but it was a very physically demanding job if you did not use your tools and environments carefully.
good,The people at the company were dedicated to doing the best job possible in a difficult and competitive environment.  Instability in Sr Management made that task even tougher.
good,"Too much instability with the corporation.  As the economy flourishes, the need for a rent-to-own business diminishes.  They are trying to sell pieces of the business and in all appearances, it would seem that they will be outsourcing IT jobs very soon."
good,"I loved working here. But the pay was horrible. Never received bonus, paid time off nor sick leave. "
good,Management was great but advancement opportunities and pay were a low. Part time only for delivery but in all we made the company run. Delivery drivers are very unappreciated at this company.
good,"but i did  like  most of the  people i worked for  they did promote from "
good,It's not a tough job but sometimes can be mentally stressful. There positives and negatives to every job. This job can be wonderful and at other times be downright miserable.
good,you start off the mornings by turning on the t.v and cleaning the windows. I learn how to communicate with the customers. some manager are great. the hardest part is keeping time of the schedule on time. the most enjoyable part of the day is when your in the office taking a break and talking to the coworkers
good,The work was decently hard and difficult on my back but overall it was an amazing work environment and very accommodating with family emergencies/vacations. I was fortunate to have a great boss and great coworkers.
good,"Had a good culture and great management. Downsides were mandatory 8 hours of overtime per week and lower compensation. This job is good for someone without kids, who wants to move up in a company."
good,"50+ plus hour weeks and very little to no chance to relax on the job. When you're on the job, you're ON THE JOB. If you don't plan on not doing anything but sales once you walk in the door, don't even bother. High stress, high pressure sales job."
good,"trabajar en equipo, capacidad de lidarar un grupo de cambaceo"
good,"The best part of RAC, is that they only promote from within.  The turn-over is so high that there are always advancement opportunities."
good,I don't feel that family and balance in life is rent a center's number one philosophy.  Everyone in expendable.  The money was good so I stuck it out as long as a could.  Burn out was the untimate result.  As a divisional manager I oversaw 83 stores in 5 states and was rarely home.
good,I enjoyed working with rac.  Plenty of room to grow and plenty of support and involvement from above. The collection part can be a little intense and discouraging however ultimately I enjoyed my time there.
good,"Usually a fun environment, depending on the co-workers. Very much business driven, not much of life outside of work. Very easy to move up in the business."
good,"This is a great job and place to advance, as long as you can take it. Due to the nature of the business here, only the strong survive and you must be able to deal with people; all kinds of people. As long as you can stand the long hours at times, high demand of productivity when it seems like ridiculous goals, and often times being short staffed. You can go above and beyond here. And the pay isn't bad either."
good,"I personally liked working at rentacenter, it was very fun. i learned a lot about retail. Sales, collection, data entry and a few other important things about working and keeping safe personal info."
good,"Manage several hundred accounts"
good,"morning meeting to discuss the goals of today. from that meeting, depending if you are the sales or account manager that  determines your next steps of the day. the account manager is responsible in making sure that two rounds of collection calls are done daily, while the sales manager focuses on making sure the right amount of sales calls are done to generate business. This job is very good on developing it's co workers to be able to do any job due to having to adapt and learn different things from a business standpoint. The co-workers are great and focus on ensuring that the customer's needs are taking care of. The hardest part of the job is the work-life balance. In order for a co-worker to feel like he/she is wanted and appreciated, they must have some type of work-life balance to give the mind, body, and spirit a chance to recharge and continue doing great work for an organization. The most enjoyable part of the job is having the ability to help a customer get a little piece of happiness that they may not have gotten due to various reasons. Just seeing their faces as they obtain items that they never probably thought they could obtain. Customer service is everything."
good,"Very long 50 hr work weeks, not very good life work balance. Pressure on sales to hit numbers or you could loose your job, you become ok with ripping customers off just to hit your numbers not to lose you job."
good,"Working with customers to identify their needs.  Learned management skills along with payroll, budgeting, staffing, pencils and projections.  Hardest part of the job was really just staying organized with all the sales that were taking place.  Most enjoyable part of the job was the overall fun atmosphere."
good,"It was a great job. I have a great position, as Sales Assistant Manager I was able to work on getting sales and getting the store rent ready. After a I learned to do so much work, it was hard to keep track of what I was supposed to do according to my job requirements and what I was supposed to do because I was told to. It was very stressful, they focus so much on delegating tasks that they almost forget that that person has responsibilities that they have to get done on top of what they are told to do."
good,Day at Work get your paper work done review everyone production from the previous day make correction if needed. What I've learn is to multi task quickly. Co-workers are great but they are times that we needed to keep it professional. The hardest part balancing your personally life with business life. The most enjoyable parts the people and different personalities that you meet.
good,This is an extremely viable company that gave me an opportunity. I worked my way up to  management within six months. All of my Assistant Managers were eventually promote to Store Managers.
good,I enjoyed driving the truck and vans to help my customers.I enjoyed having a employee account and being able to buy stuff brand new at a discount and a low payment deducted from my check.
good,"If you are looking for a job that is fast paced and has a great starting pay rate this is for you, but if you dont like long hours and lifting throughout the day then this may not be the job for you"
good,Cool place to work. A workplace where you can venture out and learn new things. Teaches you good customer service skills.
good,"Typical day at work was mainly busy, customers in and out, answering calls and managing a daily activity planner."
good,If you have a family i would not recommend working this job. I work long hours and I am a student. For the amount of work that I am given the pay is definitely unacceptable.
good,"Flexability was paramount. Honed excellent phones skills as an Account Manager. I was allowed freedod to create my own plan for weekly goals. Some of the best people I ever worked with worked at Rent-A-Center. As an Assistant Mananger of Collertions I was exsposed to many different type of customers, which allowed me to expand my abilities to solve customer problems."
good,"This is a place that can be very laid back. Some of the issues, Management can be a little flip-flop. But as long as you do your job its not an issue"
good,Working for rent-a-center was great. I had a very good manager who was easy to get along with. Which made the job fun to be there. The customers were difficult sometimes .
good,"Great job if you're single and/or have no life. Weaken your back. "
good,"Short staffed. "
good,"Typical day approving employee purchases, answering phones,checking/answering emails,hit the gym on break. Some coworkers were professional. Hardest part of the day was wrapping up the work load:) The most enjoyable part is how relaxed the atmosphere is."
good,overall ok experience but way too many hours....building great relationship with customers was great....direct managers were great in helping and training.
good,I enjoyed hiring and training staff as well as all facets of operational management.  The negative was that the company was not as customer focused as they state.
good,A typical day at work is enjoyable I love working with the customers and my co-workers I learn new things about new products all the time I meet new people daily I get to hear about their life stories the good and the bad I like being able to help them to afford things they may not be able to obtain otherwise. The hardest part of the job is a work/life balance.
good,"*A typical day at work consist of a number of things from making sales and collects calls, inter-acting with customers, to delivering merchandise in a timely fashion. "
good,"Great coworkers, alot to heavy lifting, customers who don't think about entryway size when wanting certain merchandise.  Credit management really hard to manage when some customers feel entitled to don't care they owe money for merchandise.  "
good,A typical day at work consist of but not limited to:
good,"Delivering Furniture, the hardest part of this job is trying to collect payments on accounts after they go in collection for non payments."
good,Un dia tipico:
good,"A typical day at Rent A Center would be gaining customers and account management. Every person that comes into the store is a potential customer and we treat them as such. I have learned a lot from how to get the sale and overcoming objections from customers to managing the customers accounts and payments, product knowledge through various vendors, and company policies. I am assistant manager and manage one customer account representative so I make sure he's handling customers with the utmost respect. I make sure all deliveries are on time as scheduled, all inventory are rent ready, show room floor is rent ready, and every single person that comes into the store know that we at Rent A Center want their business. My co-workers are like family. We back each other up; it's like they say ""one band,one sound.""The hardest part of the job is telling a customer they aren't approved because they don't have the income to support their purchase. The most enjoyable part of the day is when I get those customers that ask for me personally because it shows that they appreciate my service and respect me as their account manager and sales leader."
good,Contacted our account holders in regards to bills and new merchandise delivered furniture and appliances. Had good work relationship with other staff hardest part of the job was the collection process when someone didn't want to pay and didn't want to return merchandise. The best part of the day was knowing I hit my number goals
good,"Working for this company for past 4 years has been a great experience.I have learned how to be more of a team player learning that if we work together we can get more work accomplish.Some of my job duties is to oversee store production daily ,collection accounts,make routine house visits,deliveries and sale calls.Working with my co-workers is great we all get alone and work great together.The hard part of the job is wanting better advancement in the company.Best part of this job is dealing with people and selling new and used products"
good,"come in and sometimes help customers in the lobby showing furniture or helping with paying accounts. Working with my co-workers was fine I only worked with a handful of people. The weather was hard delivering could be raining, cool, hot or muggy."
good,"Always busy. Anawering phones, calling your route, driving to customers house's, delivering merchandise and sales."
good,"Sales asstisant, driver, mover, make sales. That was a really good job, I just had to move to a new area and change careers."
good,"Great team work, nice work environment, advancement opprotunites are there"
good,"Your either making phone calls ( collections or sales), making a sale on the showroom floor, of making improvements in the store. Constantly on your feet. A lot of heavy lifting, couches, tv stands, large flat screens, etc. The most important part of the job is customer service. It is a must."
good,Diverse community of people .from different backgrounds.great benefits with good compensation company outings and dinners .multitude of different company shirts .fun place
good,"Great co workers,nice environment, the pay could have been better for the work that was done..small community and nice items.. the management was great and great teamwork.."
good,It was an ok job to have. They gave me an opportunity to make $15 an hour which is the most I've made in the civilian world but it is a dangerous job.
good,"Great place to work for good compensation, but get ready to not have a life. No life /work balance long hous due to the fact of only 4-6 employees per store"
good,"If you have a good store manager then your life is easy, and the work place can be fun. However if your store manager cannot adequately do their job your life can be a nightmare."
good,this company had me always moving with just enough down time to not get exhausted. multitasking was fun and necessary. i enjoyed my job here as a manager.
good,Staff was wonderful. High call volumes daily with irate customers. Did a lot of floor activities. A lot of changes occurred as you become seniority. Average place to work.
good,"Overall, my experience with Rent A Center has been pretty good. The hours aren't always desirable for someone who has a family. There are opportunities to promote within the company."
good,"It was a rent to own furniture, appliance, and electronic store. I sold, delivered, serviced, and reposessed furniture, appliances, and elecronics. We were a close knit group of co-workers that got along witg one another exceptionally well."
good,"its ok if you like heavy lifting and being micro managed. a typical day starts with me reading the schedule, and then the manager tells you the schedule as if you didnt know already. i learned how it feels to be micro managed and untrusted."
good,"It's rent-to-own. At its best, you really are helping people who can't get credit to live a decent life. At its worst, you are taking advantage of people with few other options. "
good,"Worked 48 hrs a week, making it hard to balance life and work."
good,you will see your kids grow before your eyes. No work life balance. pay is not worth the stress. Your job is threatened everyday.  You will be at work from sun up to sun down. job security is a scary topic. advancement is easy. coworkers are good to be around. they become your family because you see them more than your own. time off work is non existent except for Sunday.
good,Good place to work but there is not a work life balance and you work on the weekends. Management is great though. The pay is ok but the raises are good
good,"During my time at Rent-A-Center my typical work day consisted of running the store, prepping the sales floor with merchandise and updating paperwork and dealing with regional and district conference calls. I would update and review customer files and operate the credit department, which included but was not restricted to collections/delivery, sales, account management, scheduling, and customer service. I learned while working here how to maintain composure under stress, how to deal with collection processes, how to update and maintain large amounts of files. Management was not always the best as they sometimes set ridiculous goals that were impossible to reach. As each department was pitted against each other. THe workplace was like working in a highly competitive team that majority of the people there were very cut throat and only cared about their goals,regardless of who they threw under the bus to get there. The hardest part was maintaining files and following all local laws in regards to collection processes. The most enjoyable part was helping customers get on point with their payments."
good,Rent to own is not for everyone. I have experienced great customer service and have seen customers at their worst.It seems to me that most customers do not totally understand the financing charge added to their agreement once it has expired its same as cash value.
good,"Retail. My advice to you, don't wait for a pay raise. You probably will never get what you were promised until 10 years later if you're even there that long."
good,"Being this was a rent to own company, i felt that it was a highly stressful environment. As far as coworkers and management, they were all great to work with."
good,"Great coworkers who became family. It is not a light job, it is very demanding.  It is also a place where you have to come in contact with all types of people in attitudes to appearances all in which have to be dealt with the same nonjudgmental way.  They offer great benefits."
good,"Morning collection calls are made, deposits and daily paper work from previous day is done. All electronics are powered and the store is opened."
good,"En cuanto a prestaciones y estabilidad está muy bien solo que hay gerente despota tanto también como gerente regional, mucha presión en cuanto a las ventas un horario muy matado"
good,"Job consisted of a checklist of merchandise to deliver. cleaning the store or making sales calls on slow days. On occasions being sent to collect payments or merchandise. Good teamwork, unless working on your own. A great job if you're a student or single with no children. Good workout carrying merchandise. If business is slow, you get sent home."
good,"other than the normal management things, there is a big push to sell and make sure your collections are on goal."
good,Working and getting the job done. 70% of time you are on the road. Cool customers and cowokers. Great place to work if you are looking for a part time or full time job.
good,Fun work place with hard management. Numbers are most important when it comes to moving forward in the company. The most enjoyable part of the work day is interacting with the customers.
good,"As an assistant manager for this company, I was able to wear many 'hats', and do many different things, both inside and out. It was enjoyable and I liked the people I worked with and for. However, at the end of the day, the service provided by the company and the business model proved not for me."
good,Very Productive and active work days lots great benifits ect Long work hours but great breaks . Great employee discounts on merchandise
good,the management was awesome. they only hire from within the company. promotions are given to the people that are deserving n favoritism.
good,No two days at RAC were the same. Everyday presented a new challenge whether it was meeting new people and trying to hire for Store Teams; Helping with overall turnover and supporting Employees with employee relations and other personnel questions.The challenges never stopped and I enjoyed every bit of it.
good,"On a daily basis I am responsible for maintaining credit for the store by building relationships with customers. Selling merchandise. It is a new store so the majority of the time we are out promoting the store by flyering, door knocking, or visiting apartments. The hardest part of the job is the amount of hours worked, the employees are like a second family."
good,While I worked for Rent-A-Center I enjoyed my job. It was fast paced and we were always on the go. I worked with a great group of people that knew what the meaning of team was.
good,"Route Calls"
good,Organized and constant training. Company offered excellent compensation and benefits.  Excellent rapport with entire team including partner stores.
good,"This job taught me so much about tolerance."
good,"customer service, inventory, sales, new sales, grow business"
good,I had a great time worked well with co-workers manager was involved and was always there for us when we needed help the only thing is that was lacking was communication and customer service.
good,"Rent-A-Center is a great company to work for overall. You work with a team in all fields of the business. Not one employee just does one job. Everyone delivers, collects, calls, and sales. Fast advancement is possible if you are willing to learn and work for it. It is not just a job but a career. You cannot expect to work there just for a paycheck. The ONLY downfall to RAC is the hours. You work 12 hour days 5 days a week if not 6 days a week. Holiday weeks you will not get a day off and you will not ever get a weekend off. There is no such thing as a weekend. You just get Sunday off. It can be a very fun and rewarding career if you make it that way. Employee purchasing is amazing and very convenient. "
good,Call delinquent account holders for due payment. Take payments make sales and deliver furniture/electronic. Repo furniture if need too.
good,"Alot of time away from family, the days are very long, by the time you get home it is time to go to bed and get up in morning for work again."
good,"Iwould ope the store, get the computer running. do the daily bank deposit, make price tags or bundles prices for merchandise, the showroomflor had to look nice at all times, i was responsible roe selling furniture and appliances to the customers, i reviewed the rental agreement with the customers, was in charge of customer files, bank drops, cash drawer audits, and the closing of the store."
good,"The pay is great but the job can get a little hard and stressful at times. Overall I enjoyed my experience with the company. I would recommend the job to someone with a flexible schedule, who is able to work long hours and be on their feet for long periods of time and doesn’t mind lifting from time to time"
good,I liked it there but when we had to get mean with customers when they didn't want to pay and go to there home to repo the merchandise that's part I didn't like most times they answer door with gun in hand so it was kinda scary
good,I was sold on this company because of the amount pay they offered per hour. The job did not offer bonus or commission but allowed the employees to be hired in as full time employees and the opportunity to pick up overtime  hours.
good,"Was a great place to work for if you don’t have a family long nights and won’t get to see them much, but company has great benefits and insurance. Great company to start out with."
good,"My location was fun to work at but there were a lot of politics with management and Home Office."
good,"A typical day at work was waiting on potential customers and contacting current customers. Management was easy to reach when needed but because it was a performance driven company, management could be very pushy at times. The hardest part of the job was contacting customers 3-4 times a day."
good,"Assisted customers and helped them obtain ownership.  Also  assisted coworkers in growth in new positions.  "
good,"Very busy fast paced job. i developed most of my sales and collection skills here."
good,"Dealing with past due account customers and sales. Their is too much stress levels dealing with the way rent a center run their business. Job duties of the day as soon as you come in to work, call past due account customers about 240, run to their house if no answer, sales, preparation of delivery of the customers furniture and delivered their furniture."
good,"the company itself is great, family oriented. the store I worked at was not. had a high turnover, understaff, preference in employees and willing to cover for each others mistakes, not willing to let employees finish with training and succeed in job."
good,the pay at this company is excellent but you have to work hard for it. have to understand the business first in order to start advancing. Its a business designed for low income families
good,A typical day at work was tedious but enjoyable. I learned a great deal concerning sales and management. The workplace culture was fast-paced but fun. The hardest part of the job was being able to settle delinquent accounts. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to interact and meet so many people/family and individuals. I formed relationships that have lasted years.
good,No hay organización ni capacitación de personal falta más capacitaciones
good,Good company but stressful work. Worked 6 days a week for management. Good for a young single person with family. Very hard to have time for out of work life.
good,"Hard work can pay off if you get are in the right place at the right time. This career path is a grind and it never stops. You have daily, weekly and monthly goals and there is pressure like no other to achieve those goals."
good,"A typical day at work consists of collections, sales, deliveries,coaching/training and cleaning. I enjoy working with the public and serving my customers and coworkers from the heart. I have been with the company for almost 4 years and have had the opportunity to take over other stores, just unable to relocate to futher my career with this company. I am in need of a more work/life balance job. We are required to work every Saturday, in which affects my family time. Also, recently the company has made a change to our holiday policy and no longer offers us federal holidays off. I absolutely love my job being a Sales Manager/Store Mgr in Training and have furthered my training as a manager. I am uncapable of performing some parts of this job such as moving appliances, furniture, large electronics and very heavy items. I prefer to leave the company due to this and the management that I am currently working under in which, is not displaying leadership skills and likes to make drama at work. I am a very successful 39 year old lady whom would make a great fit for any company. Current position consists of Sales Manager, Store Manager In Training & Lead Assistant Manager."
good,Rent a center is an amazing company. Friendly staff and great District Managers. I have learned so much working for this company.  Very hands on. Working for this company has been very enlightening  and enjoyable.
good,"very friendly environment, there is always a lot of work to be done, assistants and store managers typically work 10 sometimes 11 hour shifts. It was a great job i learned a lot. I only left because i had to."
good,I really enjoyed this job very fun sales atmosphere and this job gave me the opportunity to be creative when it came to sales.
good,i liked it to an extent the hours were hard no time for my personnel life and some people were rude. it could be a lot more fun. but if i could i would work there again.
good,Its a great job for someone that does not have children. You are there from 9am to 8pm m-f with one day off and then 8:30am-6 on saturday with Sunday off.
good,"inventory, manger employees provide customer service. problem solver, collections, answer emails, deal with account management, fix any customer service issues, holding people accountable"
good,"typical day involve checking emails, preparing the registers, merchandising, opening up and closing the store and preparing daily paper work"
good,The new manager is great and is very involved in helping his staff get to where they want to be as long as you do your best. Both sales and the collections department works as one.
good,"A good company to work for with good benefits, but the hours are extremely long and the company is not flexible."
good,Customer Service.  Inventory Control.  Customer Retention.  Adjustments on payscales.  Service Items.  Organize the Daily activity planner (DAP).  Schedule deliveries/returns.  Refurbish merchandise.  Customer Service is the most enjoyable part of job.  Returning of merchandise it the hardest part.
good,Very rewarding salary but extremely long hours in a very stressful environment.  
good,Very good company with great advancement. The money is very good. The hours are lon
good,I liked working there people were nix management was easy to get a hold of pay was fair and hours were a little to long training wasn't that good but overall OK
good,"Worked at repair Center, good work place and Employees.Exelent Benefits, Good communications with Employees. Always got raises every year. Learned new  Repair technics. Sent to Tech. School."
good,"The Rent a Center that I started is located inside Big Sandy Superstore where you could rent to own any of Big Sandy's furniture the workplace was very fast paced and cut throat, it was sales and being in the management position you was responsible for all aspects of the sale. I learned that people can act like a friend and take your job when you are not aware of what is going on. The culture of the workplace was very fast paced and there was qualifications of being financed if you could not qualify for the traditional finance options available at Big Sandy the sales person would bring you to the Rent A Center side and see if we could get you qualified. The hardest part of the job was when no payments were made and the furniture would have to be repossessed and sometimes I would have to take the client to court and not even get the merchandise back. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping people that may not have credit get nice furniture or appliances and make the timely payments and build credit."
good,Rent a center is fun place to work... When you is out on the road going to the customer house you is your own boss.. The mangers is great people an they will work with you..
good,"Challenging position, need to have strong strength on telemarketing, sakes, and collections. Rent A Center is a very interesting place to work, need to be able to work long hours."
good,"Overall, I am extremely grateful for the time I have been employed with Rent A Center. From the bottom to the top, every position, on a store level, allows employees the opportunity to grow. You get to hone and improve your knowledge and experience in several areas, Business, Account management, Sales, Corporate world, customer relations, and most importantly team work."
good,Working for the company was a fairly good experience. Towards the latter portion of my time there I found myself just going thru the motions and not having a desire to go thru the redundancy of the job function.
good,"Rent-a-Center is a good place to work. Supervisors are willing to listen and train. Work can  be hectic, but it's steady. There is always something to do."
good,"Attention to detail in everything that you do there, no family time. Pay is good."
good,"My days consisted of calling Customers and collecting past due accounts as well as possibly working out payment plans. Once moved to the management position, I mainly worked on sales, and inventory."
good,Rent a center is not the career you want. Take a twelve year olds bed from her before christmas and thats how the job is.
good,Rent a Center is an okay place to work and the pay is pretty good but there is no work/life balance. You work every Saturday until 7pm and every weekly until 8pm. You have to arrive at work between 8am and 9am. You never get a Saturday off and it's impossible to spend time with your family.
good,"Everyday I come into work I pull customer files and handle their payments and concerns. I call all past due customers and collect payments. I am also in charge of Sales. I call current and previouse customers to sell merchandise. I am in charge of my own route. The only dislike I have with my current job is the long hours, I am a mother of two and I barely see them, I prefer to be home with them as much as I can but still have a good job. I enjoy what I do as far as clerical work."
good,"Buena opcion de trabajo, el modelo de negocio es muy riesgoso, se debe mantener el equilibrio entre ventas y cobranza pero la cobranza se torna dificil."
good,"Empresa extranjera, podrían tener mejor sueldo, y distribución de actividades."
good,I was promoted after working for 3 months. the soonest amount of time possible to be promoted. Some times you do work for 12 hours and there is a mandatory amount of hours of overtime required for management positions.
good,"I was hired when they decided to make the step into adding a payday loan to the business. I was the manager of the financial side and it was very enjoyable to be able to help people with paying their bills."
good,While I previously worked for RAC I enjoyed it as one of my favorite jobs. Recently went in for another chance to work for them and the regional manager was a complete jerk. I dont know who is running this company now but I have never been more disrespected by anyone in my life.
good,I was an Lead Assistant manager. My co-workers were awesome. I learnes alot about the rent to own business. It was nice working there.
good,"long hours"
good,Maintaining a clean store and replenishing merchandise every morning and making sure everything is good to sell. Making sure you meet all your goals and collections standard every day. Learning your product and your customers and working well with your co workers. Making sure every delivery is on point and satisfy your customer and making sure you leave the customer with a smile on her or his face.
good,I love the job and the people I work with but not a good job if you have a family and children. way to hard to juggle home life and rent a center.
good,"Managing 5 or 6 employees. Interacting with customers and covering/management more than 300 accounts. Overseeing store profits and directing directly with H.R for staffing. Interviewing, hiring, and training."
good,"En lo que respecta mis compañeros de trabajo excelente , mi Gerente y SubGerente de tienda , muy amables , me apoyaron bastate y me hicieron crecer y creer en mi como persona. Es muy difícil trabajar ya que en el Área de Cobranza se batalla mucho con los clientes pues no quieren pagar y no tienen muy claro la idea de que es una Muebleria de Renta. Y en el Área de Ventas es muy difícil , ya que la tienda donde estoy yo hay muy poca afluencia de clientes y aparte el articulo aumenta el doble o mas a Contrato de Renta por lo cual al explicarle al Cte por obvias razones no se compromete , son muy pocos , aparte por la situación actual ."
good,I was unsatisfied with the company's ability to handle serious problems such as harassment and physical threats due to dm being under review and store management change over.
good,Making several phone calls on a daily basis to help collect revenue.Delivery of merchandise and helping on the sales floor.I learned alot about sales and collection from my management team.
good,"Buena, con áreas de oportunidad. se requiere mayor enfoque en la capacitación de todo el personal así como un soporte legal para el área de cobranza"
good,"Good pay/benefits, but industry takes advantage of less fortunate."
good,It is a good place to work with room for advancement. Weekly pay and good benefits. just to many work hours required
good,I would still be giving my %100 all to this company had it not been for me being informally discharged. I learned alot about sales and management from starting as a credit manager to then becoming a sales manager within 3 month time period. I loved the competition and daily goals I had to strive to achieve everyday. It also helped me in managing my life outside of work. I learned to better my people skills and overall to better myself.
good,"it was a great place to work, I enjoyed everything about it except the hours. "
good,Rent a Center is great. Depends on what you can handle. Can you lift and move heavy items on a daily basis. Looking to stay in shape this is the job for you. I love the job its very challenging and exciting. I spend most days on the road delivering items or in the store answering phone calls and taking payments. My favorite part of any day is making sales. The hardest part of my job is not knowing what I'm going to deliver or pick up.
good,working with a good team of career minded people is a great thing. Getting together to problem solve a clients account or working together to get a project done. I have learned to listen closely to all kinda of people from clients to higher management. To go beyond what they are asking for. There are no hard parts to my jobs because i truly enjoy people and problem solving for them. It makes for many happy customers.
good,"Pros- rent a center is a great career starter oppurtunity for those seeking to build and grow with a company. great management, everyone gets treated fairly, great customer service is a plus "
good,"Very busy with sales, collections and great customer service"
good,I love this job. I was able to meet different people every day. The work was hard but I did have fun.
good,"A typical day at rent-a-center requires tons of energy and physical energy, on the other hand if you have the drive and will power its a great place to work."
good,I have a lot of good times working there. There's always something to do. It gets stressful but it worth working there. Traveling to different parts of the city is my favorite part of the job.
good,Normal work day for a sales manger. Clock in verify files. Get paper work for employees to do delivery's through out the day. I learned alot about  telemarketing and collections. The management in my store and my district manger are horrible they do not care about no one other then them selves they will fire you befor taking blame for  there mistake. My manger takes 3 hour lunchs and leaves the store to go shopping for her personal life. Hardest thing about my job is usually around the first with 15 files to be verified and 8 items going out that day along with calling with payments and sales though out the day makes it difficult to do by your self when the store manger sits in her office. Things I enjoy is the pay days it is 50 hours a week. And meeting new people and hearing every one stories and there jobs
good,"this job pushed me to the limit. it was demanding physically for me. i delivered furniture, set up and explained the function of the product customers put on rental. being able to move around all day delivering, doing sales of product so this would make the time go by pretty fast for me."
good,Great career starter with a salary to fit a single person. Not recommended if you have or plan on starting a family. Ok benefits and you do work on Saturdays
good,"Iniciar 30 minutos o 1 hora antes de tu entrada 9 am"
good,"Learned many skills dealing with household furniture and appliances. Very organized and controlled work environment. Co-workers depending on location are very friendly and very helpful with needed work information. Job isnt very hard at all, just very time consuming."
good,"I worked for rent a center for about 4 years, the turn over rate is really high people dont last with that company very long if you can make it 2 years you are considered and old timer. The pay is pretty good you get paid weekly so thats nice, benefits are pretty good as well, you get every sunday off because the company is closed. But you will never get sat off and even if you request it you can get told no and you are even nervous to ask. I worked with company just as a stepping stone in to mangement then moved on to better companys. other then that plan to work a min of 48 hrs per wk."
good,"It was a good place to work as far as bringing a pay check, but the management is no good you have manager that does not know whats going on half the time in his own place that he needs to lead and then he has a lead tech that just is as bad at his job as the main manager, the lead tech is on his phone half the day answering his personal calls instead of helping and assisting the technicians, never wants to help on difficult task only want easy task and then theirs the issue of the lead tech stealing items from the service center."
good,"It was a fast pass, organization skills is a must and the ability to multitask. I learn how to manage my time and team of 8. holding them accountable and thrive for successes. Meet company standards and budgeting the bottom line. "
good,Job consisted of furniture delivery and account management . About keeping up with both deliveries and time management along with refurbishing furniture and sales. My coworkers and managers always held a high standard of excellence and everyone was onboard and were very helpful.

good,Dealing with customers that are paying ten times more for a product and learning how to keep these customers happy.
good,"Rent-A-Center meets a unique niche market of providing products for the home to people who are credit challenged.  As the Sales Manager, I am tasked to driving sales for the entire store through in store sales, telemarketing, saving returns, mail campaigns, canvassing, and developing other marketing approaches.  I also implement and execute corporate sales promotions."
good,I worked here while going to school because they were willing to work with my school schedule and it was a good work environment to learn new things. Good place to work if you know sales and competition.
good,Poor management decisions led to the outsourcing of the entire IT department . Need a complete overhaul of top level management. They were the ones making the decisions
good,"Lack of advancement opportunities, no training but high expectations of their employees. Not much appreciation for the sacrifices made to by the staff. Lack of compensation"
good,"This company is a good place to work and a great place to serve customer service. The clients are All different, and it's a great experience. Going thru three store managers in A span of two years, the sales leads must be strong. And self confident. This job can be stressful."
good,"District manager is not good , never happy with our performance, there is a large turn around because of him and the policy that always change, other then that if dont have a family its great to work here."
good,"My typical day at Rent A Center consist of , calling ,managing, cleaning , delivering and repossessing merchandise. I learned how to safely and neatly pack delivery trucks. Rent A Center management was horrible, we were  micro managed hourly. Rent A Center co-workers worked as team. The hardest part of the job was trying to make someone pay there bill for their merchandise. The best part of the job was being on the road during deliveries or repos"
good,"I was responsible for Sales, Collections, Delivery, Set Up, Service and Recovery of products. I was also responsible for filling spots on floor and making sure older product was sold to make room for newer products"
good,Long hours. back breaking work sometimes with little time off.
good,Good job. Like to promote from within. leaves absolutely no time to have a family life or an active life outside of work.
good,"Setting up your staff to be sucessfull for the day,week,and beyond. However working under a microscope makes all employees uncomfortable. There were 3 district manager changes in 7 months,and each had different values and views to how the same store should run.Differant company values under the former owner Ernie Talley."
good,I enjoyed the people that I worked with at Rent A Center.  The job is very stressful and some of the weekly collection goals are not easy to meet.  The business of product removal can be difficult and sometimes it can weigh on your mentally.
good,Everyday making hundreds of phone calls to collect payments. Stopping by customers homes to collect goods. Cleaning and restoring furniture. Most days are 10hr days.
good,"would greet customers, help in their purchases and receive payments call customers when they were late with payment and help them make their minimal monthly payment"
good,"i had a few great managers that worked well for me. but your work family life balance is horrible, they work you to death and no time for family, eat breath drink dream is all RAC"
good,Rent a Center was a great place to work but the pay wasn't great. The Management was good and wasn't micro managed. The culture of the company was professional and relaxed.
good,"Pick-up & drop-off furniture such as couches, fridges, stoves, washer/dryers and also bedding. Pick-up payments from customers houses & customer service."
good,Need to meet standards weekly and need to have great people skills and not be scars to knock on peoples houses for collection
good,"I enjoy working here, I see a lot of different products. I get to know more people and learn something all most every day. The other employees are fun to work with, we go on deliveries and pick ups together. Some times we have to drive an hour or two together so it is a good thing we can talk."
good,Not a bad place to work when all team members are on the same page with the store's goals. It can be not so great a place when not all team members are working toward a common goal.
good,"As Credit Manager my tasks were to perform skip traces and to find a way to recover or to prevent loss of store merchandise, even managing small claims and or calling for police assistance or their presence when needed. "
good,"Interacting with customers and filing rental agreements"
good,"Typical day is show up and call your past due customer. Depending on how long that takes you will either clean returned appliancs or go to lunch. After you get back you will hav deliveries and or picups. Then you get to go home. Most people complain about the work/life balance being bad. I dont mind it, I come from working in restaurants so getting off at 8pm is amazing."
good,all the days are very routine clean the store in the morning receive some merchandise make debt/sales calls and go on deliveries to customers house where you pit together there merchandise inside of there homes the hardest part of the job ids the deliveries because you never no if the furniture the picked out is going to fit inside there homes the most enjoyable part would be when you can calm down people that are in raged tell them whats going on with accounts in a way they understand and have them bring more business into the store  
good,Delivering merchandise
good,"schedule deliveries,and or payment pick up"
good,Rent-A-center was an ok job. I was independent and I enjoyed my friendly co workers and store manager. I enjoyed being in and outdoors and sales. I enjoyed working with the costumers and helping manage their accounts.
good,"A typical day is calling customers for sales, making sure my show room floor is fully stocked, making sure the deliveries are scheduled and arrive on time, taking payments correctly for our credit department, counting the draw down at night and locking up"
good,promotions are from within company if available and you perform you job above standards. down side is that if you take a promotion there is no relocation assistance to assist you to relocate to new store
good,COMPANY has goals every week you have to hit and customers are crazy and you can be replaced very easy. Upper management constantly stays with stress and taking customers sides
good,There were good days and there were bad days but overall pretty good job love the active Ness and the motivationI also love to helping  Customer is the best way I could
good,It was ok when i got hurt at home i broke my hand and the boss man still had me lifting couches and washier/dryers then i got hurt on my job I did not tell any one I just quit and my supervisor I will never try to work for him again and when i told him i quit he put me down as terminated
good,Great company on the rise with great people in charge. the job itself can be stressful and the hours are long. The scheduling makes it difficult to take time off of work at times. You're either built for it or you're not.
good,company should pay better for the work you.do the store manager did the best to make it fun and enjoyable work place. split days off one week day and Sundays
good,Rent a center provided a semi stable work environment with a chance to promote from within depending on your surrounding cast. It can be a fun and laid back work environment with chances to promote eventually.
good,Overall this is a very good company. This job isn't for everyone and you need tough skin. If you are skilled in sales and collections the job will be good for these type of people.
good,"No tienen en si un sistema de capacitación, al pobre del gerente le cargan toda la mano, la distrital pésima en su trato hay mucho terrorismo laboral, y a la gente que desarrolla e impulsa a otros a crecer los corren o les hacen la vida miserable."
good,"If the district manager would have done his job like he should, I would have stayed. The work was easy, but could turn into a busy day quick. Also lots of driving"
good,"Was not anything more than a job between semesters during college. Enjoyed working there for the most part. Easy job, lots of hours, which was good. Nothing more than temporary job."
good,Being a professional deliver driver is quite exciting. Its a steady fast pace job you always on the go and you get to make a lot of families happy with their purchase.
good,Working at Rent A Center is all about Sales and collections.  Management is only interested in numbers.  If you are not good at sales and customer service this isn't for you.
good,Great place to work if you are dedicated to your own success.
good,"Very relaxed, manager offered competitive initiative to make employees hit company standards. Goal orientied, sophisticated employees. Fast paced on certain days to help company goals."
good,"This is  a huge company, good training and good places to work. The problem is the schedule which is not to favorable and your duties are no safety at all"
good,"Very Male oriented"
good,Really good for single individuals. If you have a family it will be really hard spending quality time. Hours have you here all day. At times you feel like you're doing more than what you get paid for.
good,their are immense duties to perform. From collections to sales to repos. the repos can be very dangerous and its not something for everyone. the customers you encounter contributes to a serious realization of local humanity.
good,The schedule can vary with any position but a set number of hours for any non salaried employee. Longer hours have gotten better over the years. Lunches/Breaks are fit in and never within a set time. If you're a quick learner and willing to put in the time the incentives and pay are worth it. Not always a family friendly job. Upper management/ Corporate expectations set the bar very very high.
good,"i loved interacting with the public and preparing the showroom for potential customers. There was so many different product that we offered that sometimes you could not predict what a customer was looking for,"
good,Fun fast paced job always traveling. Meet lots of new faces everyday. Some freedom & input on how the store should be set up
good,"Management cannot figure out why the average employee only last 18 months and then takes away the promised day off for the 4th of July then gives a different day off ""to spend time with family"" never mind that the families will be working."
good,you work 45-50 hours a week no time for family split days off quick advancement oppurtunities the best part of the job is you get to know your co workers real well and become good friends
good,"A lot of long hard work due to being short staffed, but our team made it work and we were very succesful. my co-workers became family and we remain good friends to this day."
good,Its a fun place to work with delivering furniture and you have a lot of pressure and to make sales. Then you have to counsel people on making payments.
good,working for Rent a center is a good place to work with very little advancement to get the knowledge of sales and collections equally. Advancement is not as quick as you would like based upon the number of stores in the market.
good,"I enjoyed my job, but the relationship with my boss ultimately ended my career there and it wasn't 100% based on my performance."
good,"long work hours, decent pay, with plenty of advancement opportunity."
good,"The pay is slightly above minimum wage to start, must get into management to get a significant pay increase. Hours can be long, as with any retail store, provides decent benefits at a bit higher rates than average. Turnover can be high at times which makes advancement spotty at best. This company is extremely money driven. If your location doesnt profit well enough, you will have upper management on you constantly."
good,"Pay is good but overwhelming work schedule, long hours, busy to slow days. Communication skills, customer service issues. The hardest part of the job will be disclosed during the interview/"
good,"the days at rent a center consisted of nothing really calls, calls and more calls refusing to work with the very customers that pay thier salary. Absolutley no respect for others exspecting everone else to work but yet upper management wants to sit back and do nothing. the hardest thing about it is dealing with employees that want to do what they want when they want. the greatest thing was the benefits"
good,A typical day at Rent A Center started with calling customers and greeting customers that walked in the store. Following the company's sales Technic: introduce your self then ask show and sell I learned that I am good at and enjoy sales even in a store setting it was very helpful that the store manager was willing to take the time to teach and also my co-workers.The most difficult part of my job was collections because I did not like having to take merchandise back from my customers. It is more joyful to give something than to have to take it away
good,I loved working at rent a center! I love the customer service and all my customers. The only downfall is communication between RD/DM/SM. I learned a lot from the company still know how to navigate sims and all programs! Definitely have great advancement.
good,Wasn't my type of work with the debt collection. The deliveries weren't to bad other than the occasional sleeper-sofa up to a second story. Benefits are good.
good,There is no room for growth in this company! You work your assigned job with no future of progressing. Numbers are all that matter! The incentives are a joke and hardly ever giving.
good,Load and unload tractor trailer by yourself in all inclement weather. Long routes for an entire state 20-30 stores depending on the route. 3-4 day work week if you manage time wisely.
good,"Good place for starting out. Part time, no benefits unless you get on full time. Work is easy. I would recommend this to a younger person, or someone that needs extra work."
good,"A typical day starts off pretty consistently with a conference call with the district manager and then a quick store meeting with the manager for a game plan of our day/week goals. It’s a very fast paced environment and the job can be very labor intensive. The workplace generally is very goal oriented regarding sales and collections. I’ve always said that if you have a great staff who supports, encourage, and develops each other, it is a very fun and enriching environment and you will enjoy your time and you will want to work hard but if it’s the opposite, your time employed will become short lived and miserable."
good,"Its very stable job able to advance quick if you are determined.  But is very stressful, very confrontational environment and very long hours. And the balance between home work and life doesn't exist."
good,"The company was great when  I first started I know it sounds like  Cliche. My 2 years with company were great.  I got promoted after 6 months to a Store manager with heated work. Been a sore manager ever since. My company went public n that's when thing went down hill.  Major lay off, cut back,  even changed our raised for every 6 months to yearly. Now I feel like most knowledgeable people have left n it's hard to get what u need from upper management.  You can get OT during summer ppl always call out. Oh and  they hate firing ppl. They only fire you if you don't produce results."
good,"Great place to work, met a lot of new people and learned a lot. very stressful at times. always trying to push sales and credit with minimal intensives for employees."
good,Great Hours you gotta know your customer base and how to organize and do a lot of the store. The managers though weren't too great the expected you to do most of the hard work and you weren't very appreciated.
good,Employer where time management is an absolute must. Does offer great benefits and employee options for self improvement. Will say that hours required at work depends on store location
good,"Rent A Center is a decent place to work with average benefits. The job lacks in the work/life balance department, but it offers good experience and steady pay during an interim period."
good,Compensation was fantastic but hours were ungodly. Worked  days a week starting at 8:00AM and finishing around 10-10:30PM. One was considered a half day in which you worked until 5:00PM. They gave you full control of the P&L and your bonus was based on this. Too achieve the bonus you needed to work the above hours plus. They moved managers from store to store quite frequently and also demoted and promoted them
good,Rent a Center is a great job if you don't have small children.  The work is fast paced and company numbers have to be met.  You have be aggressive in collections and sales and deal with hostile customers who do not want to return merchandise when unable to pay for it.
good,"The company has great benefits, weekly paychecks, but doesn't allow much work-life/home-life balance, as it is retail. Typical day is making collections calls to clear past due accounts, sales, marketing phone calls to generate new business. The workplace culture varies depending on location & staffing. The hardest part of the job is the schedule changes. The most enjoyable part of the job are the weekly paychecks."
good,Once you get to know customers you will get it but manager and district manager are not in the same page. Work schedule is not for a person with a family because you with spend all day and half your weekend.
good,You wprked a lot of hours and sometimes the pay was worth it. But you did miss a lot of your family things cause they are open monday thur Saturday. Some managers were ok as well
good,If not for my issues inside the store. I would definitely do this again. The work can be stressful but when you actually see the happiness in a customers eyes and know you make the difference then it makes it worth whle.
good,Talking to customers on the phone and delivering goods to and from their homes.  Organizing stockrooms and transferring goods from store to store.  Setting up sales and swapping out items for replacements.
good,"Se pueden mejorar muchas cosas en la empresa, hay muchas àreas de oportunidad pero falta apertura para escuchar sugerencias."
good,need more pay shorter saturdays and holidays time in a half. the job itself is a good business experience with a major roll in furthing your career. so yeah go got it
good,"The day went by so slow at RAC . Making cold calls was the worst part of the day, did not look forward to that at all. I was management and was falsly accused of stealing money, they found out later it was my assistant manager stealing the money and pinned it on me."
good,This job requires a lot of hard work. If you do not have a well rounded team it will be a lot work for just one person to handle by themselves. Overall the job is ok.
good,Good job great deal for employees you can be sure you will get your full time hours and a little more overtime you have sundays off all the time and holidays they are closed
good,constantly moving.. non stop. some locations are better than others. it also depends on the area you work in . if you work in a nice neighborhood your customers are way nicer than the bad areas. if you have to collect be careful in the rough neighbor hoods... i had a knife and a gun pulled out on me. other than that it was fine.
good,"It is a fun place to work if you like working with the general public. It involves lifting and moving large furniture, delivering and retrieving from customers homes."
good,"I liked working there but the store manager was on drugs and so were some of the other ones in the area and even when it was reported it wasn't addressed. I was offered a promotion and raise to stay there but I stayed and took the responsibilities and never got the raise. Also when I was leaving I tried to get a transfer but the regional manager who had lied to me about the promotion blocked me from getting a transfer,."
good,"a day at rent a center was great when everybody did they job. ive learned how to sale,manage accounts,and work. well with. others. the fun parts was putting a smile. on my customers faces"
good,great place to work with many growth opportunities  just did not have enough tine for my personal life I went from and entry level with no experience to an Assistant Manager  within a year. I have never been promoted so quickly in a company in my life. Anyone wanting to get into the retail field this is a great place to start.
good,"Can get very busy, and standards are a requirement. everyone has not only credit goals but also sales goals. Customers are either very nice and understandable but you also have the very rude and mean customers that you need to balance."
good,"-Collections on a daily basis."
good,"Rent a center is a good place to work, hour lunches, and good hours. Good pay, and some room for advancement. Overall a great place with good management."
good,"Worked with a group of five to six people on selling, delivering, refurbishing merchandise, and collecting on accounts. I learned how to elevate my customer service skills and really build a rapport with customers. There were management changes with every manager having a different management styles that were introduced and it kept me on my toes learning how to mesh our styles. The hardest part of the job was working 10 hours a day. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know the customers and them being satisfied with learning and fulfilling their needs."
good,"Company in process of restructuring."
good,"Typical day of work consisted of making a round of calls to customers who are past due and trying to establish communication with them. After that, we coordinated with the Product Delivery specialists to get their deliveries and pick ups started for the day at around the afternoon after lunch. Then make another round of calls and start research for the high day past due accounts. Learned how to manager a small team of part timers, time management, and customer service. Hardest part was discussing unruly customers that didn't want to pay within the companies policies. Most enjoyable part was the freedom."
good,"the most enjoyable part of my job at TWC was doing research and interacting and helping out my co workers by issuing  bus, gas and Walmart cards."
good,"Fun job. Crazy hours. Good job if you dont have a life. Different everyday, management was sometimes hard to get along. Pay was not bad cause you work tons of overtime"
good,we do call through all day i learn how to deal with certain customers our manager has us do inventory my coworkers make it easier to get through the day dealing with angry past due customers helping a customer fix there account
good,Kept very busy selling and keeping track of accounts and delivery of merchandise and meeting and helping people. Maintaining showroom and Customer service.
good,"A typical day was completing daily P&L, bank deposit, and delivery schedule while supervising associates making collection calls and preparing for store opening. Throughout the day, taking payments, promoting sales and supervising staff for necessary daily tasks. Spoke to District Manager Hourly for updates. 50+ sales/telemarketing calls daily. I learned how the Rent to Own industry worked and how to correctly make collections on past due accounts. The management was good to work for. Most of the time helping with anything necessary to reach sales and collection standards. The hardest part of the job was telemarketing the same people repeatedly. The most enjoyable part of the job was the atmosphere. Even though fast paced, working with the customers and other coworkers made it enjoyable."
good,"I enjoy helping people get what they want or need and I have learned a lot about myself during my time with Rent-A-Center, but I really need to improve my quality of life and the demands are getting to be too much."
good,Good company to work for with a wide variety of customer base with room for growth to management.  Must be very competitive to deal with company goals and achievements.
good,"A typical day at the workplace, was ensuring the safety and security of inmates and the general public. If I had to chose a difficulty about the job, it would be trying to instill positive energy in a not so positive enviroment, but that was the most enjoyable part of my job, because letting inmates know, that just because they made a mistake doesn't give the right to give up on life, make the best out of a bad situation, change your way of thiinking and keep pushing foward."
good,"requires a lot of physical lifting and high sale demand, management wasnt much of a issues just the physical demand."
good,"they do a good job from promoting within , the hours are long and the days off are sparse."
good,"typical day was analyzing the productivity of my employees"
good,.A typical day at work starts between 8:30 and 9am and ends around 7:30 pm. The work environment is great but the constant long work weeks are hard sometimes.
good,"As an account manager /repossesion person i enjoyed this very much "
good,"A typical day at work would start out with making credit calls in the morning to collect debts and/or current due payments and reminder calls. We would make sure that the floor was always fully stocked for proper presentation. We would hold Monday morning meetings for the store and then as manager and assistant manager you would attend daily phone conference with other stores and managers to discuss sales and other upcoming events. The store should have at least a minimum of five people. A manager, assistant lead manager and the sales assistant manager, then there should always be 2 delivery persons. The hardest part of a day would be deliveries that are not only heavy pieces of furniture but it would be hard to deliver depending on size and space of entrance ways of a home and in a home. The most enjoyable part of it would be meeting all of the new faces and getting to know different people on a personal level."
good,"Tengo dos Años y he aprendido lo Suficiente que ya no tengo mas que Aprender, y esto No es Buen Sintoma"
good,"I learned how to manage a multi-duty fast paced work environment. An environment where detailed interaction with the client/customer base took place on a daily basis. Where maximum productivity and results are required within stringent scheduling time frames. This position allows you to build great relationships with customers and employees alike, while placing you in a situation where you can maximize potential and knowledge base."
good,"Pro : Rent A Center is a unique expiereance, People are great the job is not to hard to handle. The managers are fairly easy to get along with and the money is not to bad at all."
good, Successfully managed a staff of approximately 4 – 6 employees.
good,"I like working for Rent a Center, a typical day at work, clean and prepare the store for the day, check and prepare the bank deposit, check and rearrange if needed the deliveries, prepare my mailings and the daily paperwork,assign the goals for sales for the day to each employee, as we are ready to open the store for the public. During open hours greet customers, take calls, telemarketing,friday and saturdays assist employees with collections calls, address concerns, do transfers, receive merchandise, twice a week do inventories, once a week sent merchandise to service if needed, at the end of the day of everyday do the closing."
good,"I would Manage a staff of five,greet customers,Deliver merchandise to customers,interact with vendors and senior Management"
good,"Spend 55 hrs a week, starting at 8:30 am not getting off till 8-9pm. Would not recommend if you have a family. They pay well, but no work and life balance. 5 people to run a staff that needs 7-10 people, and requires you to do more then 1 job description. They teach you different Jobs, so that you are able to get several different job. Collections, Sales, Delivery and set up specialist, office manager etc."
good,Great company to work for never had an issue while working for them. Good benefits and work environment little to none promotions due to other employees with greater tenure
good,"CAR is an entry level position. The pay is what you would expect it to be, but here's the thing. In the year I worked here, I learned invaluable skills like phone call confidence, customer retention, and time management, especially with minimal supervision. My time at RAC landed me my next collections/retention job, straight commission, where I hit management my second month there, and went on to clear 55k my first two years (currently on year 3) working 30 hours a week. No way would I be successful where I am without my time spent at RAC. So in closing, I would 100% recommend this job to anyone, keeping this one thing in mind; for me, this job was a stepping stone, so once I mastered the skills this job offers, I bounced."
good,This was a different type of experience for me. Some of the customers were pleasant to work with. Some always had an attitude and nothing you did the help them was good enough. My coworkers are great but the hours are difficult to work around.
good,Bastante buena solo que cuando se queda sin jefe o gerente se dejan de hacer funciones que incomodan a los empleados generales. Mi empleo era solo ciertas funciones y muchos de ellos no realizaban sus pasos. Y hacen mal manejo de efectivo.
good,Rent a cemter is a challenging job mentally and physically but fun. It is a good place to go if your in need of a high cost item but can not afford to buy right out.
good,Rent A center truly gives opportunities to the community to obtain brand names at affordable rentals giving everyone the best of what they can afford.
good,"Good work environment. Great co workers and great pay. Tough to balance work and life, long days. Hard intensity work when delivering and slow tedious work when managing accounts and doing paperwork."
good,"Rent A Center is a job that takes a lot from you and of you to be successful.  Getting alont with customers is key to getting them to help you be successful.  You also must have tough skin due to the acts of aggressive, mean and irresponsible paying customers."
good,"Will age you if you start at a younger age.  Dealing with customers day in and out will not only make you appreciate your own life, it lets you see into the lives of others.  Rent A Center not only allowed me to better myself and better my understanding of life, it showed me that there are a lot of good people out in this word.  These people may not pay their bills on time and may smell a little funny, but most of these people(customers) will give you the shirt off their backs.  I've met and dealt with customers who were more like family than my own.  "
good,Rent a Center offers a lot of opportunities to grow within the company and work your way up. Working at a franchise i learned a lot about business management and how to grow the company.
good,Working in sales was not a plus but when I work I try and give it all that I have to offer. I preferred the credit side of the business because helping the customer resolve the issues with the product they desired to keep but financially had some issues.
good,I really enjoyed my job when in rent a center even though it was at times stessful. I was able to learn a lot regarding sales and inventory control and also being able to help our regular clients.
good,Each day was a challenge of organization of deliveries and collections. Learned how to sell electronics and white goods. Had experience with setting up for deliveries
good,"Not a bad company to work for, greta benefits and nice employees.  The pressure to get sales was not too bad but the hours were horrible.  Every weekend, 45+ hours a week, long days from 10am to 9pm."
good,Good work environment.   People I worked with were very knowledgeable and very helpful.  Company has great training to those with no experience.  Had realistic goals for employees.
good,"The job itself was ok, but the pay wasn't enough. Being required to work 10+ hours a day and only make 11 or $12/hr didn't make the job seem worth it."
good,Many times would have to work late to complete sales goals for the day and week and month.  What 7 days a week holidays and weekends and overtime when necessary.
good,RAC is at this time unstable and there are no guarantees that employment will exist after six months. Pay is decent for SM but overtime was taken from good hourly coworkers and the good ones left the company. The expectations are realistic and tough to meet since RTO is such a risky business. And it is always “What have you done for me today?” Not thanks for the accomplishments. Then they sold the company and now everyone is worried about their job.
good,"Days were busy and the time flew by. Learned lots of new skills, and the job itself was always interesting. Management was good and really strove to coach employees on proper procedure."
good,"As a manager required to work 55 hours a week, which is fine as it was not salary. Hard to get off on Friday or Saturday but always closed on Sundays. Not great if you want to have a life during the day as you spend all day at work."
good,Count cash drawer to balance till. Outline the day sing the daily activity log. Call past due accounts via phone email or text. Run audit inventory and necessary  merchandise hat ma need to be ordered.
good,The work is rewarding a lot of opportunities to advance and show teamwork. Great coworkers and managment very fun overall would recommend to a peer or stranger.
good,If you like the doing the same thing everyday then this is the job for you. Not much to it and little to no gratification. Great way to meet new people
good,Was fun at first but had a hard time with the manager doing what ever she wanted other than that if we had a new manager I’m sure I would of stayed longer.
good,Rent a center has the potential to be a very good job for people who are looking for a entry level position that will help them learn all aspects of true customer service
good,"Very competitive place to work, but very long hours. Not a place to work if you want to spend anytime really with family. Basically manage customers accounts all day."
good,"Typical workday for me was creating sales orders, both cash and weekly payment sales, customer service, billing, data entry and filing. I also trained other co-workers where applicable."
good,it was a decent job to work for had a lot of lifting to do but tips where good. I would recommend the job to anyone that likes hands on things and loves to drive trucks
good,"job is fast paced and requires full concentration."
good,My focus was on deliveries only. Would help in the store when the day was slow and there weren't that many deliveries. Hardest part was carrying things to a third floor apartment.
good,"The company's mission statement of ""Replacing Credit with TRUST"" is very true. My role was to be the liaison between the Retail Partner and the Corporate Office... ensuring that both parties were working collaboratively to best service the Customer. The programs are superior in many areas compared to competitors. Most of the co-workers at the Home Office are great people with strong work ethics and have a spirit of teamwork."
good,"Overall a great place to work with some room for advancement.  Leadership, management and trust need development.  great facility and great benefits and great location"
good,best part of the job is communicating with the customers and helping them and developing friendships.  hardest part of the job is getting people to pay the bill
good,"It was a fun place to work, Long hours but we kept busy at all times. Great sale experience. It was overall a great team and store. Alot of potential for growth. The weekly pay was great, probably my favorite part of the job."
good,The environment can be stressful and competitive but i enjoyed it. You work with the public and build a good customer base. Cold sales calling was the only part I didnt like.
good,"I had a good experience in RAC . The managers and directors were helpful and supportive. "
good,At RAC you must be a go getter. If you have a sales culture and a collection culture you'll go as far as you want with the company. Your the only one going to stop yourself from advancement. They could have a better work life balance.
good,Came across some very interesting people with this job. The fact of the matter is you are selling over priced products to people who couldn't afford them in the first place. Turn over is absouluty insane due to long hours and customers you have to deal with let alone Management always pushing for more sale sale sale no mater what it takes.
good,"a typical day at rent a center , come in clock in  log in to do early morning call outs for payments once done with that check the log sheet to see if any deliveries are  up for the day , check the times call each customer to confirm delivery..Once the delivery is confirmed we begin to prep what ever it is being delivered (living room set, bedroom set, tv, computer etc.. Once prepped pack the truck with the merchandise , deliver to customer and also set the merchandise up for the customer.."
good,during my first months I had the best manager ever after I was moved to another store with new co workers and a new manager everything fell apart. the manager was not helpful but would rather throw her workers under the bus to save herself. very different experiences between the two stores and positions I worked at.
good,Very physical job. It is a demanding job that requires you to be on your toes at all times. You have to be aware of your surroundings and be on time for deliveries
good,"RAC was a good place to work, I learned a great deal there about management and parts of customer service I hadn't experienced before. I loved being a manager, but becoming salaried definitely had it's disadvantages. The district manager insisted on managers working overtime often when they didn't meet sales goals."
good,This is a job and not a career in my eyes. The management doesn't always have their priorities in line. You always have Sundays off and either a Wednesday or a Thursday. They do work with your schedule outside of work if they find it important. One of the managers that I know personally is on coke and pills.
good,"I loved working for RAC, but I left for more money.  The best part about working there was the relationships I built with my co-workers.   We're all still good friends 7 years later."
good,My overall experience wasn't to bad just doing the job up north in the snow and ice wasn't fun at all. I would go back if they up the pay to $11 an hr. Not only are you doing delivery you are selling and collecting and telemarketing and cleaning other peoples filth when they are returned.Then turn around  and re sell. I am sorry $9 an hr was not enough for the amount of duties they want you to perform.
good,It is a good paying job if you stick around and make sure to learn from the right people. The job itself can get a little tiring with the long hours and sometimes stress depending on your numbers compared to company standard. If your store is doing good and making profit there is nothing to worry about.
good,Customers were hard to work with because they did not understand programs of company.  Coworkers great. Best part of job was problem solving to assist cust
good,This job was a ton of hard work and the company itself is an alright company but they are run very poorly depending on what district you work in.  Some districts are great but others are rundown and has bad management.  We had one manager that sexually harassed all the girls and it ended up going to court
good,Simplistic job with no nonsense but had pretty awful hours and the compensation wasn't worth the type of work you had to put in.  You often found yourself in less than hygienic circumstances when delivering products.
good,"Very exciting Job to work at, A lot of heavy lifting evolved if you enjoy that type of stuff, Then you will surely enjoy Rent-A-Center"
good,"Ok place to work, there is more to have to do than meets the actual job description. long hours and hard days for the money that is paid for the job that you have to do."
good,"Long hours, great pay. Basically call and try to collect everyday or get deals to collect on. Hardly room for advancement though. Hardest part of the job was selling the program."
good,RAC is a company that pays well unfortunately it also requires a lot of your time even at an entry position.  it may be a problem to work for them if you have a family because there is not much time left during your work week to be involved with personal matters
good,I enjoyed my time at Rent a center. The people are cool and I would have to say this is one of the better places I have worked. Management is really cool.
good,everyday is a sales and collections day. it is a very demanding job. it is fun to work with others we treat each other like family. guaranteed 40 hours weekly and weekly pay checks is a plus
good,I loved this job and learned a lot from it but the schedule was horrible.  I worked 10 hours a day.  On weekends you do not know what time you are getting goff.
good,rewarding and fun work environment- strong learning environment- fast paced- new experiences every day- overtime available- freedom to perform job tasks
good,"pues era de llegar a limpiar el piso de ventas checar precios hacer cmbios de precio hacer los contratos de la venta del articulo "
good,Fun and engaging job but lots of pressure. Must deal with time constraints. Fun dealing with customers. Customer complaint resolution can be challenging. Lots of sales pressure.
good,"Great customer service, customer is always the top priority. Great learning opportunity. The opportunity to grow with a company."
good,"hard work, long hours, get to meet people, learn how to deal with others, learn how to talk customers and coworker. learn how to set up showroom floor."
good,The co workers and management was a good part of the job. They were fair. I drove the delivery truck. The job was not really that hard. I really enjoyed the customers they were a big part of my day
good,"A typical day at this job may include loading and unloading merchandise such as furniture or appliances to or from the box truck to take to or from customer homes, as well as working around the store refurbishing returned items or setting up new items on the showroom floor. I learned a lot about teamwork and effective communication between team members to get the job done as professionally and efficiently as possible. The hardest part of the job, aside from the heavier lifting, was taking merchandise from customers' homes to return to the store if they could no longer make their payments. The most enjoyable part of the job was providing service to customers in need and establishing good working relationships with my coworkers."
good,Overall it was a great experience.  I've learned a lot with the company just ready to take a better step in life. Need a pay increase not making enough hours
good,I actually really enjoyed my time with Rent A Center it was always an adventure. you never knew what your day was going to be like. I met a lot of interesting people and even made some great friends
good,nice place to work if your goal driven and like to work long hours.  job is very demanding and requires alot of work.  must be able to work with people
good,for the pay i wouldnt do it again it was an alright work place when things were organized other than that it was very fun alot of heavy lifting for low pay
good,not a bad spot to work. got used to lifting appliances and couches. local deliveries. wish the part time spots were full time
good,Great company to work for. Everyday is different with different obstacles. Love it here and would hate to leave my team. Made lots of friends I consider family.
good,Demanding job with many perks. As any other large company there is usually a strain on you with so much expected of you. It's understandable that there are expectations and goals on a daily basis.
good,Every day I make a new gold of sales. Make diferents offersts by phone to with the index telefhone book and look for good sales. Managment responsabilities. I learn not to give up. I inspire my co-workers to be very responsable with they golds. Exesive ours of work. be satisfy wthit the sales maked at the end of the day.
good,Very busy rent to own store.  That's where I learned to do customer service and verifying income and personal references.  Management very understanding and flexible.  There was only 5 of use in the store we were all very close like brothers and sisters.  Hardest part was having to do a pick on a account that was past due because everybody falls on hard times.  The best part was when we were all able to get together after the store was closed.
good,You meet many types of people and get to learn about many peoples stories. Helping meet the needs of the people who come into the store.
good,"late hours don't work with me anymore. Need a new job."
good,"Not a bad company to work for. Would not recomend to anybody though. Never home, and the pay does not compensate for the work that you do on a daily basis."
good,"Too much work, not enough time at home.  Provides adequate training, but sometimes the demands are too much.  The hours are long, sometimes too long.  There needs to be more balance of life."
good,"you will learn a lot about yourself, management at my store was very involved with the workers to try and teach them everything they knew."
good,"a typical day at work was daily morning paper work, a weekly conference call with DM, 2 times collections calls, 2 or 3 times daily marketing calls, constant and consistent sales activities, daily deliveries and pick ups of merchandise, and constantly answering emails from superiors and constantly justifying your productivity."
good,"Customers were nice. I didn't receive a lot of training on the job, may be the only downside. And we were way understaffed at the time. But it was great because I like being close to the community."
good,A typical day at rent a center involved me doing credit runs on customers whether it was over the phone or making drive to their house. Making deliveries to customers homes. At times you never knew what management was looking for. one week they'd expect something out of you and the next week it'd be the opposite
good,Been there almost 8 years and it's been a nice reliable job.  Great benefits.  They give you your 40 hours and more if wanted weekly.
good,"The job is great, and the money is good. The hours are very long."
good,"management at this company is very good, but the hours are long and the job is stressful. Not a ideal job for a student or very family oriented person. although pay and benefits aren't bad."
good,I thoroughly enjoyed my time working as a team member for RAC.
good,"No two days at RAC were the same. Everyday presented a new challenge whether it was meeting new people and trying to sell them a new product; assembling furniture or an appliance for a delivery, getting a customer's credit who may have been overdue for payment back on track, dealing with an unsatisfied customer, Promoting sales for the company through consistent phone calls and sales pitch, learning more about my co-workers and how to work more cohesively with them etc. The challenges never stopped and I enjoyed every bit of it"
good,"It was a good job, good ppl. Always had something to do. But not worth the pay"
good,Rent A Center has a a great work environment. The people that I worked with were very friendly. I really enjoyed working there.
good,"Rent-A-Center is a fun place to work if you don't mind drastically overcharging people for furniture, appliances and electronics they probably want but don't necessarily need.  And let's face it, if you walk into a Rent-A-Center, you probably already know what you're in for as far as paying too much for something to have the option of buying it over time with poor credit.  If you want a decent workout mixed with some good office and phone experience, this is a fun job but I wouldn't make it a career."
good,I would recommend working at MetroCast if you're currently a student looking for a stable paycheck. This is not the place to work if you'd like an actual career.
good,This job was very challenging yet very rewarding. The tasks and duties were difficult and long hours but I enjoyed every minute of it
good,"I worked for a few Rent A Centers in the time I was there. One in particular ruined it for me. The store manager was very rude. He sat in the office all day, literally doing nothing. If a customer wanted to speak with him about something, he would automatically jump on them like they were bad people. He treated his associates like garbage. If not for him, I would have enjoyed working there."
good,When I went to my manager after having issues for several months with the lead supervisor I was told that I needed to learn to deal with things and nothing was taken care of.
good,"Maintained & Exceeded  Account Management Percentages, (weekly, monthly, yearly) according to company numbers. Delivered and helped construct customer merchandise in a timely and professional manner."
good,employees were fun to work with. Hardest part of my job was delivering furniture and tracking down customers for payment.
good,"Collection Specialiest-  work in the Financial Service Department.   This department over see the accounting activity of 3200 Rent A Center store located throught the US."
good,"Working here, you must have the priority of help people, specially when they try buy furniture with weekly payments, feels good, when you see customers leaving happy because your friendly aproach"
good,Work/ life ratio is not very manageable. They require a minimum of 50 hours a week. You start at 9:30 in the morning until 8:00 or 8:30 in the evening. Some management/ Store Managers are totally unprofessional.
good,dealing with people who tell the biggest lies and have the worse behavior when trying to help them the co workers was okay but the work hours were too long on night I didn't get home till midnight
good,"Rent A Center is a fast paced comfortable work environment."
good,A new challenge is presented every day. The best part of the job is providing customer service.  I've learned a great deal about property management and real estate in the process.
good,"loved the Job, there was long hours and the pay could be decent, but my experience was the lack of training and management had issues but this was not at all stores. we had a lot of issues from when we bought out a competitor and used their manager in place of our own. i loved the company and the work i was doing."
good,"I enjoyed working for Rent A Center. They gave me the experience I need for working one on one with customers. I will always be grateful for what I learned working for them. The management was fair with each employee, My co-workers were very considerate of their surrounds. The enjoy part of the job was getting to talk with new people daily. The worst part was getting cussed out over the phone but I didn't let it get to me."
good,Nothing bad to say about this company. Love my supervisor. No complaints
good,"Its a job that uses a lot of communication skills and time."
good,Working for this company allowed me to realize that it is possible to love your job.
good,Alot of detail and selling and repoing. The worst part is all the long hours and never having a day off. And nowhere to advance.
good,"I had to sell merchandise within the store.. Go over rental agreenments, deliver and pick up if needed.. I had to maintain a route of 50+ people who I had to call and make more offers and deals.. I had to see to it that their payments were on time as well as me selling them nice merchandise.. Only 5 ppl worked in the store so it wasn't crowded. I got a long with them all.."
good,A  typical day at work is for you to get 5 deliveries a day. the management was great. we were all close as a work family. The hardest part of this job was picking up a customers furniture if they couldnt pay. It was just interacting with all the customers I would com in contact with the whole day
good,"A learning environment where you can grow.  From sales to deliveries, to account management, good learning professional experience."
good,"Heavy lifting."
good,"Always something new everyday. Collections was tough but fun sales goals are obtainable."
good,Demanding for being on the phone from the time you walk in the door till the time you leave. Either talking to customers about what the specials are or collecting payments. Not a hard job but the willingness to work with the public is a must. 
good,Managed 25-50 customer accounts. Made sales on the floor and then delivered merchandise to customers. I had received employee of the month several months in a row out of 50+ account managers in the region.
good,Worked in grocery stock for 3 years and the government raised the minimum wage rate. My pay did not raise with it. I was stuck making the same as a new hire after 3 years of service.
good,Rent a center is the type of job that is very demanding but also rewarding if you can meet your goals. With RAC you do need to be very goal orianted in a sense that no body can get in your way. With that said RAC will take up a lot of your time a minimum 48 hours a week. If you can keep up with the hours and the pace set by RAC corp then this can and will be one of the best positions you can be in.
good,Chasing customers down to pay.
good,"Rent a Center is a good place to work. A performance based company that gives you the opportunity to succeed around every corner. My coworkers always made my day enjoyable and we helped train some of the best people in the field. The job entails telemarketing, collections, point of sale, as well as troubleshooting, construction and in some cases..destruction."
good,"This job has long hours, 12-16 hour days, 5-6 days a week. Not the best job if you have a family. Management works right along side of you and sweat just like everyone else. The hardest part was the delivery and set up of goods. I always got 8 or more hours of overtime each week."
good,"Very fast paced and pretty fun to work with sales and collections,"
good,The co-workers were always fun to be around and team work was always in task.
good,"Not worst place to work, def not best.."
good,fast paced company that is good to work for but has its flaws with no family life. You go in early to work and get off late with only sunday and one more day off.
good,Very long hours but very stable. Advancement opportunities from within the company are really possible
good,I learned retail management at this company. I started as an Account Manager and worked my way as a top performer to the position of Market Manager in the Albany NY Market. I held numerous psoitions and relocated a number of times for this company. The Most enjoyable thing about this job was the people interactions and the satisfaction that you were actually changing peoples lives everyday.
good,My co-workers and workers around my office were very down top earth and learned a lot while there.
good,I thoroughly enjoyed working for this company. It was very structured at times however very challenging which I prefer.
good,Rent-A-Center is a very friendly enviornment with outstanding customer service and wounderful people to work with.
good,Good for advancement but fear of being let go. Need more stability for family and my three children.
good,"Has a high turnover rate with upper management, ie district, store, and regional managers, require 50+ hours per week. Split days off. Was an ok place to work. Would have been better if their upper management was properly trained to support store staff more consistently."
good,Great place to meet new people.
good,If you want to become a sales person this is the place to start. You are put in many situations that will help you in the future in what to say and what not to say in making sales.
good,It was a great experience to work for Rent-A-Center. I got to meet new and interesting people everyday. It was great being able to help people who were in need of the products that Rent-A-Center provides along with service.
good,"You work with people all the time. You must be okay with calling people to try and sell things. Good sells skills. Be on time. Able to move, and lift heavy items."
good,The work and life balance is not at all balance. They expect you to give them your whole time to them. They are always threatening to replace you. They only care about themselves.
good,Stressful because traffic and rush by the manager at time to get certain items set up. i worked in the dyckman area and i enjoyed it since there was a lot of things going on and beautiful women to look at. Hardest part was brings up a whole 12 piece bedroom set up the fifth floor with no elevator or bringing up a sofa-pullout mattress to the fifth floor with no elevator. i learned quite a bit on the job like patience is a virtue and that customers are just plain dumb.
good,"The employees you work with are usually friendly and generally get along with one-another. Not a good management strategy at all. Sales manager, credit manager, and store store manager in charge of 2-5 employees."
good,"Working as an sales manager here is really a chill job. Most of the day consists of collections and soliciting.  On fridays and Saturday’s you would do field visits if your numbers were high. If you don’t have two CARs, sometimes you had to get on the truck and do deliveries yourself. Hours are 10-7 Monday through Saturday, only off day is Tuesday.  Decent hours, but depending on your personal life it may not be the best as far as work life balance"
good,Hi paced enviroment. Teaches a lot of skills and developes well rounded  business acurement if you are not willing to work and stay on task notg the job for you. pay and bonus is very good
good,I’ve been with Rent-A-Center for over a year and it’s going well. The work life balance can be challenging working 9 or 10 hours a day 5 days a week closed sundays. Management can use some help at many of the locations. But overall a decent place to work.
good,Wonderful coworkers and training in the stores I worked in while in Florida.  Customers became more than just customers. We genuinely care for our customers and vise versa.
good,Awesome job eh on the pay I do enjoy the environment but management is a little rough around the edges other than that fantastic place to pursue a career
good,"Overall it was a good company to work for, except for the extra demand on late hours. Offer good benefits for employees, incentives to win sales contests,"
good,"Mostly enjoyed working here . I did compete a total of 14 years. I loved all the relationships that I built with  customers . That makes the business. Being able to set goals and allow myself to meet or exceed them. It’s realy a good company to work for if you do not have a big family . Sometimes on"
good,"Never a dual moment."
good,Good company and great coworkers. I loved working with my supervisor and having her as a mentor. My department was filled with people who understood teamwork!
good,Great Place to work but the turn around was insane. People were there one day gone the next. Constant management turn around and employees were often burn out filling more than one job at a time. Compensation is average for the area. Benefits are pretty good but the health insurance is around $700 for a family of 3 which takes a lot of your pay plus $40 a drs appt. Then you really can't get time off to go to the drs. Also be prepared to work till 9 each night. Some nights we get off at 730 but most it is 8 to 9. Be prepared to work on your day off. Sundays are always off. Pay is prompty every week which is nice. Working overtime does help a lot to add to the paycheck. Customers are often rude so you need to have great customer service and be prepared to be cursed out daily as well as threatened.
good,every morning i would come in get files of past due people start my calls then do deliveries if needed if not i would go to the customers doors who went past due to try to get them to pay or on a paying schedule that was more suitable for them. i worked with some good people there manager was the best i've ever worked for in any job.
good,a lot of heavy lifting. pay wasnt that bad. i would work with them again. They do have benefits not as great as they could. Nit a bad place to work at all
good,"Calling customers on your route, scheduling deliveries and pick ups of merchandise for customers. Workplace culture was fairly positive but the long hours did cause some tension among the team. Having to potentially work really long hours and knowing that you might have to do it all over again was the worst part about being employed with them."
good,"It was a pleasure working here and never really wanted to leave.  With the sale of my location to a competitor I was forced to move on."
good,"Over all my current experience working with Rent-A-Center is a decent one. This is mainly due to the staff that was chosen for my location. The workplace culture was great. I would say the hardest part of the job would be compensating for the company's cut backs. The most enjoyable part of the job was my staff , my team and our competitive environment when it came to store Sales and overall competition between or against the other locations in our region."
good,Very little home time. Great job to see happy customers. Very routine so you don’t have to relearn the job daily. The employee purchase discounts are great!!!
good,Overall good company.  Good company culture. Kind of an old school good old boy network but it's not something you can't overcome. Flexible hours are allowed.
good,"Working in this company I have learned a lot about business. I learned a lot about the company that I did not like, which includes how day to day things are ran, employees are not treated well and are not held accountable for many things."
good,"I enjoyed working at Rent A Center.  I grew beyond what I thought  I would accomplish there. This company adapted to the times and I adapted along with it.  I had plenty of growing pains with this company , but that only made me better. Unfortunately my department will be close down and I look forward to a new journey in life. Thank you Rent A Center for the opportunity and growth."
good,The projects were good and meaningful. Lots of management changes meant that there were numerous changes in direction on their most important projects.
good,Loved working with customers and being a part of our community. Upper management was very credit oriented. Sometimes more than anything else. They were to one tracked minded.
good,"I made calls to all late customers and refrences atleast 3 times a day.Delivered furniture to customers ,picked up furniture from customers. Management was on a good relationship with its co works to a certain extent .Hardest part of the job would be delivering furniture."
good,"Wonderful work environment,"
good,A typical day as an Assistant Manager was to ensure customer satisfaction through maintaining customer retention. Reporting accurate quarterly sales and budgets for store profit as well as losses. Trained customer account representatives to decrease delinquent customer accounts.
good,The job is very demanding physically and mentally the customers are so rude at times the management is so hard on you and also you're physically putting a lot of strain on your body with deliveries
good,I worked there almost 10 years ago so i''m not sure how much applies. Every employee was full time and was expected to work from open to close. The only variation among employees was which day of the week you got off. Every employee also had to learn every aspect of the job to be able to operate independently in any given situation.
good,"Learned a lot about people and life. Learned how to manage and perform great customer service, lots of opportunity for advancement if you apply yourself."
good,"I have been with company for 6+ years and have grown with the company and now the company pushes for more time away from family and more responsibility from a sister company without compensation or repaid for the profit lost from doing the responsibility’s of the secondary company."
good,"Nice company to work for. "
good,"As long as you are one of the top stores in the district you are good, if not be prepared to work all the time. Management is more of a do as I say not as I do, and they tell you to do specific tasks but don't help you along the way. As long as you are not in management it is a pretty good job but when you start running your own store they completely change."
good,"There are not a lot of jobs that will prepare you for Rent-a-Center but the knowledge and experience you gain through RAC is one of a kind and will help you in many areas of your life.  Good people with a good outlook in general, hours are the toughest part, especially if you have children at home.  A typical day runs from 9-9:30a until 7:30-8p.  You do not get two days off in a row, however, you are guaranteed Sundays off. 2 weeks paid vacation after first year and decent benefits, partially paid by company."
good,"Spending a lot of time reverse engineering practices put in to place years ago. Then try to convince the business there is a better way to do things. "
good,"Great Company to work for there are some long hours you have to work and the time from as far as open to close should be different , due to family time and life bout side of rent a center"
good,"After leaving a secure position to take the position at Rent-A-Center, my RAC position was eliminated after 8 weeks.  Overall the company seemed ok but not sure about its stability at this point."
good,"A typical day at work you might have to deescalate a customer from trying offensive behavior. Its fast paced trying to keep up with sales and customer accounts while trying to maintain a healthy and clean work environment. I learned that if you take a deep breath every hour and just take time to remember that customers are only human things can benefit us all.Working with management can have its pros n cons but all in all there are many benefits. The hardest part of a workday was making sure by end of day all your accounts were paid and ready for a new merchandise when sales came up. The most enjoyable part of the work day for myself was when I could ride and do pickups from customers or clients, I would get to see some customers who I hadn't seen in store in a while also work on new sales."
good,Come into work call past due customers in hopes of getting them to pay then call people for sales leads. Sale to in coming foot traffic and take payments of current customers then try to convert them into a new sale.
good,"Sets clear expectations. Challenging but fun.  All training and tools provided for you to succeed.  Your success truly depends on you!    Games are played among your peers in other locations to motivate you, with winner having ultimate bragging rights.  All while motivating yourself to achieve your own goals.  I truly enjoyed working for this company.  I was able to fast track my career from the entry level all the way DM position in only 4 years!"
good,it was great working with the staff at rent a center. I liked working with the customers and being able to help people out who may have needed are services.
good,"Needs more training in getting her employees to work together in a safe environment. I enjoyed working for the company and serving the customers. Most of the customers wanted only to talk to me when I was at work, because of my friendly and professional work experience that I show them."
good,Rent a Center is a great place to work.  Renting and Collecting are the main duties and you are expected to meet certain goals.  The most enjoyable part of the job were the employees.
good,Great company to work for but the current manager has no idea how to work as a team which is really hard for the ex military people that work there.Thank you.
good,I worked for them for almost 13 years i started at the bottom and worked all the way to being a store manager. The problem with the company is when we changed regional manager's the district went down hill from there with the district manager's.
good,"Working with RAC was fun and very easy to learn the ropes. Employees are fun but very efficient with tasks and the normal work days. The hours are sort of trying but if you dont mind working the hours given, give it a shot. The pay was worth the work."
good,"Very stressful job. Gotta have the right mind set to work here. If you're good with customer and have patience than its good for you , also if your interest in working OT this is a job for you."
good,"A physically demanding and stressful place to work but can advance with hard work and I Hate to say it but favoritism can come into play there. When I was there, sometimes people who gave less effort, were given more chances to move up than harder workers but those who put in the time and effort had more success overall."
good,"Fun place to work.  Great benefits, employees and management.    A wealth of information about the growth of the company shared at quarterly meetings."
good,"Pretty relaxed place when you hit your numbers! (Collections/Sales)"
good,typical day at work was to try and make more sales calls than our other stores.We also had to try and make more sales without losing any costumers.It was always competition with other stores.
good,"The job isnt bad persay but the long hours and constant struggle to meat everchaning demands makes it hard for anyone who has a family or anyone going to any kind of college, great benifits for the postion with paid time off after 1 year of employment."
good,This company is a great place for a recent college graduate looking to join a large company with room for advancment. The hours are long but a small sacrifice never hurts.
good,"Had a blast at the onset of my employment. Lately it seems as though everyone is out for themselves. No teamwork, just other people reaping the fruits of my labor."
good,this company has a wide range of perks for its employees such as employee purchase programs and bonuses. the downfall is that the upper management belittles its store managers and makes it hard to focus on meeting goals.
good,"If you are young and looking to make a good living, this is the place for you. It is not ideal for people with families as the hours are crazy but if you want to hustle, this is it"
good,I loved working for rrent a center. It's a tough business. But I loved it. I truly enjoyed helping the district and regional performance. I left due to personal situations that prevented me from giving 100% at the time. I just wish my District manager had been a bit more understanding because I would still be there.
good,"Rent a Center is by no means a bad place to work, Opportunity for advancement and plenty of mandatory overtime. Drawback being the amount of hours, long days and every Saturday mandatory. Very corporate environment."
good,"Providing customer service such as taking payments, deliveries and finding the right product for each customer. Also ensuring good work relations with employees."
good,Decent place to work. Family time is limited due to working all day pretty much. Good Benifits and health Care. The 401K program is pretty good. Not a good choice if your family oriented.
good,Definitely a busy environment. Sometimes work could become overwhelming but for the most part not a bad place to work. Great coworkers but lots of gossip
good,"Rent-A-Center is a job where advancement is very attainable, I moved up from a Customer Account Representative to an Assistant Manager within a span of six months time.  I do enjoy working here, it's a team effort to keep sales and and credit numbers low.  We work well together but the hours are long and it becomes difficult leveling out social and work life."
good,"Opening the store running reports. Lots of customer service."
good,Minimum 12 hr days and 70 hr weeks on average as store manager. Slim chance for weekends off. Thankfully every Sunday was a day off. Benefits were very generous.
good,"A wide variety of job tasks, meet many different people.  Must be comfortable with collections to succeed.  Good phone skills is also a must.  Everything can be learned as long as you have good attitude"
good,Rent a center is a great company and has opportunity to grow. You can begin as a driver and end up a manager. The pay is weekly and the benefits are really great
good,I was able to work hard and move up the rankings pretty fast . I actually wouldn't mind working for them again . Everyday was something new. It was very exciting but sometimes frustrating work.
good,Stores possess a team atmosphere. Store manager > Sales manager > credit manager > customer service reps > delivery. All work together to handle day to day which is nice. Guaranteed hours
good,During my employment I went from entry level poison to store manager in just a couple years. Fast paced number driven employer.  Keeping good numbers makes happy times
good,"The most enjoyable part of this job was being to able to see my customers face to face and really be able to get to know them as people rather then just a customer, Being able to build a relationship with our customers is what made us successful, and kept me wanting to come back to work for eight years."
good,"there was never a boring day at Rent-A-Center. I learned a lot from this company in the short time i was there. People skills is a must, Along with communication skills. You must be energetic ready to sell. Heavy lifting is required along with trust for your co workers."
good,First thing I will say is that if you are not ready to do some physical work I wouldn't apply. But overall good place and good pay
good,what i learned. was about being good with custormers and make sure they got the right stuff. handleing the itimes the best way.
good,Your were constantly on the move and this job. It was an exciting place to work because you got to travel and me new people/customers.
good,"An a excited job were you can learn new skills everyday,very pleasant co-workers, the ability to preform job duties.the availability to work with a great team of co-workers and get the help you need."
good,"I was able to learn Marketing, put knowledge to collections be creative to promotions as a store Manager I was able to grow in the company as an Employee and as a Person"
good,"Exceptional work environment, A plus on learning and implementing marketing strategies. Could have seen myself working there for the next thirty years had they not been bought out and relocated to Houston."
good,"Loved the company and my job description, no communication between Management and employees. I am very confident that i succeed in my position at Rent A Center, above expectations, customers loved me."
good,"Paid time off, paid holidays. Always had sundays off. Good benefits, good insurance. Always got paid weekly which is a plus  Guaranteed 48 hours every week so no worries about having a short check."
good,"As an activity assistant everyday is something new. Finding out ways to keep the patients entertained, and dealing with the elderly can go either good or bad. But my job was to keep them happy and i liked it because not everyone in a (nursing) home gets visits from family."
good,Lots of heavy lifting and at times several deliveries are done at buildings with no elevators which would then require more heavy lifting. Not enough benefits or barely any for part time workers and the advancement from pt to ft is close to impossible.
good,"I enjoyed my employment, very employee oriented company.  I learned a lot in the Accounts Payable department . My coworkers were very helpful and friendly."
good,"Come to work with a will to work attitude everyday"
good,Great company excellent compensation.  Not very good for family life hours and not family-friendly at all. Hard work and high expectations each person which is not always a bad thing just when they are meant its not a good situation.
good,"Performance based environment. "
good,"Days started off by calling customers making sure they were making their payments on time and keeping up with their bills. Once phone calls where finished we would then begun making runs to pick up payments from the customers homes or attempt to pick a payment if no payment was mad we would usually begun to repo the merchandise. Runs all finished up we would then bring the payments or merchandise into the store and log what we had brought back, the next step then would be to then refurbish the merchandise for resale or set it aside till the customer was once again ready for their merchandise. Through out the day we would make sales as often as we could greeting and helping customers into their specific needs. The co-workers were usually fun and easy to get along with on a daily basis. The company was very organized and had lots of room for growth."
good,"This is a fun place to work, not really hard can be stressful but good people to work with.  In this job we help many people whom do not have good credit get nice things for their homes.  The main demographic for this company is single mothers."
good,"its a very physical job and very, very long hours you work at a min of 50 hours a week the pay is good but super long hours. it is hard to progress in the company you have to wait till someone gets fired or moves up and that's not very often!"
good,"Luckily I worked w/ a great group of guys, so work every day was almost like hanging out w/ friends. Obviously conflicts and disputes will arise as w/ any job, but all in all I look back on my time as a positive learning experience. I was the sales manager/ asst store manager, so I was responsible for the bulk of the sales/ customer interaction."
good,I came in and put everything on floor or outside to advertise our products that way they can sell. I have learned to sell products and how to put the products together and how to take them down. I also learned how to manage my time to where I got all my deliveries done  before my shift ended. My co-workers were nice and great to work with. There was nothing hard about this job to me. Everything I did at this job was enjoyable.
good,"pleasant experience, love working with the public."
good,"opening store and contacting accounts past due then deliveries or returns that are scheduled for the day makes the day go by fast. How to manage customers accounts . Making sure inventory is correct. Great place to work if you like variety on a daily basis."
good,"answer phone s"
good,Good company to work for. Fun to work with the customers. Excellent benifits
good,not family oriented and not worth the pay. they dont care about personal family issues.
good,Buen trabajo y muy buen ambiente para alguien que solo quere ppasar el rato sin responsabilidades
good,"My typical day was making phone calls in the mornings and delivering in the afternoon."
good,"Overall, good company with good benefits. Learned many elements of business with no focus on just one. Very long days and don't get much time with family unless you are higher management. Down side is that it is a company that can talk out both sides of mouth and want one thing and say another. Individuals would take advantage of customer base and a good old boy system. But because of pay and benefits along with one didn't need a high education to move up, it was a good place."
good,"Help with duties such as advertising, sales, and store policies"
good,"good people"
good,"A typical day was very fast paced and you are always trying to grow the business. The first part of the day is spent trying to get in touch and collect on deliquent accounts by calling all past due customers. Also, during this time I would do the deposit and paperwork from the previous day. Then, I would get the showroom in rent ready condition.After lunch I would go over the Dailya activity planner with the customer account reps and plan out all deliveries and returns for the day. i would also meet and greet customers as they come and setup their accounts. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people everyday."
good,"I was working on a project which had a very tough release schedule. I had to work overtime quite often.  I did learn alot of thins there, like new technology and how balance my person life and work"
good,RAC is good to work at but you have really long days and its a fast pace some days you have no time to sit down the co workers are all great if you have a great team to work with no one lets another struggle with something heavy we always help each other....
good,We always have something to do and at the same time we build great customer relationships to make them feel comfortable coming in to the store. We also provide great customer service to make customers want to keep coming back.
good,Meeting new people daily was the best part about working at R-A-C
good,"First thing I would do would be clock in, log in to my computer, pull up my call list; first I would call anyone who was past due, than give a courtesy call to everyone who was due that day, once doors open start taking care of customers, and answering the phone, if you were asked you had to take the bank deposit, check the daily planner and start loading the truck according to delivery time. You would go on the road and delivery, or pick up furniture. Make sure that delivery confirmation paper work were signed. Come back to the store unload the truck if needed to be. Make more phone calls, finish any paper work. Due your cleaning duties before closing the store. Clock out and go home."
good,A typical day starts at 9:00am and ends around 7:30pm. Rent-A-Center puts a great deal of focus on training and promoting from within. They preach a balance approach to rent to own. 
good,Calling the delinquent account customers also responsible for delivery and set up of merchandise and appliances in the store and customers homes.
good,"A typical day at work would be trying to get people to do a rent to own contract with Rent-A-Center instead of them going out to buy it in the stores."
good,"While is was a very good paying job, when a store runs shorthanded you do not get days off. Working 65+ hours a week for over 3 months while your store manager decides whether or not to give up good profit numbers while you only have Sundays off is very trying."
good,I would always make sure that I was in my office before the staff arrived to give me time to review the numbers and goals for the day.
good,Work 50hrs/week. Greet and assist customers as they enter the store. Inform them about store specials and products/retail that's new. Promote worry free guarantee. All items are serviced free of charge as long as agreement is current. Stock and order merchandise for store. Handle accounts and set up deliveries
good,"I loved my job and how fast I advanced, the pay is great but you are there from sun up to sun down and that's not a good thing when you have a family and small children"
good,Hard work but fun can be very stressful and long hours with the right people it can be an amazing and fun place to work. It can get very monotonous but overall it is a really good job.
good,I enjoyed my time a Rent A Center. My boss was great. We are both ex-military so we had that in common. The hours were long but we were compensated well.
good,"The job was not very hard at all, the hours of operation and time in/out of the store grately needing fixed. Hours of which the company choose to operate in and follow was a great misinformed detail upfront, which in turn is greatly difficult due to the HOME/WORK relationship. Which in turn made it hard to have a life outside the company and time for family, expecially with the mandatory days which come across illegitimate and unfair when not applied to all positions."
good,Gave me a job. Other than that......no chance for advancement; at least not for me
good,"Hard work at times, but fun an different every day. Different facets to the job that makes the day go by."
good,"typical day was calling collections/running collections routes"
good,When there is organization it’s a great place to work. They’re starting to take training the employee 100% serious and are always looking for new talent.
good,The Corp office is out of touch with its core customers and their market. They have scaled back their product offerings and do nothing to compete in today's market and expect the stores to generate all sales leads
good,"Everyone is great to get along with, deliver lots of furniture, TV's, beds, computers, phones, speakers, washers & dryers, lots of driving, lots of rins and phone calls to customers."
good,If you don't mind working long hours and angry customers and sad sad stories from customers that cant pay their bill then this is the place for you 10- 12 hr days
good,"Great Employer to work for , flexible hours! Offered Gym reimbursement , Service to community is applaudable , Decent Hours and Salary, Great Staffing"
good,"Rent a center is a great place to grow "
good,"I will work here again , I loved it , fast paced , friendly competitive. If you know how to talk to people Bi-lingual big plus. Your only as successful as the product you distribute and to the honest people you distribute to."
good,Unit read a common people tell him kneel your money for into their houses to pick up the furniture knocking on the doors and having your management tell you are not being aggressive enough
good,Great employees. Good working atmosphere.  Does not pay well according to stress involved especially when you can go flip a hamburger for the same pay.
good,Not really mich to say. It was fun while there. You meet people who would like to buy product and you deliver ot to there place. Once thats dine you help them manage their account.
good,Started as full-time account representative and achieved promotion to assistant manager within six months. Moved up to store manager in as little as five years with the company.
good,"I was able to work 4 days a week at 10 hour days. I would do my work and management would not bother me too much.  Many days were easy, and I sat there and completed my work every day.  Management was very kind to me and we worked well together."
good,"It’s a good company to work for, it’s a fast pace job always trying to catch up with the thing that need it to get done on the daily basis. You do it all at rac; we clean, vacuum, sales, collections, telemarketing, deliveries, installations, verifications, etc"
good,it wasnt a bad place to work i went looking for another part time job and it was there for me fairly easy if you can drive a truck and haul furniture around
good,Great job for advancement. Company is having a layoff every year. Spent 15 years there and there is always room for growth.Company needs to remember the field is your customer too.
good,I enjoyed working at Rent-A-Center because I met different people every day and some customers grow on you and you develop kind of a client relationship with them.
good,"Start of day consisted of prepping daily deposit, calling collections for payment or schedule returns. Sales per day as well as number of sales calls per day. Deliveries and returns scheduled on a daily basis. Worked on a 4 person staff so challenging at times to get things done in a timely fashion."
good,"It was a straight forward job, clock in, do your job, clock out. it was a little physical but it made time fly. I liked it, your not stuck in the office a majority of time which was nice, the team work was great, the pay was nice,"
good,Very intense days but also can be a lot of fun.  On the road a lot making deliveries and trying to get customers to pay on time.  Hardest part of the job is getting customers to consistently pay on time.  The most enjoyable part is being on the road a lot.
good,i was an account manager and had to deal with alot of customers. handle more than 200 accounts. also i helped with the moving crew. we promoted sales.
good,Aprendi la organizacion de una tienda y liderar el grupo de ventas.
good,"i loved my job with this company , unfairly because of lack of management and a very stressful place i had to remove my self, great co workers , good opportunity's the hardest part was holidays coming in so early and leaving late , as a manager was required high numbers   .. lack of proper training"
good,Prove Customer Service to the community with Furniture Sales and Good Management Team the most Enjoyable part of the job was have a good Team to work with tho make the Store Sucess
good,"Extremely competitive job. Always looking for sales and what you can do better to bring in the foot traffic or get the phone to ring. Always trying to help out customers in how they can obtain ownership and also make on time payments. Not your average day even though you do the same thing every day, but it's never with the same customer. Learned a lot from Rent A Center including how to plan a P&L properly, team work on a more delegating role, working with upper management on making sure the store is profitable. The only compliant would be with upper management. Even though they say they're there to help with making sure the store is successful. They can also drive you crazy and make you feel like your not good enough. Not the right way to motivate your team!! Hardest part of the job is finding sales and the most enjoyable is the different customer that you do get to meet on a daily basis. Getting the customers to open up to you and tell you about their everyday lives is phenomenal and rewarding all in it's own."
good,Through out my time with RAC I have had many opportunities to advance.  You get to meet great people and learn a great deal about business.  Your day to day is what you make of it.  My advice is to always have a positive attitude.
good,RAC is a strong company that is at a critical point in its life cycle. Changing consumer habits has affected the companies place in the market place. Overall the company does a great job training coworkers and promoting from within.
good,Rac has long hours but good compensation and benefits. The credit side of the business sometimes get left in the dust. Sales are not tough and the overall office atmosphere was good.
good,"Love working here, I don't really have anything negative to say. Provided me advancement opportunities, good pay, vacation time. Great place to work. Pretty relaxed staff. Only work with a few people, store runs on 3 managers, 2 other full time employees and 1 or 2 part time. Work days usually go from about 8-7 give or take. One day off during the week and closed on sundays."
good,a typical day for me at rac was to first clock in and do the daily deposit from the day before and evaluate all merchandise. Once that is done I would then designate assignments for the account managers.
good,"I feel that this is a fair and good company to work for but however I  see that the rent to own business is on a decline and is making cutbacks. Stores are closing and stocks are going down. I don't want to be a part of a dying business, Id rather work full-time for a company that's going up"
good,great work life blance   but do not get comfortable they are very cut throught and will not think twice about throw you under the bus for just about anything
good,"The Legal Department was not micromanaged. I enjoyed the fact that I would come into work, do my job and go home with little to no distraction. Everyone on the team knew what their job was. "
good,While I was there staff was excellent good work environment job hours were alright need better health care and a set way to do things ur work is pretty much based on u
good,When applying for this job be prepared for this to be your life! Very long hours and diverse jobs including moving furnerature and appliances. Also networking and customer management is very important.
good,Dealing with employees and customers generally enjoyable. Collections are difficult and not enjoyable. Sales is enjoyable part of job. Management of the company can be really good at times. This a large company so this can be difficult at times to submit ideas and suggestions. Hours are long but not that bad for retail.
good,"RAC is a fast paced and streasfull job at sometimes but its good for people who like to gogogogo. The stressfull part is dealing the the ignorance of the customer, but you just got to learn how to let things go and not let them get to u and continue being reapectfull to that person. If you can do that u wont have any issues."
good,"Rent A Center is a good company to work for, however, not competitive with wages. Work life balance is needed to retain great talent. Always have split days off due to being closed every Sunday."
good,This company is one of the best i ever work for in my career in rent to own i will love to go back an make my career with them they are great overall great customer service great benefits great401k
good,"Was an assistant store manager here for almost 1 year before deciding to pursue a career. My time with RAC was not an overall bad experience, but some managers and district managers are more about the numbers than the value of customers and employees."
good,i maintained sales setup of the sales floor delivery and account follow ups.  i also ran service calls made calls for deliquent accounts.  I made cold calls for customers on special deals to create more sales.
good,"Company needs to look more at where upper management is going. Not enough changes are happening, but expectations are. The company needs to get back to its old culture and attract quality employees while adjusting to today's technologies."
good,"as long as you get along why people you should be good. with that being said, if you feel like co-workers have some kind of special treatment, watch out who you tell, i would recommend going straight to the district manager."
good,"I love this place but they can be very tough to work for if you survive the first 3 years. Lots of bad direction and point of sale system etc. they offer great wage n pay, also a great place to develop a ton of different skills since your a jack of all trades here, and I mean all trades. Management has slowly changed to micromanagement recently. Overall I'd say give them a try but it will be a challenging experience"
good,I was an assistant manager here at rent a center it was all organized fun and a very respectful but then new store manager came in and everything went down hill disrespectful no type of care for customers I really did not understand how he was a store manager
good,Fun place to work. Good work environment for the most part. Few bad spots but overall good company to work for and excellent for work and home life to go together.
good,Load up truck for deliveries to customer's homes setup appliances and TV's if needed. Never in the same place always going somewhere different. Good work environment.
good,This company offers growth from within and a competitive wage.  Advancement takes time due tot he saturation of employees as many people in this industry are what we call lifers and have limited ability to adapt to other industries.
good,The workplace was a great environment to be in due to the employees.  It was a home away from home.  The hours were long but I enjoyed being there because of the employees and the customers.
good,"Overall a well rounded place of employment, I appreciate the knowledge I gained from the wide variety of situations that were put upon me. i wouldn't take it back."
good,"can be challanging at times but great paid work out and if u like to"
good,We have had a ton of mismanagement and the results have finally caught up with us. Directors/VP/SVP/EVPs are hit or miss.  Some are extremely talented while others are complete idiots.  The work culture has become more relaxed which is nice and i have had a very good work life balance but I know of others that are worked into the ground.  I had a lot of high hopes in terms of professional advancement here but the current company performance has made those aspirations quite a bit out of reach.  I would not be surprised if I get let go this year.
good,Salary pay with overtime. Good people to work for. Very helpful and lots of room for advancement. Well organized in their operations.You do work long hours but helping people get new furniture and seeing the looks on their faces is worth it. Great training on product knowledge.
good,"Work in a fast-paced and physically engaging environment where you manage a daily delivery schedule to safely and securely load, deliver and install appliances, electronics and furniture in customer’s homes and educate customers on how to operate their new items.  responsible for in-store merchandising."
good,"Company is changing. Harder to meet standards. Margins reduced,  standard  same. New upper management taking company in a Direction that is unable to sustain itself."
good,"Working for Rent A Center consisted of calling all of our past due customers, checking the daily planner for deliveries and pick ups, and going by the pat due customers homes for payment or return of merchandise."
good,una empresa donde lo principal es dar el resultado independientemente de lo que tengas que hacer en tu vida personal que de alguna manera te lo timan en cuenta.
good,A great job for younger person. Every day is something new. If you like getting out and seeing new things this would be for you. Job can be very physical at times. And just like everything it has its good and bad points. But my over all it was more fun than not.
good,"Set daily activity planner for employees to ensure productivity for the day. Assist all employees to ensure work is 100% complete. Conduct meetings, inventory audits, sales and collections calls, train and develop current  and new employees, timekeeping, projections for upcoming month, maintain expense ledger to 100%. Hardest part of job was to deny potential new customers from renting merchandise."
good,"Lo que mas me gusto es que aprendí los procesos que llevan al cierre de venta, los colegas buena relación laboral, la parte mas difícil no respetar horarios no por parte de la empresa si no de la gerencia directamente."
good,I acquired lot of exposure with my co-employees and helped me to learn more technical knowledge. The good workers will be acknowledged when they meet or exceed expectations.
good,"Assisting Customers in the store and providing financing and terms while verifying each purchase application. Supervising all sales staff, and reviewing all sales applications from each sales person."
good,"Rent a center is a great place if you are looking to learn new things. while at rent a center you will be task with meeting a greeting customers on the sales floor, setting up delivery date and time, delivering the merchandise. You will also be in tasked with collecting money and coaching customers about on-time payments. Not to place to work if you are bothered by favoritism. In the year I have spent with the company one of the biggest things I was troubled by was the fact that some get better treatment than others."
good,Very stressful at times due to the retail environment and account management duties. There is always something to do. Very good job for employees that do not have families. Only a good job for employees with families. There have been recent changes to the staffing model where the company is hiring three part-time co-workers to handle the roadwork and store cleaning/restocking. The full-time co-workers are having their hours reduced from 47 hours per week down to 40 hours per week to try and improve the work/life balance. Good benefits.
good,"I worked with this company for a very long time but I had to walk away. While there is a ton of advancement opportunity, it all depends on your manager. I had a great manager at one location who devoted his work to his customers and coworkers. I had to move to another location where they just hired a fresh MIT and I had to do all his task for him while he barked more orders at me."
good,My day included collections and sales. Learned how to manage people. Love working as a team. Hardest part is long hours every day.
good,rent a center gave me more knowlage on sales acounts and steres gave me the chance to learn how to balance my personal live with bussiness live also to help people in difrent areas of needs.
good,"Typical day for me, organizing and following through on daily activities also assist with maintaining a quality showroom for the public.  Accurately ordered new products and ensured that merchandise was kept in rent ready condition. Prepared and delivered bank deposits daily. Training coordinator to all new hires."
good,"A typical work day include, morning huddle with staff outlining what we need to get done to reach our goal for the day,reviewing previous day numbers and making adjustments as needed and following up on staff to make sure we stay on track to to reach the day's goals. I learn as a manager that if thing do not turn out as plan on any day I have regroup and start planning for the next day and also how to manage different personalities in regards to my co-workers. In my previous job we had to do collection to order to hit our goals and that was the hardest part of the job. I enjoy interacting with customers I was able to have great relationship with them, we would talk about thing that was not related to business they would ask me for my advice which I was glad to give but my greatest reward that I have is to have employee that left to further their career else where send me a emails, cards and calls about the influence that I have in their personal and professional lives and thanking me for that."
good,"Good place to work, demanding schedule with room for growth. Two weeks vacation after a year of service. Multi tasking required."
good,Overall a nice place to move up. I was able to utilize a lot of learned skills. The staff I worked with were very helpful and friendly.
good,"This was a great company and fun job. I loved working with these people. it was all hard work but it was always fun, so it made the day go by so fast. They were big on keeping the employee happy and healthy. If ever you or your family member was sick rest assure you could call in sick and they would be ok with it."
good,"You get to help people. you really get to learn how to speak to people and handle situations. The employees are great, good place to start"
good,This was a good job during one of the toughest job markers in the recent years. I really appreciate the chance to have worked for a great company during hard times. I have nothing but good things to remember from my bosses and co-workers.
good,It a place where you have several opportunities to move up in the work field. A regular day consists of a lot of sales calls taking payments and moving around furniture.
good,Start the day by having morning meetings and and then making call-thru to current customers to ensure on-time payments and prospect new customers.Then the daily planner of scheduled deliveries for the day.
good,I actually like working at rent a center the pay was okay it was just never having a weekend off is kind of depressing. This a job for a older person with no personal life.n
good,"Not a bad place to work."
good,A typical day flies by by helping out customers find the products they need and want to make their home better.  Everyone works hard to fit customer needs and get them delivered and set up as quickly as possible.  The hardest part of the job is making sure you have the right fit for their budget as not to over extend our customers.
good,"The benefits are Excellent. They train you and promote from with in. If you like sales, this is a great place to work because RAC is sales driven and all about the numbers. You really get to know your customers. If you are a people person this is good."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of helping customers choose merchandise for their homes, with their payments and making the showroom floor look presentable. The hardest part of the job was helping to deliver when I had to. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping people."
good,"My days usually consisted of making phone calls and running past due customers. On occasion I'd be asked to help with a delivery which is no big deal. I learned a lot about debt collecting from RAC and had some very good people training me. I loved the people I worked with at my original location, however our store was destroyed by a tornado and we were all placed in a new location. Thankful I had job security as they could've easily let us go, however the new DM and Manager had a completely different set of rules than we were used to. If you can adapt quickly to change and high demands, while working at a faster than normal pace, this is the job for you. If you have a family that you enjoy spending time with, this is not the job for you. Some days require 12 plus hours."
good,Worked well with my school schedule. Has many ways of learning system. Well organized inventory
good,"There were never two days alike, which made it interesting and fun. I expanded my knowledge on many levels with this company."
good,"A typical day included calls to customers, payments taken, furniture delivery and assembly."
good,"I wouldn't recommend Rent-A-Center to anyone with a family. The company requires a minimum of 8 hours overtime per week, 10 if you're an Assistant Manager or higher. You are compensated for the extra time, but it's hard if you have a family that you want to spend time with as well. The work is relatively difficult as you're basically required to move furniture all day long in and out of people's houses. The pay and benefits are descent."
good,"I worked as a salesmen and delivery man for the first year when I was chosen for an assistant manager position. My responsibilities were extensive and included sales, deliveries, merchandise service, and maintaining inventory. I was also responsible for collection calls when payments were missed. My coworkers were strong and reliable. The hardest part of the job was having to repossess merchandise that benefitted the customers children. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was dealing with the customers on the phone and in their homes."
good,Typical day consists of working about 12 hours a day 5 days a week. The hardest part of the job is meeting your weekly expectations in sales. As account manager i learned a lot such as writing legal letters and better understanding on the computer. Co-workers are wonderful . The best part of job is your always around new people and there is always contests going on
good,"A typical work day consisted of calling customer accounts upon past due and current payments of rental products. Loading and unloading the company work truck with company merchandise. Insuring on time product delivery or repossessions. What I have learned was the importance of problem solving with customer accounts and insuring a safe work environment for myself and my co-workers. I worked with an excellent Store manager who was able to help me with any issues i may have had. He helped me to learn new things that i was never familiar with from my previous work experiences. As for my co-workers, i worked with an excellent team of intelligent individuals who not only helped me at times needed but that I was able to correlate with as individuals. The hardest part of this job was problem solving in ways that suited our customers needs. The most enjoyable part was being able to go out on our routes and finding new locations in which i have never been to."
good,"I was an account manager. I was responsible for calling and collecting on rentals and at times having to go and pick them up and deliver rentals. Co-Workers were good to work with, management in store was difficult to deal with at times, upper management was good."
good,Work from as early as 8am and would not leave until almost 9pm. Conduct proper collection calls and procedures. Assist customers with new or renewal of rental agreements. I enjoyed my co-workers and management. The hardest part of the job would be closing a route at times. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the interaction with customers.
good,Long hours for work schedule but off every Sunday and Most Holidays. Opportunity for advancement is plenty but you have to know the right people or they will not recognize you. Good thing is you will get a raise every 6 mos!!
good,I like a typical day at work. Everything from talking to customers to making deliveries. The only downside are the long hours.
good,"My regular routine at work when I arrive in the morning is to open the store and set all the alarms so it wont send out signals. I get on my call throughs in the morning to ensure that customers are reminded of payments due. I then write my reports and send them off to our district manager. I help out on the floor with rent ready so it will be presentable to customers once they walk in. In doing all of these tasks, I enjoy my coworkers compatibility and their motives and moods. It makes everything enjoyable to do. Management needs some work but overall its stable and has restrictions for the fellow workers. The hardest part of the job is delivering furniture to customers home. After the day, I always learn something from it..whether its handling customers complaints or adjusting prices or monitoring accounts..It's a job filled with laughter but at the same time, if you can't handle angry customers, then it's on you..I've had no problem dealing with any type of customer.."
good,"Rent A Center is as great as a job as you want it to be. Advancement is great, pay is good, but if your looking to spend time with your significant other or children this is not the job for you."
good,"Typical day at work is around 10 to 11 hours a day, meeting new customers and personalities on daily basis. Working for RAC I learned to develop understanding and patience for people who don't have credit and use this resource. Being a Asst Mgr, also I stepped up and was able to make smart decision with employees and customers. The hardest part of the job is that you work between 45 to 50 hrs a week, so if you have family you will only get to see them few hrs a week..Its fun, you become part of the family of RAC."
good,"It is the same daily task, I have learned a lot about customer service. I enjoy my management and co-workers because they are family too."
good,"Busy, Driving Around, Deliveries, Great Co Workers. Making Calls Dealing With Great Customers, Alot Of People That Like To Make your job worth it."
good,"I would come in and review the numbers from previous day and look to see who did a great job and who needs to have some help and travel to that location and or call and get team fired up and ready for a new day. I would send company roll down to all 7 stores and ensure we all were on the same page, i would perform visits everyday to stores that i need to see. I would always try to hit all 7 stores within a 2 week span. I dealt with every customer service issues for all 7 stores and worked to resolve them. I did all interviews for district and sourcing and when i found the right person i offered them a job with our company. I also ensured all 7 stores stayed within the 48 hours a week or 50 hours a week pending on position. Any other training or questions were handled thru me."
good,"Every job has there down fall. Honeslty, this job depends on what rent a center you work at. I loved my job until I transfered to another location. Good pay, great benifits, employee fianacing and paid holidays."
good,"I enjoyed my job and the money I made, but I worked so much I missed out on alot of time with my children. The people I worked with in the beginning were amazing, but managment changed and work became a little overwhelming. I was able to learn account managment skills and fine tune my customer service skills. When you deal with past due accounts you have to have a little something extra in my opinion."
good,Show up ten minutes earlier if possible and make sure that I would not fall back with work at all. I learned to identify Customer wants and needs and wants also learned how to make Caramel from scratch to a full batch .The type of environment that i worked with was really amazing in the fact that all my coworkers where really helpful and fast phase helpers.If I would to describe a hardest part of my job I would have to say the lack of the management skills that were not followed as far as our expectations.One of the best qualities of that employment would have to be the fact that my hours where set and that everyone there at the time we always very friendly and energetic.
good,"I learned a lot from Rent-A-Center, and I have grown to love all of my employees and enjoy working with them. This job takes up a lot of time, and there is no flexibility in scheduling, and that's why I have to find something different now, because I am in school. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the unhappy customers, but once you smooth things over with them, everything is all good. The most enjoyable part would be having Sundays off."
good,"Rent-A-Center was a more enjoyable place to work. There was a lot of variety in the job such as making phone calls, staging furniture, delivery, repossessing, and sales. For a small-town job the pay was over $2 per hour higher than most of the jobs around town. There was definitely room for advancement such as promoting to assistant manager or manager, however, there was a poor balance in work hours vs personal life. Company requires 48 hours per week and the company offers only split days off. Overall, this was an enjoyable place to work."
good,as long as you can stay true to the company. you will do fine here. but you have to be good at collections and customer service and also willing to work some long hours
good,I enjoyed working for this company just the fact that i liked working with customers. Management was very friendly at times. The only thing wrong with this company is the hours. i worked just about 60hrs a wk and the some how like to shorted my hours.
good,"Excellent career opportunity and room for advancement for skilled, dedicated young professionals."
good,"Open work environment with some opportunities to work from home. Great place to start a call center, administrative, or corporate career with lots of opportunities to join other sides of the business."
good,"Rent-a-center as a whole has helped me grow as a person. They strive for daily greatness, weekly greatness, and yearly greatness. This in turn though causes alot of stress and criticsm if its not all going as planned."
good,"My reason for leaving was:  Management was new to creating routes with multiple stops.  All five drivers were refined to a four work day, forty hour work week, no exceptions.  After the bean counters reorganized my route three times,  I was consistently around 46 hours for the week driving in the city and running 680 miles per week, I could not shave the hours to 40 so management would constantly harass me and belittle me.  I just got tired of it after six months and quit."
good,"Rent A Center wasn’t too bad of a company to work for, my original manger was really nice great person made work worth the time! He also was very organized, most recent management was all over the place"
good,I enjoyed working at Rent-A-Center because the education they provide regarding their product was really detailed I like that there was room for growth and opportunity I do not like all the crazy hours but with retail I guess that's expected .if you're looking to work with Rent-A-Center I think it's a great opportunity
good,"Work Life Balance is difficult with mandatory Saturdays, overall the job and employees are great and it's a fun, rewarding place to work. I would work there again in a heartbeat if as a manager there was more flexibility with working weekends."
good,I've been working here for 2 years and not a lot has really changed. Corporate is threatening jobs. I've put my heart and soul in to this company.  No recognition what zo ever.
good,"Very tense work,company still growing..Managent dont care much about their employess.Long hours and hostile enviroment with customers sometimes.Benefits  was not the best but you seem to advance rapidly in the company"
good,Rent a center is great company to work for if they were to put the employees first sometimes but they don’t the pay is ok and the benefits are great but it is to much stress on a daily basis
good,Learn a lot from coworkers and sales team. Fast and always something new to learn. You stayed busy and you build customer relationships. Always rewarding to see.
good,The job is physically demanding but it dose have its benefits. The only thing I had trouble understanding is why was there soo much trouble promoting people when positions came open and they took people right off the streets
good,It can be stressful at times but so can any jobs. You are expected to perform your duty's without being micro managed. Worse part about the job is all the phonecalls you have to make.
good,"its a very relaxing nice job longs you get the work done, the best part about rent a center is driving the box truck and van traveling to different locations. and the employees were mad chill so i recommend this job to anyone that is willing to make a nice living"
good,Great company to work for. Good benefits. Long hours. Great relationships with customers. Feels good to help solve customers problems. Love working with customers and helping them achieve ownership
good,The staff is enjoyable to work with and learn from. The busy season is slightly stressful but the coworkers make up for it. Management went out of the way to thank you for good work.
good,"As an experienced person in the workforce; RAC gave me new tools to utilize in my future development and secure higher level positions. "
good,"I couldn't handle working until 7 every night and never having 2 days off in a row, other than that it is a great place to work. You will draw new perspectives on what you think the job is and how you look at customers. Definitely a family atmosphere. If you do not need lots of time with family, then this is a great opportunity for a great career."
good,"Some days long. But with the right crew you can be a winning team!"
good,expect to work 10-12hrs per day. company goals are demanding but they are really good about taking advice from the field on what is working and what is not. If it isn't working they will modify it or take it away. Most stores are franchised and ran to benefit their coworkers and customers. It is a fun and exciting job for retail. The stressful part is collections.
good,i would get there and run the deliveries or take the truck and put it in the computer then refurbish the incoming produce or assemble it on the floor. i would then break it down and bring it to peoples homes and set it up. in the store i would take payments and help move product
good,"A day at RAC starts with team meetings always. Everybody needs an understanding of where the store currently stands and our goal for the day. I've learned that if you have a strong team behind you, your goals can be accomplished but its up to you to build your teams moral. The hardest part of the job was getting the problematic customers to make on time payments. The part that I enjoyed was when the team pulled together and overcame the obstacles. We came up with ways to either meet the customers half way by going to pick up the payment from them or asking them to pay half or whatever it took for the store to close with the company expectations of us."
good,"17 years of my life was given to this company, I thank them for what I’ve learned, I started in 2002 as an account manager, calling customers that where past due and delivering products to their home, assistant manager in 2004-2005-store manager 2005-2017 district manger 2017-2019 thanks for the opportunity to better the lives of our coworkers and customers!"
good,"typical day at work doing calls and working on credit"
good,Company sold in April and let me go 2 months before my ten year anniversary instead of offering me another position.  It was a shock and a huge blow to me and my family.
good,Just a lot of hours and not enough time for my four kids but overall it was a nice job..  the bosses were nice. We had a half hour lunch. We always kept the show room floor clean but our back room was packed
good,The job can be very fun. The employees become closer due to small amount of employees. Time off can be hard to come by and other people have to pick up the slack sometimes. Schedule is fixed and deliveries can get overwhelming at times.
good,"Great job,  learn to tele market deal with stressful customers able to move around appliances. Great benefits. Long hours, can get stressful at times since managers push sales."
good,"overall not bad, I knew what to expect from upper management. I was truthfully about job duties, however the pay did not work out to be what told to me prior to being hired and it took 3 weeks to get my first check, I was lost in the system"
good,"Decent place to work, sometimes the hard work pays off, other times not as much. The insurance is okay, still not as good as state insurance. The pay isn't terrible, however it is not enough to support a family in this area below store manager level. That being said they have the WORST HR of any place I have ever worked."
good,"Awesome place to work! Flexible hours, and yearly raises! Awesome benefits and great coworkers! The only thing is you have to deal with irate customers a lot but most are great to work with!"
good,Great place to make a career although not for everyone if you can handle the rent to own environment it’s great experience. They provide training and offer coaching opportunities. Management is great.
good,"It was as a great experience gained and I would love the opportunity to return and rejoin the team full time."
good,"Me encantaba Rent a center, ambiente de trabajo muy bueno, la relación con mis compañeros y gerentes excelente, el salario para mi muy bueno, oportunidad de crecer, yo empecé de vendedora y terminé como subgerente y claro podía haber llegado a ser gerente en esta empresa,  solo que es mucho tiempo para mi, el horario es lo único que no me gustaba y claro mientras mayor era el rango más tiempo le dedicaba a el trabajo y casi no tenia vida social. "
good,"Good job , I would recommend this job to anyone as long as you can pick up couches , washers and dryers. Other than that it’s going to be a piece of cake"
good,"Being apart of management was very exciting and stressful, but starting from a delivery driver and showing others how well I can do, helped with my advancements"
good,Rant Center ha sits ups and downs depending on Manager of the store your at.I happend to have two managers who had no problem getting their hands dirty in the field and no problem giving good raises
good,It was my first job and I enjoyed my time there. Management was very good and my schedule was very flexible. The pay wasn't amazing but for entry level part-time position I can't complain to much.
good,job is consistent but it becomes a dead end there job became very respective to do the same thing so that's why working on the job became more boring needed achallenge
good,I was with the company while it was corporate owned. Then stayed after it was sold. The new owners are Impact. Great company to work for if the regional managers are as helpful as the upper management. Not everyone values their job. I was lucky to have a great staff.
good,"Great place to work at if you like interacting with others. Love to help others in obtaining what they worked hard for. No credit checks, and same day delivery"
good,"ok., wasnt too happy about alot of things, but not too sad either. Company is competing heavy because they dont want to get bough out. May happen, may not."
good,I am glad to say that my department and managers had been really supportive in my job. They openness to listen and work together to make things happen is been great.
good,"In the position I was in, I was able to implement technologies as I felt fit...as long as I could prove its capabilities and usefulness. I was never micro-managed which allowed me to create/run a team that I was very proud."
good,"Overall Rent-A-Center is a great company to make a career choice. With great benefits and pay, may opportunities to move up in the ranks of the company."
good,"I learn how to manage an account and help the customer as much as I could, and asure to make the customer has happy as they can be. Doing so they recommended more customers and they would bring are accounts up."
good,Rent-A-Center prepared me to be a better professional. I learned that there is also a balance between being high tech and having high interpersonal skills.
good,"Overall pretty good job to get on your feet with. There are great benefits, great people to work with, and the weekly pay is just a cherry on top. It is a very fast pace position and it also requires great communication/people skills and patience, when dealing with an angry customer."
good,"Directed activities concerned with selection​ of telephone facilities and special equipment on customers​, premises to meet customer's communication requirement"
good,Rent A center promotes from within as long as you show passion you will promote . The benefits are wonderful. The only bad thing would be the life and work balance.
good,"It completely depends on were you go. When I was in Cadillac I loved it, not as much when I moved to Colorado. Over all the company is good when things are going well, but when things don't and people stop paying it cuts into your home life by making you stay late to try to get those payments."
good,Nice place to work kool people no room for growth. In my opinion I rather be driving doing house calls. Company is diverse get to cross-trained on all appliances and electronics.
good,"Rent a center was a very good job to work for when it came down to pay and benefits..I was on salary so I had to work 40-50 plus hours weekly.  The management team had just started to ask the store managers to work on Sundays, which would have been 7 days straight and I could not do that so I resigned."
good,RAC is fast-paced and never boring. You have to be agile and flexible to change or you'll be very unhappy here. Good people to work with. Communication can be a bit of a challenge and technology is a bit underrated.
good,"I liked working at rent a center.  I got plenty of hours, worked with good people, met new people every day.  The work is hard, moving furniture and appliance was hard and talking on the phone working with people to get their rent in time was hard, but I enjoyed doing it and would do it again in a heart beat."
good,Working for this company was a good company to work for. Management treats everyone fairly and with respect. I do recommend hiring more employees because the job entails lifting furniture and other heavy items. There seems to be a high turnover rate as a result of this.
good,Every day was phone calls and then more calls or knocking on doors. it was a sad life and im glad i can move on to better things. not held back by $..
good,"It's a great company, just wish they would have a little higher salary. Would wish they would have less hours for management to be able to have a better work/life balance. I was in the acceptance now subdivision, the hours are very different as the employees have to work the Host store hours, which are 930am to 9pm. While the host store employees are getting better pay for doing the same thing we do and working the same hours."
good,In the time I was with company I learned how to manage time and the importance of image.  And attention to detail is very important to every day function
good,"Rent A Center was always very laid back, the kind of place where as long as the work was getting done then you might as well have some fun while you did it. Music was always playing even when the District Manager would come in. Work team turned into more of a family as long as we got work done."
good,Within a couple of years we went from a Start up agency to being in the top 10 Agencies in Dallas. Atmosphere was fun and inviting. Tried to maintain a good work life balance for all their employees.
good,"Typical day consisted of getting to the store early and getting ready past due accounts pulled that needed my representatives attention as to making outbound calls to collect on. I would also oversee the sales team in the store and make sure we were continuing hitting our daily, weekly and monthly goals in both sales and collection. My responsibilities also included deposits, staff meetings and projections for the month and year."
good,"Not a bad place to work at. Men mostly do deliveries and collections with some sales. Women mostly do sales and sales calls / collection calls. Must be comfortable moving heavy appliances and couches since recliners have metal frames and are heavy. Daily activity varies"
good,working at RAC is great especially if you like a change of pace during the day. In the mornings you call the route that is assigned to  you. During the early afternoon you are focused on sales and you load the truck up for any deliveries. In the later part of the day is when you're out on the road completing those deliveries.
good,Great benefits. Lots of room for advancement. Most of the upper level executives started as entry level account managers. Can be a frustrating business and feels like preying on the weak at times.
good,"Gosh long hours mon-sat"
good,"Typically work twelve hours a day for five days a week, but do not get paid overtime; only get paid for the hours that you work, but you get paid fairly well. Saturdays are mandatory. The work environment is good as there aren't many employees to one store, so you get to know everyone you work with. Typical day starts with making phone calls to delinquent accounts early in the morning until noon then you leave to deliver any merchandise that customers came in to rent. The hardest part about the job was calling the delinquent accounts to try to get them to pay or return the merchandise; sometimes you come across some nasty individuals who do not like to be called. The most enjoyable was just the overall work environment."
good,"It was a good place to work, however; the paid can be better. I had great store district manager. Training now to be more effected. The benefits was great"
good,"Okay place to work. I feel as though the pay does not match up with amount of work and dedication required. Overall, I recommend this as a good temporary job."
good,Was a great place to work.  Management worked with you through issues.  Great benefits.  Training program was easy to to use while I was training new hires
good,"loved the job, loved the people i worked with, i would work here again, it was a very busy and demanding job, but well worth it, can take alot of personal time, but he pay is great if a person decides to take that up."
good,learned to manage customer and staff at the same time. Dealing with difficult situation. staying calm under pressure. I have to be able to work on the weekend.
good,Good company to work for. Advancement is available at rent a center. Sometimes can be stressful but overall good management and training. The company needs to pay full time employees more
good,"I love this job however there are negatives."
good,"Muy buena experiencia, con muy buena ética laboral, desde los compañeros que te dan todas las facilidades para poder realizar bien tu trabajo, así como al jefe de departamento que nos indica de forma clara y precisa las metas a alcanzar y sobre todo, como debe ser el proceso para poder alcanzarlas"
good,"credit is the hardest thing to keep under control, mainly because we dealt with low income people with poor credit. Company is a great place to work. good benefits and decent co-workers. Lots of turnover."
good,The typical day is pretty fun. Every one gets along. Bonuses are great. Deliveries aren't the most fun. Repossession situations can be funny at times. Pay isn't that great
good,"I assisted people in buying furniture and electronics for their home, work or school. You get to meet so many different people from every walk of life. Pretty cool job!"
good,"Good company to work for. Do your job and stay with the company for a long time and you will get promoted. Job is easy, just do your assigned task."
good,I enjoyed my job up to the point where I was demoted for lack of training and a lack of experienced pds personnel.Overall I enjoyed the job.
good,"Call each customer eery morning"
good,Company keeps changing and not for the better. This is a totally different company than when i started 8 years ago. The company has a mindset of we dont need coworkers who are dedicated because we can hire anyone.
good,"Structured work environment with clear expectations."
good,"Se puede generar mucha experiencia en diversas áreas, ventas, cobranza, logística, entregas."
good,"Muy buen lugar para adquirir experiencia en logística y transporte, así como también en ventas, crédito y cobranza."
good,Very hard company to work for. Requires a lot of work and stress on a daily basis. Constantly feels like your job may be at risk due to extreeme expecations from the company. At times could be a very dangerous job. All that aside the company does compensate you accordingly. Gives great oppurtunites to kids that may not have the college education  to grow in a company.
good,"I used my thinking and social skills a lot with this job, but the long hours are not fun. While the work environment is challening and kept me busy, I got sick of working every weekend and holiday."
good,"A typical day at Rent-A-Center started at 8:30 AM and ended 7:30 at night. Mandatory 50 hours per week. Being the assistant sales manager insured minimal dead lines everyday. The location required 30 contracted sales each week. With only five employees to a store, job descriptions blended together, everyone did a little of everything. Helped with bill collections, deliveries, plan-o-grams, unloading freight, etc.."
good,"Answering customer questions, resolving issues was something I enjoyed. Customers satisfaction is what I took most pride in. Not to thrilled with the heavy lifting but, I got it done."
good,"Enjoyed physical challenge of delivering and setting up furniture and appliances. Coworkers were ok but pay was even better, even though i worked about 55 hrs per week."
good,Working for Rent A Center is one of the best experiences I have had the opportunity of being a part of. The Company itself regards its employees well and the work itself if fulfilling.
good,"The atmosphere of the store was good. I had a lot of fun working there because I was always active. Relished the fact that I was learning something new everyday. Greeting and meeting people was great, but it had its down sides when you have to drive long hours of the day so you can become exhausted pending on the trips. All in all my experience working there was well spent."
good,"I was the assistant manager at Rent-A-Center. Which I assisted with the training of new employees, collections, sales, and inventory. I thought it was a great work place and we had a motivated team. The benefits were not great."
good,"Mucho trabajo que hacer y siempre ocupados es lo mejor ,"
good,I enjoy being able to help the customers with their purchase. The hardest part of the job is moving furniture and applicances.
good,i learned to worked well with a competitive team.i mostly enjoyed interactions with all of the customers. the hardest part of the job was traveling to other rent-a-center locations.
good,"RENT A CENTER is a different type of retail as it not only allows you to buy but you can rent as well. They do not check credit as does most retailers and those with poor or no credit can get an opportunity to own quality merchandise at a price that they can afford. The overall training is getting much better and the new systems coming are going to be a big improvement over the existing system. I learned a whole different side of retail with the Collections side. It is a necessary side of the business which takes much talent and persistence. That far and away was the hardest thing for me. I truly enjoyed the Teams that I have worked with and the customers that I have made friends with, I truly will miss their conversation and fun."
good,"- Bookkeeping"
good,"The best thing about the job was you get to enjoy the fresh air."
good,I daily interacted with customers of all economic situations and enjoyed helping them obtain high quality products. My main goal of the day was to have a positive influence on someone.
good,Was customer service selling and setting up customer deliveries in a friendly timely manner. How to understand customer needs and how important time management was. With good leadership skills in a team atmosphere. Was to arrive on time for customer deliveries do to unexpected circumstances. To see customers happy and satisfied with are services.
good,Was very friendly and great working with the co-workers. WAS A GREAT LEANING EXPERIENCE ALL THE WAY AROUND.HAVE BEEN IN GROCERY RETAIL FOR THIRTY YEARS AND WAS A CHALLENGE SOMETIMES AND REALLY JUST DIFFERENT SELLING HOUSEHOLD ITEMS INSTEAD OF GROCERIES
good,"Good place to learn sales, service, and collections. While maintaining and growing your customer base. Learned a lot of skills, such as problem solving, and creating a warm atmosphere for our customers."
good,don't get me wrong I loved what I did for almost ten years but theres more negatives than positives working here. the most enjoyable time I had here was when I clocked out. your day is done when all task are completed so if you have plans later in the day its pretty much gone. your life is rent a center and rent a center only
good,"Working Culture is ok ok not great. The HR only listens to Managers rest employees are not cared. Compensation is also not great, not according to the position you hold or amount of work one does. Most of the coworkers are very good and supportive. The working mentality is not like IT, but still it's managable.."
good,"the job was as hard as you made it. You would come in do your inspection on the truck, then make your call through for the day, deliver/pick up items for/from customers. fairly easy only hard days were when you were by yourself that day. which was seldom cause management always try and have someone that could help."
good,"fun job but depending on area it can be very dangerous "
good,Overall liked this job. It was just hard when you have kids to run around but couldn't because you were stuck at work.
good,"a typical day at work ... rent and collect merchandise"
good,Account Manager is that plus delivering heavy furniture.  Going into dirty houses with roaches and bed bugs.
good,Lots of lifting and bending carrying driving.  You deal with a lot of crazy things but its not all the time that you do.  You have some good managers you will have some bad managers.  You will have good days you will have bad days.  this job can turn you best day into your worst and vice versa.  Your co workers make the job worth it though.  You build lots fo friendships with co workers you do a lot of traveling you do have numbers to meet you have to make sure that your collecting pmts from customers who have rented merch.  and its divided up between yourself and others depending on the size of the store.  Lots of eating on the road or the go.  long days your day ends at 8 and it begins at 10 or sometime 9.  Its a fast paced job so the time goes by fast.  They really love to promote and they promote from within.  Benefits are good not great but good a little too expensive and you get 2 days off and you get overtime a each week which helps in the paycheck dept.
good,Rent A Center is a great place for people looking for great benefits and looking to learn management tools. You work face to face with customers and learn hands on account management and problem solving. It is great for young people but very hard on a person with a family. Days off are split and the hours are long. Sales standards can at times be extremely hard to achieve in this economy but overall a good place to work.
good,My basic job duty was to deliver the product to the customers home.
good,"This was a decent company to work for, but it is only as good as the support of the upper management. Promotions were very good and the benefits and compensation were also good."
good,"Great enviroment and great company to work for, the compensaton wasnt that good but other than that it was ok"
good,"renting items, picking up returns, sales"
good,You work in a small group of people so you get to know them very well. You become close or enemies. The pay was not bad. You can get promoted. High Pressure Job sometimes. Monthly sales and collection goals.
good,"I would go in and start my day off with balloons and getting our products ready to sell. I learned how to be calm in stressful situations, how to communicate with customers and staff. My coworkers were funny and outgoing. My managers were helpful. The hardest part was taking back product from customers who did not want to pay. The most enjoyable part was when a couple would come in to get furniture for their first time ever and I got to help them get started in their new life."
good,"Rent a center is not a bad place to work if you don't mind long hours. Management can be a little to micro managed at points, but the co-workers make up for it."
good,"A typical day at work is 10hrs a day. I'm learning the ins and outs of the job,and the most difficult thing is getting the customers to pay their accounts. The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting and greeting the people."
good,I have worked for this company for almost seven years. It is a good place to work for. For the most part managers are great leaders and help train the staff. the best part about this job is gaining the trust of your customers and meeting a lot of new people and helping them get items they desire.
good,"Great place to work, you'll meet lots and pretty much become familiar to customers as a friend they can trust. Daily routines, at an rapid pace amongst other duties to complete before the day end made the time go by swiftly. Heavy lifting, great customer service, and building community relations is what I learned here."
good,"A typical day was 10 to 12 hours consisted of reviewing daily reports, banking transactions, sales, customer service, merchandising, inventory, collections.  I learned how to interact and handle customers based on various characteristics.  Overall, management was quite demanding which is required (somewhat) based on the nature of the job. Co-workers were great to  work with since I hired most of those who worked with me.  Hardest part of the job was to constantly maintain the sales and collections quotas set by upper management.  The most enjoyable part of the job was all of the close relationships formed as a result of working so closely with majority of the customer base."
good,Good Company to work for the hardest part of the job is working every weekend My coworkers are good team players
good,Meeting new people and selling merchandise and making delivers throughout the day. Helping my store be the best it can be and making sure my markets credit is the best.
good,"A typical work day was collections, credit analysis and delivery of products."
good,"Long hours doing collections and sales."
good,follow up on leads provided by Host store turn down list. Telemarket these leads. hardest part of job is the down time. The most rewarding part is when you write an agreement and the customer leave knowing he's able make the purchase .
good,"I had a great exprience working for rent-a-center. Although I would assume expriences would be determined by how good of a manager you had. My manager and I actually became good friends even after I left. Long hours, alot of heavy lifting, dealing with angry customers. Although if you can handle those things, it is a great place to work."
good,"credit and collections, sale, delivery and pick up of merchandise. Hard job but tons of fun. Worst part of job is being at work all day and never seeing your family."
good,"Conduct all sales and marketing for the store. Supervise and help build the abilities of customer account representatives. Store managers are very helpful at showing you the necessary steps to growing within the company. The hardest part about the job is continuously meeting expectations. However, if you do it right then that wont be an issue. It is a high energy job with plenty of interaction with customers and coworkers."
good,It was ok to work for just not a lot of time for family. I work 48+ hours and I work on Saturday. My husband works 3rds by the time I get home sometimes he eats and goes to work. The only time I get to spend with him is on Saturday and Sunday and Saturday I work until 6 or 7 so not much time there.
good,"I really enjoy working at Rent A Center, my co-workers are great we are very much like a family. My boss is awesome and I really enjoy working for him. A typical day at work is pretty busy, between generating sales, helping customers and at times going on the road. I've just recently been moved into a sales/assistant manger position. The hardest part of the job is the hours. I work 48 to 50 hours a week, which isn't the issue, the issue is working til 7PM everyday and 6PM on Saturdays, plus the job isn't what I went to school for. My ultimate goal is to find a position that gives me the financial/job security to allow my wife to quit her job and be a full time stay at home mom. I want my next job to be with a company that I can advance in and eventually retire with."
good,Telecommunications
good,This is a job that will guarantee you get great hours. You get to meet very interesting and new people each and every day and you are always busy!
good,A typical work day is to check my daily credits and overview customers. Check any delinquent accounts then follow up by home views and phone calls.
good,Employees were recognized for their efforts. They don't always understand the industry. Their pricing was double the competitors and they were losing a large share of clients to competitors. However they were good to work for and were caring and understanding when it came to family.
good,While working in the host store with RAC company I truly enjoyed what I was doing. Giving the utmost degree of customer service there was.
good,The only thing that I can says that is an issue is the fact that you don't have any time for yourself/ your family. Your schedule on Saturdays and Mondays start from 8 am to sometimes 9 pm. You get one day off during the week and every Sunday off. At starting level you get 48 hours every week. When you move up in the company to an assistant you get 50 hours a week. You get paid hourly and get paid every week. If your looking to go to school and study this is not the job for you.
good,"helped customers in tight situations in which they cant buy merchadise at the store right there and then. excellent products and top of the line merchandise. very friendly environment. manager was awesome and always looked to make things better,"
good,"Customer oriented place. Build relationships with customers. Management was good, sometimes pushed hard for results, but appreciated success. Co-workers were great. Hardest part of job was collections. Most enjoyable was sales."
good,Fun fast constantly changing work enviroment with plenty of opputunitys to assist customers.
good,"A typical day at work was making collection calls, delivering merchandise, making sales, and tidying up the store. I learned good sales techniques and collection techniques. management and co-workers were great. Hardest part of the job was the physical strain of lifting and moving furniture and the most enjoyable part of the job was the variety in duties."
good,"Collections, pick-ups, deliveries, and store appearance. I learned to be more stern when necessary and to say no in order to maintain collection numbers. The most difficult part of the job was the hours, leaving no time for family and friends. The best part of the job was the competitiveness and camaraderie of the crew."
good,Company is good and hours/pay is very good. Able to move up and get promoted.
good,Overall its a fair job depending on the management skills of the branch you worked in.
good,A company effective at the rent to own businnes. Truly enjoyed training with the District Managers but did not care for the lack of guidance towards the end of my short history with the company. Was impressed by the profit margin.
good,This job was great for when I didn't have children because hours were guaranteed and pay was great. However once I had a child the hours started to interfere with my home life.
good,"I like working for Rent A Center, it has good values, lots of advancement opertunities, and great people."
good,"Was overall a good place to work. Better suited to single people, the hours got long when your family was expecting you for events."
good,A great organization to work for and many locations to find a place to work at. Easy to come in and get started with a group of hardworking individuals. Easy transition within the company to elevate your position.
good,It was a great experience working with RAC I learn a lot and part of my knowledge is because of what I learn at the company.  The company focus on our development and training.
good,The job offered something new and interesting everyday. There was never a boring day at RAC. The customers made it all worth while. The smiles you got from them were genuine.
good,Good company to work for. Plenty of options to move up. Good pay. Great balance in work and time off. Good benefits. Great discount. Good work wnvironment
good,"Loved working with this company, very fasts paced and very competitive. Great experience and would definitely recommend joining RAC to others. They taught me many great techniques in sales."
good,"I started as a Sales Assistant Manager and was promoted to Store Manager in a year. I learned a ton so far from my district managers and fellow store managers and continue to learn everyday. If you are a hard worker you are rewarded. You build a genuine relationship with many customers which is nice. The only thing that is not ideal for me personally about this job are the hours. You work 9-7 5 days a week sometimes 8:30-7:30., it's hard managing time with your family."
good,Must be a people person in this business.   You develop a strong relationship with the customers and even their kids.   There's a sense of pride  in enriching the lives and living conditions of others.  Advancement is strongly encouraged.
good,"Worked there for 15 years. I learned a lot, especially customer service, how makes phone calls and sales. Like I said before a lot of years and sacrifices."
good,"Rent A Center is as the summary says, a fun, yet tiring place to work. What I mean by that is the environment, people, place and furniture assembly is all fun. Lifting and moving heavy furniture is the tiring part, but also fun. The only downside about working at Rent A Center is the hours, you're not given enough of them. Other than that Rent A Center is a great place to work."
good,"In my experience working for Rent-A-Center has been a great way for me to learn different aspects of the rent to own business. I started out as a Customer Account Representative, and within my first year was promoted to Credit Manager. I stayed in this position for 5 years and recently swit hed to Sales Manager to help me learn both sides of the business. I plan to get promoted to store manager within the next year."
good,"The work is doable and easy at RAC, but the type of work does not cater to all types of people. While the sales team and store is fun to work in, the sales system and clientele are not easy to work with."
good,Good company to work for if you are looking for full time work with benefits following soon after hire. however once hired you wont have much free time
good,"The job itself is a great job ,love the company. The schedule is set at 40 . It's a hard driving fun job that you will love and hate at the same time."
good,After a few years I was finally promoted. I had a disagreement about staffing which led to me lesving.   It is unfortunate I did enjoy my career there but it is top heavy .
good,Rent A Center is a great company to work for if you are a guy are single lol I wouldn't advice it for women that have a young family but if you are motivated are can juggle that time the money can be made the benefits are out of this world and you will move up in the company in no time.  I love my RAC Family.
good,It was a great opportunity to be in charge of a great team of employees. We were successful because we all had daily meeting on how to be successful in all aspects of the retail business.
good,"Enjoyed my time at RAC.  Met great people and still keep in touch with many."
good,"Great job if you're physically fit. High pressure sales & collections. Pays well, good advancement opportunities. Versatile skill set required: customer service skills, sales skills, physical fitness to name just a few"
good,Good place to work. Room for advancement and growth. Good Benefits. Paid time off. Opportunity for advancement. Promotes within. Good job stability. Overall good Company.
good,i enjoy what i do but hours of operations make it hard to make plans if you have a family. physically demanding at some points. lots of  driving time.
good,I had a good time working a Rent-A-Center. It was a new adventure everyday. It just got a bit too dangerous so I decided to more on. This was not fault of theirs.
good,"buena empresa, aqui no funciona el si tienes un papel academico sobresales, aqui funciona el lo sabes hacer, te interesa aprender, te promueven a un mejor puesto de trabajo, lo unico malo son los horarios muy pesados de 7 am hasta que el cuerpo aguante."
good,"At RAC the best thing about the job for me was helping others. We provide things that people can't always get somewhere else. Making their day, made mine. People on a fixed income can't just go out a buy a fridge, but they can count on RAC to help provide that to them without faulting them for their past credit mistakes. We don't build a relationship on credit, we build it on trust."
good,Make sure sales floor was tidy. Deliveries and pick ups. Customer representative. The hardest part of the job was telemarketing. What I enjoyed the most was floor sales. Interacting with people.
good,"i had a good time as a product delivery specialist at RAC, I just wish there could have been promotions within the delivery field. The only way to move up within the company is to either work in the field of credit or sales."
good,"This job is multi-tasking in diverse ways. It will train you in collections, sales, customer service skills,and collections. RAC have amazing benefits."
good,Working at R.A.C. many job skills you will learn. From preserving the merchandise to account managing. It also gave me a very good sense of how to deal with customers in any situation as well over adversity.
good,"team driven environment where time flies and you never find yourself without anything to do. Both productive from in store, to deliveries to customers home."
good,"Great work experience and co-workers were fun to work with. They might of have been some ups and downs, but I used to enjoy my time working at this place."
good,Working here was busy and very focused on problem solving. Customer service skills were a must. I answered calls along with emails to resolve customer service issues. The best part of the job was being able to resolve customer issues with customer retention. It was fast and furious!
good,"Rent-A-Center was definitely a change of environment for me, In my first 3+ years there I was involved in merchandise delivery/collections in/at customers' homes which at times could be nothing short of intense, especially on the collections end of the stick. I did learn how to employ verbal skills to diffuse tense situations. I did appreciate how the Store Manager would stand with us Account Managers when situations arose from our collection efforts. The coworkers there were generally team oriented and ""had your back"". The most difficult aspect there had to be trying to find and collect stolen merchandise, which oddly enough was the most rewarding aspect when you were able to bring it back to the store."
good,"I enjoyed the environment and the drive to succeed as a team as well as an individual , Meeting goals daily and weekly. The overall management recognized effort ."
good,My job was very relaxed even in the most stressful time. I enjoyed working for my mangers and they understand any issues that needed me to work around my home and job.
good,Typical day would begin with calls to past due accounts in a attempt to get payment or items scheduled to be returned. Followed by making calls to regular customer to check on them and their merchandise or new customers given to us by regulars or the company.
good,"Sales, deliveries, assembly of merchandise and floor models. work as a team as well as be able to work on your own. Accounts payable and receivables. Repossessions of unpaid merchandise."
good,fast paced alot of interaction with customers it was just a good job if you like customer service and great store attitude with great co workers and district managers
good,Ita a okay place to  work for if you could deal with people's attitude and lack of respect. They are a good company but just some customers are rude and not easy going
good,"I actually love working for this company. I have found really good people who have become great friends of mine. Its a busy place, But allows for very quick days. The long hours aren't a problem. Means for a good paycheck and I have a lot of fun while working. I have moved up in the company fairly quickly. That being said moving up further means I have to wait for an opening. That can take some time where I am at In my career. This also wouldn't be a problem aside from the managers are currently not helping in my efforts to learn the job that I am currently in and where I want to go next. Even with me asking my supervisor and his Frequently. This is where I am begining in my search for something new."
good,it is a very interesting place to get knowledge about customer service and account management and people. the hardest part is to work with managers that cant take an opinion to improve and to make work a better place.
good,Es motivante ya que te enseñan demasiado para ir superando te
good,"Great place to be employed at!  Standard office work, and it's a work environment in which there is room for advancement.  I miss my coworkers, and I miss working at Rent-A-Center!"
good,Take care of route with your accounts to make sure customers payments are on schedule for a payment. While working here your burn a lot of calories and you stay in good shape.
good,Job can be fun and enjoyable. Stressful at times when low on staff but very easy to get along with customers. Computer network easy to follow. Most staff is very friendly.
good,"Good pay, good manager, great support from corporate office, sufficient advertising, fun atmosphere,  great benefits,  advancement opportunities available"
good,Rent-A-Center is a excellent place to work. Rent-A-Center has been good to me it provided stability for my family. And they definitely give you the opportunity to advance within the company I have no complaints about working at Rent-A-Center
good,"Operations Manager"
good,"A normal day here would include items such as ensuring the cleanliness of the floor room, refurbishing used appliances, electronics, and furniture to be sold again, managing a significant amount of customers on your caseload, and finally making deliveries daily."
good,Performance based job  but you can advance quickly if you want to work the system. The atmosphere can be stressful at times trying to hit numbers but you also can be rewarded with prizes and money.
good,"Great job overall. I missed working for the company, if I wasn't going to school I would have stayed on the job working as a delivery driver. The manager I had while I was working there was the best manager I had out of any other job I worked at."
good,A typical day at work would be clocking in on time and looking over the schedule of deliveries which must be completed that day. The merchandise would be delivered and set up in the customers house and the next delivery would begin as soon as the set up is done.
good,"I had no issues with working there. I just could no longer work the hours I was assigned."
good,"Very demanding job, high pressure sales culture. Always a constant changes with new sales programs. Very competitive work environment. Lots of demands in short periods of time"
good,Other than pay and benefits just was not a good place for me. too many hours and stressful situations. No work life balance.
good,Loved my time at rent a center became great friends with a lot of people its especially nice if you work in the city you live because you meet new friends and reconnect with old ones as they come in as customers
good,Rent a center is a home furnishings rent to own company. They offer a wide variety of merchandise from computers to sofas. The base of the job is to sell items and collect the rent on those items.
good,Met many different people. Had some good and bad days at this job but got through it. There was great leadership. Made a lot of phone calls
good,Respectful people. Customer service is key. Coworkers are very nice and open. Proud to once be a member of this amazing company
good,"Usually came in around 9AM called about 150+ customers to either give them reminders of their payments or attempt to contact those that were already past due. Usually finishing calls around 11pm, we would take lunch for an hour. After that if we were short a delivery driver one of the CAR's (customer account representative) would go out on deliveries and pick ups, depending on how busy the store is at that time the other CAR would take the other vehicle and ""run"" any accounts that were 3+ days past due which consisted of driving to their houses and knocking on their door to get in contact with them to either collect payment or collect the merchandise. the day usually concluded with cleaning and resetting the show floor ending the day around 7PM-8PM."
good,A solid place to work you will advance if you are willing to put in the time and energy. Not for those looking to coast through the day. The work is hard but the environment is pleasant.
good,"I would prepare the day for deliveries and load the truck. deliver the merchandise to the customer and when I was not delivering merchandise I did some un loading truck, taking payments from customer, clean merchandise. I learned how some part of the busssiness was ran from scheduling, to priceing the merchandise for rentaling. The managment there was great they had a freindly, understanding, fun loving addittute, as well as the co workers. the hardest part about the job was the weather. Working in the rain or on a really hot day, even in the winter cold sometimes took its toll. the enjoyable parts were the driving to different citys and meeting new people."
good,this a job that makes you appreciate the little things in life especially if you are a parent because this job requires you to supervise and oversee youth wards of the state
good,"Working for Rent a center will expand your knowledge in rent to own business and allow you to aqcuaire many skills in the field of sales growth, collections, financial reports, and report trackers for areas of improvement.  I have learned how to manage a business for a 4 billion dollar company and increase profits by 10000.00 in the first 2 months and have learned how to cross train employees and look for areas of improvement.  The most enjoyiable part of the job is to see yourself succeed and your team and reach your goals every time.  The hardest part of the job would be to learn the process because communication is the key and you need to learn how to read people in order to navigate were you need to take the conversation."
good,Worked there part time met great people worked front desk. Work load is good just sometimes overwhelming. Phones constantly ringing and customers constantly coming in.
good,I am very micromanaged but am able to think outside the box with some of my events that we run.I have a staff of five right now and am looking for an account manager to hire to handle all accounts. The hardest part of the job is having to pick up customers merchandise and being the one to make that final decision to do so.
good,"making calls taking payments selling mmerchandise, helping customers find exactly what they need for their house. delivery washer and dryers and doing at home set up."
good,"During a typical day at work we open the store and work all the past due customers we stage all of the deliveries for the day and work sales calls and follow up with one last credit work at the end of the day.   Rent A Center has taught me more about customer service, sales, marketing and collections than my schooling ever did I believe a successful Rent A Center employee can make it in most any job.  Not all management's the same but the upper level management in our area is very fair and understanding and makes the daily grind much more enjoyable.  The hardest part of the job is the customers who dodge us and avoid us when they run past due and the over the top expectations they put on their staffing.  The best part of the job is the great customer relationships we get to develop being we see our customers weekly."
good,Very fast pace atmosphere where every day is different. Monthly training on changing sales and how to work with public. Great potential for advancement.
good,I loved rent a center but within a company I want to be able to move up in the company. The company is very good but I just didnt like the lack of team work. No one wanted to teach ever one was for there self but a guy like me like a team effort. i had to do whats best for my family
good,A typical day at work was tiring.  I learned to service electronics and do basic carpentry. I also learned how to manage customer accounts.
good,"There is lots of ways to advance at Rent A Center, and I enjoy working here but the hours are long and I am looking for higher pay now that I will be graduating college this year."
good,"During my time as an assitant manager for this company I averaged at least 55 hours during a single work week. The company takes care of the employees as far as pay and benefits and is flexible during time off for family emergencies, health issues, ect, but they also do not allow any time for someone to have the ability to spend time with their own family."
good,The Rent A Center company has the best training and development program for career advancement.  The company generally promotes from within and gives the Rent A Center Family the opportunity to improve employee livelihood.  The RTO business is a very challenging business and competitive people excel in this organization.
good,"Multitasking job at times"
good,"A fast pace job that keeps you sharp.a fun place to work at.i work with a great crew.daily challenges,constant problem solving"
good,Its a fun job if you are working with the right people. The hours are a bit demanding. its not easy to get promoted but job security is good.
good,"I would work about 10 hours a day delivering, selling and picking up customers, I learned that its hard to do the necessary job, like pick up customers that are past due. The management was great there, we all worked together well. Coworkers were great as well they would do anything you would ask of them. The hardest part about my job is the part of picking up some kids beds that were past due. The most enjoyable part was letting them keep if at all possible."
good,a lot of hours!!this is not a family oriented job. If you got kids but dont have a baby sitter this job is not for you. Its better if you have older children but if you have younger children its hard to manage both jobs!
good,"I would have to move furniture most of the day because I did not do sales, I would some times have to deal with rude people, and maintain credit, Meaning if the customer did not pay I would have to hunt him down by knocking at his residence or calling him and living door hangers at his home."
good,"Facilitate training to 23 COE (Center of Excellence) store managers and store personnel. Conduct monthly visits to the COE stores to calibrate training across the organization. The program includes hands on instruction, verbal presentation, informational literature, and audio/visual aids. This position also includes serving as an Operations Liaison to Shared Services by collaborating on the development of training materials in conformance with selected delivery methods."
good,"Ensure successful sales transactions through friendly and enthusiastic customer service skills. Train, motivate and evaluate co-workers"
good,Be prepared to work and work hard. Hours can be long and the work can difficult. I always felt the pay was fair and that the job was rewarding.
good,A typical day at Rent A Center is opening the store at 9am everyday except Sundays. Turning on all the electronics and going over scheduled workload and deliveries for the day. I learned to work effectively in a fast paced environment. My manager was a good teacher when I needed help. My co-workers were great to work with being tho we were together everyday and teamwork was required every time to accomplish most tasks. The hardest part of the job is moving furniture in some customers houses where the hallways & doors were narrow. The most enjoyable part of the job was being on the road from one delivery to the next under no supervision but the trust to get the job done expiditiously.
good,"Es una empresa de constante crecimiento, y donde se puede describir como un semillero ya que crea futuros jefes, adoptando la idea de que un trabajador contento trabaja mejor, mas sin embargo consume demaciado tiempo y esto evita tener una calidad de vida buena o excelente."
good,"A typical days involves sales calls, collection calls, sales, collections in store or in the field, restocking show room, taking payments and assisting in management duties. "
good,"long days, not enough recognition. management need more training."
good,"As a Manager at the store had a lot of responsibility."
good,this place is overall nice and enjoyable management and co-workers (some of them) but it is ALOT OF PHYSICAL work. and work a minimum of 50 hours a week and work all day on saturday but other than that its nice.
good,Customer Service is the best part of the job. I work alot with hispanic customers.
good,"I love my ability to develop great customer relationships."
good,"I was a member of their organization for 15 years, starting from the bottom and working my way up. The company has great vision and an even better business model. It is a company that changes peoples lives...both of coworkers and customers. "
good,It is a good place to work.  Fairly easy place to work at.  You do not get much time with your family unless you go to bed late and everyone else in your family does as well.
good,"print and review all reports from previous business day, open store by assuring products are rent ready and showroom is clean and inviting. all sales tags are properly displayed."
good,a nice place to work with no complaints on the upper management
good,"This was a tough job, considering the area, but overall good experience."
good,"A typical work day for an account manager includes, calling past due and due today accounts, running routes (visiting customers houses), collecting money and or merchandise, selling, and deliveries."
good,"a typical day at work"
good,Worked with and met a lot of great people. Helped customers with new furniture and appliances on an affordable weekly payment plan.
good,"Typical day involves making many calls to both past due customers, as well as today's due customers to remind them of upcoming payments and updating info into the main system. delivery and collections go on throughout the day. Daily sales quotas must be met as well as weekly quotas. marketing calls and refurbishment of merchandise is also done when time allows. day typically runs from 10- 12 hours."
good,"A typical day for me begins at 8am and ends at 9pm Mon-Sat."
good,"A decent day of work, physically demanding, and relatively long hours, but good work environment."
good,"all my co-workers were great, really busy place didn't really see management they were only there about one a month. got to meet a lot of new people."
good,It was a good position. I really enjoyed it. Split days off but my district manager personally trained me to be an assistant manager.
good,"A typical day at work consists of reviewing the previous work day's transactions to analyze for any improvements. Organize offices and get the store ready for hours of operation, greet customers in store and over the phone while encouraging customers to buy merchandise with offering sales and promotions. Manage customers' accounts and create accounts for new customers and review necessary paperwork and work history to approve or deny merchandise rentals. Contact customers over the phone to receive form of payment and schedule a pick up time to collect merchandise that could not be paid for. Create a daily schedule for employees and follow up to make sure goals are being satisfied. Keep track of inventory and place orders for merchandise and office supplies. Management helps guide the store with monitoring transactions and profits to make sure monthly goals are met along with making sure employees are satisfied. Being at a business like Rent A Center has taught me how to deal with many challenging situations while keeping a smooth running store and team. Its been very beneficial to see the ins and outs of how to manage a business. Co-workers are a great asset to the team and as managers it is key to keep them on schedule and communicate to create a healthy work environment. The hardest part of the job is having to collect merchandise on customers who especially need it but cannot afford it and the most enjoyable part of the job is to be able to sell merchandise to customers that are in need of it and keeping them satisfied."
good,Management is fair with employees. Fun work environment with customers and co-workers.
good,"I have worked for this company for over three years and I have truly enjoyed my experience here as each day creates new opportunites to push myself just a little bit harder, to be better than I was yesterday...a typical day at this company consists of a LOT of phone calls, attempting to collect past due payments while assisting new/potential customers, signing them up for the program or simply providing them with information about the program...I have learned to think quickly to resolve issues, to act with a servant's heart and to be accountable for my decisions and actions...each store is, in essence, it's own entity, having usually no more than three people at any one location, but through the vast number of stores alone, regardless of distance or region, Rent-A-Center is a family unto itself...you literally spend more time at work than you do at home, but this creates the family dynamic/mentality of the typical Rent-A-Center associate...we are generally there for one another...this, and the never-ending opportunity to assist customers are the BEST part of my job at Rent-A-Center"
good,"the people you work with are awesome and customers are even better. I learned a lot about revenues and profit and losses depreciation of items (product), how to solve problems with training a developing anyone needing help, making sure everyone was on the path of success and promotion. rent a center is a good company to work for just the hours are long 12 hour shifts a day and certain management would micro manage you where you couldn't be your own boss sometimes but that is all on who you district manager or regional directors is at the time of employment. being away from your family is the hardest but the best thing would have to be the customers because just one conversation would get their spirits up and putting a smile on someone's face when their day isn't going so well is the best part."
good,This job was great in pay but the hours where extremely long and no time off.
good,You work constantly with customer through the good times and the bad times while trying to maintain a business approach no matter how difficult that might be.  Been through the best of times and the worst of times with the company. Upper management seem to forget what actually happens in the store level.

I learned ways to handle customer service issues and also how to be a better salesman. Management is mostly new since the turnover rate is high among managers. One will meet great co-workers here. The hardest part of the job is having a life outside of work. there is a mandatory 48 hours per week for entry level and 50 hours a week for the supervisor positions. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting your coworkers.

He handled every situation with an incredible calm about him. He had an extremely smooth way of getting the situation to come around to his way of thinking.

good,"Worked as a customer account rep (entry level position) for one and a half years. Did business with a huge variety (from fairly rich to poverty) of people, and got to travel around the towns. Learned a great deal about successful sales approach, and developed a goal-oriented attitude. The toughest part of the job is/was dealing with difficult financial situations. The most enjoyable part of the job was the ridiculous amount of variety you could have in a single day. You could spend all day working with difficult customers, driving to accomplish deliveries, and having countless interesting encounters. Management was very fair and made for a fun, productive atmosphere. Co-workers were always there to help, and had the mindset to accomplish the daily tasks."
good,Hertz was a great place to work right out of college they gave me an opportunity and allowed me to grow. Plenty of room for advancement and even more if you are willing to relocate. I only wish I did not have to leave the company upon moving.

good,"Rent-A-Center is a great place to work and they company really encouraged training and advancement opportunities, but unfortunately my manager really made our jobs difficult. He was a great guy himself but had tendencies to over burden our delivery planner with way too many deliveries and made collection percentages difficult to obtain by re-renting to difficult accounts. With those two factors in mind, it made it really easy to get burnt out, bored and frustrated with the job. Other store managers in our district definitely seemed more reasonable and easier to work for but unfortunately my store manager was not. If things were different manager-wise I might not ever leave but I find it better for myself to pursue new career opportunities."

good,I worked really long hours. The pay was pretty good and I advanced myself pretty quick I was the asst. manager within 6 months. Also enrolled in the management training program to run my own store.
good,"Is a great place to work. Is just take a long time to advance you only advance if some one quite or get fired. I have learned a lot working their about sales and credit . Working with all types of customer with different atitudes, you learn to deal with each and every one in a professional manner.My manager is great he supports and understands and has been there to speak up for me in any situation great team.

good,Plan the day with the team on sales goal and objectives for the day. I've learned how to coach and develop team members to be ready for future advancements. I've learned to manage my team by coaching and training but having fun through out the day. My coworkers feel like I am there to help them. I can't say there is a hard part of the job. The key is to be consistent with all aspects of managing the store. The most enjoyable is working with a strong team that wants to make it happen for you and the branch. And after achieving that the whole store get recognized.
good,"Llegas revisas tus reportes para sacar tus metas diarias, delegas actividades y vas midiendo resultados para llegar a tu meta semanal  y mensual tanto de ventas como de cobranza."
good,"I enjoyed working here, the in-store management was great, upper management left somewhat of a bad taste in my mouth though. I witnessed the manager for my district celebrate because she finally had an excuse to fire someone she didn't like. This made me, as a new employee, feel like I was walking on eggshells constantly. I was worried for my job occasionally if there were concerns over my productivity, which there were no company standards for but rather spoken ones from management. Other than that it was actually very enjoyable. My co-workers were awesome and we had a great time there. It was less a ""job"" and more a fun place to hang out all day, even though we worked hard more often than we didn't. One of the duties was moving furniture into customers homes and I ruptured 3 discs catching a couch that was falling onto a coworker. After them forcing me to take a medical leave of absence even though I was on workers comp the entire time, I was laid off after the required amount of time for a medical LOA had passed. This left me less than impressed but I was told that it was the district manager (again) who had done this. I would absolutely work for the company again, just in a different area so I did not have to deal with this specific manager."
good,"Always something do, on the phone, with a customer, or on a delivery. The only problem is the schedule"
good,Great working environment. Great crew in all the stores that I worked with. District Manager was very helpful in assisting me with my promotions. But when I left my district that's where my downfall was met. Got to have the patience to deal with some ignorant people. But great benefits and a great team will overcome that situation.
good,"My typical day at RAC was usually long and very challenging.  As store manager I was responsible for everything that happened there each day.  I learned how to manage people in different ways and that with this particular job, most of the decisions that I made had some kind of impact in someone's life.  Most of my co-workers were very goal oriented and success driven which I believe made everyone else accountable for their own performance.  The most difficult part of the job was the fact that you are trying to collect money from people who don't have money and the fact that many of these customers have made poor financial choices throughout their lives that lead them to be your customer in the first place.  The best part of the job was being able to provide a product or service to someone who without your business wouldn't be able to have and enjoy that product.  Also, I enjoyed teaching them the proper financial discipline so that they were able to keep that merchandise until it was paid off"
good,"I love to always do some productive work so that it helps the company grow with nice and fun working environment."
good,"I started as an account manager delivering merchandise, handling past due accounts and working with customers. I learned how to handle upset customers provide a solution and resolve their issues in a timely manner. The managers I worked for were all their to help and guide you to be a better employee. they are understanding honest and very appreciative of your hard work. the hardest thing I ha to was deliver merchandise to some really tight places. you have to be able to make good decisions and follow through. the most rewarding part was to put a smile on a customers face after you just delivered the product and showed them how to work the item. the money was also great. you got a steady raise on a frequent basis."
good,enjoyed meeting lots of different people and assisting as needed

Customers were rude at times but the fun part of the day was competing with other stores when we had sales contest for the week. love the competition.

good,Each day brought upon a different challange that I eagerly awaited to tackle as company goals were expected to be obtained on a daily basis. I learned a great deal in multitasking as well as problem solving abilities as each customer brought upon a potential different issue which required immediate action to keep them satisfied. Developing and training co-workers was an ongoing process while in management and it felt good to get those implemented in the day to day operations while also motivating and driving them to a higher level of commitment to not only maintain but surpass company/personal goals that had been set. The hardest part of the job may was that rent to own is a highly risky business in which we have limit resources in assuring our product will be properly paid on are taking care of while in the customer possesion. Communication was key with my customers in that we maintain a good relationship in the event financial hardships would arrive in their lives they would feel the need to contact us to avoid potentially diminshing the business relationship we had created.

good,"Rent A Center is a very complex yet simple company. If you have the capacity to surpass all sales quotas, meet and exceed the physical requirements of the position (male or female) and enjoy servicing clients then this could definitely be your match made in heaven. Working for Rent A Center taught me so much and it pushed me beyond my wildest dreams. I enjoyed my supervisors and coworkers at my original location tremendously! We worked as a team and always got the job done with quality being our first goal. My transfer store was a little different; the morale was not as high and there a few  issues with credit. As the only female in the store I never asked for special treatment and always put my best foot forward. Resolving delinquent accounts or ""running credit"" can be exciting yet dangerous. Overall management and my coworkers played an intricate part in the person I've become. Expect to work long hours, clean merchandise, unload trucks, maintain the showroom, manage inventory, conduct meetings and sale, sale sale!!!"

As a new store manager I was really left on my own. Company policy is that new store managers have guidance in their first six months, this plan is executed by the dm. This was not my experience however. After months of trying to fix things in a store that was failing when i got there, i decided i couldn't handle the stress and abhorrent hours i was working each week.

It was fun to work for the biggest store in Georgia we had a lot of furniture that would be rented out to customers appliances and electronics ..... But the hard part about working for the biggest store in Georgia is where you have to be cold hearted when it comes to collecting a payment or collecting a rent payment if they still want to keep the item sometimes you have to be hard on the customer sometimes they don't want to pay up so they might pull a gun out on you which you have to beg down get back in the truck call the police till then you can't leave the property until either you get a payment or you get the property back that would be the hard part about working for Rent-A-Center

good,I learned several new features and ways to enhance my work ethic at Rent-A-Center. There was much to learn and a variety of people to build from as well as with.
good,"The weekly pay was a definite incentive for working with Rent A Center. However, upper management sometimes abused their power by taking 4 hour long breaks to handle personal affairs and expected store staff to cover for them in the event a higher ranking official came asking questions of their whereabouts.However, they were equally quick to throw a fellow employee under the bus had the tables been turned. Not cool. Aside from that, nice place to work."
good,"Working here has been great, but I want to explore more options and see where what I have learned working here, can take me. "

Which is something very important for every manager to plan their day to have a successful day at work. And that is one of the things i learn from this job, that organization is very important. I also learned to listen to your employees for feedback and be a bit more open to listening to what they might want to add. In general I gained a lot of new management skills that before i didn't know of or wasn't aware of and now I will take them with me, as well as the labor work I had to perform and to be a team player with your employees, because at the end of the day we are a team. As a manager, I also learned to handle difficult situations not just with customers but with employees as well. But overall the cultural at Rent A Center is very diverse due to the task we all had to perform even me as a manager. And that is what I enjoyed the most from this job that for the most part I was in the store. But others I had to be out in the field with my employees, which I really enjoyed as I could take the time to train them out in the field. And the hardest part of this job doesn't have to do much with the job performance but more with the schedule as it was a very crazy schedule and took most of our day and didn't give us much time to do our personal errands. so we had to take advantage of our days off."
good,"Its never the same 2 days in a row, you deal with alot of customers and always find a way on how they can pay on their items or hold it for them. Sales deliveries and pick ups keep you busy. You are also on the phone a lot of the time."
good,"Wide variety of opportunities and advancements. No two days are the same,which makes it very exciting and fulfilling. A great learning experience in business and in life."
good,"A typical day at Rent a Center would consist of you riding around to various locations making deliveries. My management team always gave me the necessary tools to succeed. Hardest part about the job would be weather, some days required you to be wet. The most enjoyable part would be how fast time would go by being that you're constantly moving."

good,"Except for saturdays, I got to call people to remind them to pay their bills, then spent about half an hour putting things on a truck to deliver. That was half the day. Then all the same in reverse. I unloaded the truck and called everyone else to pay their bills. This was a day. I learned how to construct and maintain furniture and appliances as well as Jackson county. The store I was at the longest the manager was great. The store I was sent to the team was a rude and overbearing. That was the hardest part outside of ""square pegs through round holes"" where customers wanted funiture but misguessed the size of their space. The best part was discovering new customers at new locations and the driver/assistant partnership."
good,We achieve are goals by getting things done threw others. We prioritize our goals daily weekly monthly.customer service is first impression. We make rent a center at home.

good,"Normally a typical day consist of having a morning meeting see where we stand for the week on our sales and credit numbers. Find out about everyones morning has been going thus far, but the hardest part would be after a long day at work and the rapport that you have with your employees you must leave that well bonded team.

good,Collected outstanding balances from domestic and international customer's.
good,"A typical day consisted of calling late or missing payments, driving out deliveries, repo, and then file management and storeroom maintenance. I was the Sales Manager, so I was in charge of managing client files, cold-calling, salesroom maintenance and shuffling, and price-change. I won awards for having the highest sales/lowest credit in the region for 6 months straight. I also did purchase orders, and help special ""Guest-only"" sales and dinners. I had a great team to work with; we were a very well oiled machine. After a year there, we didn't even need to question our jobs, we knew by the look of one another, what we were needing to get done, and we did it. The hardest part of the job was getting on the truck to do repo. It could get a little dangerous at times."
good,Working at rent a center was great i just moved that was the reason why i had to leave the company. The management was very nice and very professional when it came down to work.
good,"I enjoyed it thoroughly. This company taught me everything I know today and has helped me become the manager I am. They put me through extensive management training after I proved myself ready.

My workday consists of gathering the days orders and budget information together and processing claims and scheduling delivery of clients merchandise. "
good,"training they give is helpful, i learned alot about collections and different ways to handle situations based on experience, management is great, company has incentive bonuses all the time, hardest part of the job is probably the different challenges you will face inside a customers house when delivering merch."
good,Manager just pull me on the floor with no training with signing contracts. Therefore I was not comfortable in talking with the customer by sales because I didn't want to tell lies
good,I would say this job is definitely for people who love to sell merchandise you have to continuously get sales and you have to maintain an extremely low credit it’s hard to maintain that when most of your customers don’t pay on top but the trick of the job is to get the customers to pay on time so my advice is for people that want to work at Rent A Center you have to know how to sell merchandise and alsoGet the customer to pay on time

I believe that all members of upper management should be require to work EVERY POSITION from a store level Customer Service Rep on up, to qualify for such upper management positions...."
good,It’s ok. I been working there for a year and some time so I’m getting better at what I do. Just my hours are from morning to night. Seems like long hours sometimes.
good,"During the time I was there I really enjoyed working for the company. The only issue with the company was not being able too advance as quickly through the company. The benefits are great and also free lunches that were earned throughout the week. Overall a good company to work for but you are required to work overtime, working 48-52 hours per week. So, if you have a family that requires your attention, this company would not be good for you."
good,handle deliverys for costumers repoing merchandise and fixing damage merchandise
good,It was a great and fun to work for this employer.Only thing is hard with the hours as a manager with a family at home.

Apprenticeship programs I have sought after due to the fact you can go to school and not be burdened by student loans after."
good,Overall this is a great company to work for.  Yes it has a high stress level involved.  However if you can stomach that you are good to go.  It is a good place to work.
good,"A typical day consists of delivery of items to local residents. By far the best part of the job is meeting new people we deliver to. My coworkers are some outstanding guys. Unfortunately that can not be said about the management or better yet, lack there of."
good,"No comment, Working for this company will take away all of your time. It will keep you away from family and accumilate alot of stress and depression. So much happens in this job that top management lets go and even they break policy. Rent A Center will drain you out completely and if you allow the racism and the gossip and dont snitch you will get fired just like me. But you know what im very happy now that im not there and have to deal with a company in which i dont understand how is still in business with it having a low turnover rate employee wise why because of what goes on in this company."
good,"Great place to work,only problem is the time work over 50 hours a week with only 1 day off, not enough time to spend with the family"
good,"Calling late or currently due payments, driving out deliveries, and then file management and storeroom maintenance."

The hardest part of the job I would have to say was picking up furniture or appliances from customers that were past due on accounts. I enjoyed interacting with customers and assisting them with providing them great customer service.

good,"Responsibilities included: management of over 200 accounts, personalized customer service"
good,"Typical day at work was managing coworkers to hit very specific goals to keep us in the top of the region. I learned how to properly motivate different people in different ways, and apply different management techniques to different people individually. Management was where the problem came into play as my Regional Director became a little to involved in my personal life causing me to ultimately leave the company. My coworkers were faithful and loyal hard-working people that would've done anything to help us win. The hardest part of the job was holding people you've grown to know over all the time together accountable for poor performance. The most enjoyable part was just the camaraderie among the coworkers at each management level and dealing with the customers -- helping people."
good,"A typical day at my previous job, was interviewing complainants and solving problems in anyway possible."
good,Was great to meet new people and to help with any of thier needs.

Most of my co-workers were cool. I did develop a large customer base over the years that i was there. Unfortunately it was lack of advancement after all the hard work and proving myself that led to me leaving.

good,"Very hard work, I did collections, deliveries, sales. manager was awesome to work for,hard work but fun enviroment."

good,Nice job but a lot of hours. I need more time at home with my family.
good,lots of hands on with the customers learned how to deal with issues that customers had
good,You had to make sure you was on top of your game and do enventory and pick up late clients.
good,This company is a great company to work for but for me I need something knew to expand my opportunities. There has been to many changes in the last months. I really love this job but with knew owners who are bringing in there friends from there otther company its like favoritism is being showed. I just want a chance to work learn something knew a progress into to a leader of a great company. I've been working here for 5 yrs and its time for me to get a better opportunity
good,great opportunities for advancement - need to be familiar with accounting and qualifying people for rental services - must be able to move furniture and appliances on a day to day basis
good,Great place to work they are really good at arranging things for you no matter the circumstance. Management actually cared and for pay it wasn't to bad.
good,I loved working for rent a center. it was fun for me fixing things and cleaning the appliances. I like to work hard. but I don't feel it paid enough was more like a $14 or more an hour place. and I didn't even live in a place where 2 stories existed often. if I lived in a busy city I think would have to be $16 or more an hour.
good,"The place was good to work at the company is amazing, their values are good, the management at the store level could use some help. In my Experience the store manager I had cared only about her advancement and not her employees. I feel she will drag this store into the gutter fast!"
good,"It seemed that people came and went. You no more than get one person trained and they'd quit. The environment was harsh, the management was rude and heartless, and many were cut throat."
good,"Overall a god place to work in, great coworkers, nice benefits in the long run, opportunities for advancement if you want them. May need more training"
good,I loved the company Rent a Center as a child. I was hired on the spot as an account manager. Shortly I realized management was poor and everything that was labor related was left on my hands. I found it unfair and I left.
good,I got to travel to places I never heard of and met new people.Have fun with the staff and customers .Got to travel to different communities.Hours varies on how the company progress.
good,"The days were pretty relaxed and steady paced, some days would he a little more hecktic but they would never schedule more than what they though we could handle"
good,They are a great company to work for. The company provides many oppurtunities to grow. They also allow you take benifit from raises twice a year as well as a weeks vacation.
good,great place to work if you're looking for something that will keep you busy .Most of the time youre out collecting over due payments from customers who are passed due.
good,never a boring day dealing with the public and each  each day is always a challenge but with a great staff and great support from management everyday is a success
good,"Fun, exciting and good paying job but lack of time at home. Many different things to do which can become overwhelming. Deliveries, pick ups, collections, sales, telemarketing, general upkeep, etc."
good,It was a very physically demanding job. I worked 50 hours a week so I did not get to spend much time with my family. I enjoyed the competitive sales aspect and the collections aspects most.
good,"A typical day with rent-a-center included making calls to all past due accounts and setting up a payment or a pick-up of the merchandise, meeting daily credit standards, ensuring bank deposits were made before 11 am, getting reporst from host store showing all credit denials and reaching out to them to generate a sale, making calls to all paid off accounts to generate sales, ensuring all files were up to date. I had the opportunity to work with some of the best people with this company, upper management was amazing and always a phone call away. The hardest part of this job was keeping up with both credit and sales standards on a monthly basis. The most enjoyable part of this job was working with the customers to better their quality of life with their furniture purchase."
good,"Customers were excellent to be around, actually leaving store to do a run was rewarding, meeting new people everyday, fast paced, great manager, good pay"
good,RAC is hands down a class business. If your good at what you do you will do great at RAC and get promoted quickly. IF your willing to learn then your in.
good,I love working for the company. You do have opportunity to advance in the company and your fellow employees become your second family because you work together so much. I loved working for the company until I started working with my current manager. Been with the company for 5 years now
good,"would load truck as in order of stops,keep required records,inspect vehicle,interact with store personnel,observe laws of the road,unload items for repair by area,usually one overnight run per week."
good,Typical work day consists of comeing  in checking  credit morning meetings and insite on plan to get customers  in. I learnd how to approach  different  customers  in different  situations to get best out come hardest  part is doing  repos of merchandise but the the best part is gettn sale and making cuse happy  with the things they buy and they needd
good,was an ok place to work very physical and long days the only down side was a lack of employee managers were great to work with but really demanded a lot and never willing to help you out.
good,"Rent A Center is a doubled edged sword. They expect you to sell, sell, sell, but then require you to collect. This becomes the double edged sword when you have to meet a sales and collection quota. Sales will make bad decisions in order to meet the quota and then collections is left holding the bag."
good,"the companies turn overrate was high, hiring parties hardly explain the long hours, the work schedules where not explained on how late time can run the days off"
good,it high stress and depending on which city you live in can be some what dangerous. the benefits and paid holidays are awesome. could be an awesome job with the right management staff
good,"worked for them for 8 years most of which was great. it wasnt up until the last years i had a problem. the regional manager hired a friend who just went overboard on everything which resulted in my succeeding store to start failing because ""my way"" was wrong and they decided to change how i was succeeding. this ended in me being proved right and me walking due to differences with management."
good,this job is very fun and dealing with customers each day brings new things to the table and it allows me to see other ways to deal with different situations.
good,To start the day I write out a step by step guide on what needs to be done that day so when my team comes in they are ready to get started and they can see what has to be done by the end of that day. next I review my paper work from the day before ti insure my team takes proper payments and rental agreements. I then do mostly follow ups with my crew and make sure the store is running properly.
good,Great work environment and fun people to work with. Something different happens daily and makes the job fun with great incentives.
good,good job nice place to start a career good learning experience
good,It was long hours but the pay made it worth the time away. Working for Rent A Center was by far one of my most memorable and enjoyable jobs.

good,"Definitely would say that you will learn a lot and very strong communication skill and how defuse mild to high verbal situations. went into this job with zero experience and was in line for a store manger position. hardest part of the job I would say is collections but that alone speaks for itself. there is weekly and monthly contest gift cards, store lunches or outings, game tickets and trophies and self rewarding what you can accomplish as team and individual"
good,"Una de las mejores empresas en las que eh laborado, me dejo demasiadas enseñanzas."
good,"My boss was one of the best bosses you could get. He taught me a lot and gave me positive encouragement on a regular basis. The job it's self could be both relaxed and stressful. I actually enjoyed this job and working for AJ Boswell tremendously. I left for personal family affairs.  IF I had been without children, at that time. I believe I would still be on the job, and would have moved up in the company. Which,they do make very accessible to you. However being a single mother duty belongs to family first. This is no longer a burden I carry I am currently single with no children to tend, they live with there father."

good,"Great employes and a good stable company to work for. Understanding company values and rules is a must, not a bad company."
good,"I gained  a wealth of knowledge about business, customer service, and great leadership here.  Unfortunately, the work life balance was not so great!  12-14 hour days 6 days a week for 4 years can really wear you down.

good,I love working with new people and doing new things everyday. Rent A Center was the place to be! Plenty of hours to work and great pay and the customers where excellent too.
good,As an assistant manager the job is very demanding. I am the sales leader and the goal for me is to drive customers into the store in order to grow the business' customer base. Telemarketing is a big portion of this also delegate tasks to co-workers and follow up that they are getting completed. Deliver merchandise to people's homes on occasions and also run the ordering of parts and service for the customers. Hardest part of the job is dealing with the stress of getting people into the store in order to sell them merchandise. Working the long hours of 50 hrs a week is also one of the toughest parts of the job.
good,The atmosphere was amazing I was able to sharpen my customer service skills. My manager was there to assist with  any questions not only from me but the customer . The other employees just as great.

Management in a performance based company tends to have a high turn over rate. Store culture is fun, productive and becomes like a family environment. The 100 degree heat is not fun, but our customers and co-workers make it worth it."

good,"Over all a great place to work, if you dont like to make plans and you dont have children. This isn't a job I would recommend for people with young Children. This job takes alot of dedication, time, strength, loyalty. Being a small team of 5 you dont have anyone to cover for you if you call in sick. This job is very rewarding, the experience is somehing I will take with me everywhere I go, i had a great management team and if it wasnt for my boss i never would have had the chance to experience what I did.

good,A typical day is always educational and management is welling to help you with whatever you need. The hardest part of the job is mainly dealing with customers that want to curse at you but you stay professional and deal with it.
good,tiene pros¿cesos muy establecidos pero desconocidos en la cultura comercial de la comunidad por ser un concepto de renta con opcion a lcompra y eso hace que se requiera mucha dedicacion en el amnejo de la operacion
good,long days. I learned hard work pays. Management was fine. Helped with growth of employees. friendly work culture.  Hardest part would be heavy items to deliver. Good staff made for a great day.
good,I enjoyed my job and it kept me in shape but its no place for a person who has a family or is in school or anything because you work long hours and its a lot of lifting.
good,"I really liked this job, it was a lot of work, but the potential to advance within the company and make a decent living, with no collage degree and no previous experience.  I got fired for getting a DUI (off the clock)"
good,"This job is not for everybody, but I loved it. it is a performance based promotion environment which means that the only thing that will hold you back at this job is you."
good,"I worked at RAC for about 3 years...starting at the very bottom. At first I thought it was going to be hard getting use to the computer, the customers, the everyday life of working retail. Couple months went by and I found myself LOVING what I was doing. The manager and the staff were GREAT, AWESOME!!!! We were all family. And that's how it is today Friday, September 9, 2016. If one of you were down the rest of the team was there to get you in that spot were you needed to be to get you back in the game. The manager there knows her stuff! Easy DM material!!! All I can say is do your job, make sure your head is right, and love what you do. If your lazy, this job isn't for you. If your cocky, arrogant, and think you deserve the world, this job isn't for you. The people on this site that are ""former employees"" making bad remarks probably either got fired because of the above characteristics, or worked there for two weeks and couldn't handle a job that didn't allow you to get high everyday or drink every night and come into work. No, the people here, customers and staff are very down to Earth people that just want somebody to do what's right. Whether it is working for the company, or making a great sale to better that customers life. Be serious if you are putting an application in at this place. If you plan on being there for a long time, like what you do, and can handle a job that requires you to act like a frickin human being, then go for it. If you plan on being a joke, and have attendance issues or you think eh, it's a paycheck, then stay home and don't waste the managers time."
good,"I loved working in rent to own, it was fun rewarding job to make customers understand that due dates and payments were needed on time. It was stressfull sometimes when customers refused to allow you to do your job."
good,I truly  loved Rent A Center. It taught  and groomed me into a positive person. It never put any limitation on my growth and allowed me to reach for the stars
good,"Empresa Americana con una cultura de enseñanza, excelente ambiente de trabajo en oficina,"
good,"My typical day when I was the assistant manager was sat, mon, wed and fri 9-7/ 9-5 thurs and and off sunday and Tuesday.  At this point our hours were 48 hours a week which pretty much gave no home time with the kids.  Then the company reworked the schedule and cut us to 40 hours a week.  I've learned a lot at this point with getting to know the company, collections and sales.  I think the hardest part of the job was being away from my children, getting home at 730 some nights 8 was hard on the kids.  I think that the most enjoyable part was being off for 5 holidays, customers and coworkers"
good,This was a great opportunity to show great customer skills while providing a quality work experience. The people I inspired also did the same for me.
good,Great place to work with good work life balance and dedication to the customer and employee experience.  Would recommend.

good,"Get to the store open all doors"
good,"My experience with this company has taught me a multitude of skills, lessons and responsibilities that I know for a fact I would not have learned elsewhere at a normal retail location. I had great teachers and have made great friends throughout the district I am located in. The opportunity is there for those of you who are looking for stability, and a long term goal in which to achieve. When I first started my first retail part time job I was also FT college and didn't know what I was getting myself into. I was not confident enough in myself to continue college with the field I was in so I began looking for a FT position somewhere and RAC was there for me to provide ample paychecks and a learning experience that I can guarantee you will take to other places."
good,"For almost 11 years now I have been able to work for a company that understands today's economy and the public's financial stress.  With affordable weekly or monthly payments, customer's now have the ability to enjoy the most up to date products without going into debt.  "
good,As an employee of RAC you are responsible for meeting sales and collections goals on a daily basis. Every one worked as a team player to reach their  goals in our division. Somedays was difficult when you had a lot of deliveries in a twelve hour day to make sure you always met your goals plus maintained office administrative duties. All of our management  support team made sure if we was out of the office that all the business criteria was met. The most rewarding part of the job was growing customer satisfaction. Sometimes customers are having problems with meeting their financial obligations and you  are able to work out a strategy plan to solve their dilemma.
good,lots of different things to do day to day the hardest part of the job is not getting a lot of time off
good,"Un dìa tìpico empezando con llamadas de cobranza checando la carpeta de posibles ventas en el dia organizando un a buena ruta para ventas de campo, repartir la ruta de los chicos de cobranza monitorear las visitas capturando en tiempo y forma la visita en el sistema y dejar un antecedente en el mismo. Tomar pagos y atender quejas y sugerencias de los clientes ya que la garantía de los productos es total responsabilidad de la empresa.

Entregar valores, armar paquetería de facturas a corporativo, acomodo de mercancía en piso de venta, lo mas difícil es mantener un ir a comprar los materiales para la limpieza ya que todos querían ir esto se programa cada mes, y lo que mas me gusto fue el reto de aprender a controlar una cartera sana ya que las ventas es lo mas sencillo de este trabajo."

good,"Typical day would be making calls to customer, servicing in store customers with rentals. Making deliveries of furniture or picking up furniture. managing inventory. My co-workers make it fun most days to come to work and makes the day go by fast. The hardest part of the job is tracking down customers for non payment for their lease"
good,"I would usually come into work, make a call through of everyone who was past due and try to get some commitments. After making calls, we would all focus on sales and trying to make the store look better. Thinking of ways to get people in was the best part because our ideas were always kind of fun. The only hard part about the job was lifting because I am not very big for my age. I enjoyed my time with my employees though, they always made me laugh."
good,"A typical day at Rent A Center consists of managing, training and developing 5 employees. The morning consist of daily financial paperwork profits and losses. Making collection calls and field visits to past due accounts. The afternoons generally consist of selling furniture and other merchandise, telemarketing calls and constant follow up with employees. Handeling customer concerns and problem solving. Verifying and qualifying customers for products."
good,"Open the store get showroom and back room ready."
good,"A typical day at work started out with a store meeting followed by getting the showroom ready for opening. Throughout the day I managed a crew of 4. Starting with scheduling efficiency and doing what I could to make their job as productive yet enjoyable as possible. I was a salesman, telemarketer, collector money handler. I managed money, inventory and a showroom. Management was always there if you needed assistance.  The hardest part of the job was that it is a rent to own company and to see the rough times customers sometimes went through, having to return their items and not being able to assist them as much as I would like to however with that said I was always able to do the job without letting emotions get in the way. The most enjoyable was that most of my customers became like another family and I always enjoyed being able to be another ear for them to vent to, share good times in their lives and bad."

good,I enjoyed my time at Rent-A-Center from learning how to be a better salesman to learning about the ins and outs of delivering goods. I also was able to learn from my coworker on different style of selling. I would say the most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with the customers on a daily basis. The hardest part of the job would be delivering to certain places. Some were safe and some were not.
good,"Working for Rent A Center was challenging, every day was different and with plenty of work. Benefits were great and advancement opportunities were great, they had a good foundation for their system."
good,"The company was an excellent and unexpected advancement for me in my customer care. I have learned to work with many different types of people of different cultures. From past success, is see that consistency is a must in collections or any job field for that matter."
good,the rent a center experience was a fun filled ride in my life we were all like a small family
good,You spend your day working with customers to meet there needs. When following company ethos and directives goals and standards are easy to meet. I learned that every account and every individual is different so you need an open mind when dealing with accounts. You need to be informed with every situation and quick on your feet. The hardest part of your job is collecting on past due accounts. These people become your friends and you need to treat them as such as you follow company procedures.
good,"Typical day of the Rent A Center would be come in during the morning hours, make your phone calls to collect all debt on delinquent accounts, Soon after check daily delivery sheet and prep deliveries as fast and accurately as possible. Later in the day return to office to collect on daily delinquent accounts."
good,great work place great people could have a higher wage but overall good place to be
good,Everday job process was collections and sales.
good,The job gave you plenty of work hours and had great management.
good,"Rent A Center is a great place to work for. Some of the Pros of working for them is the job security and advancement, accounts are opened everyday so you know there is always going to be work. Advancement depends on how fast you want to move up in the company, the faster you learn, the faster you grow withing the company. Benefits are great. The only downside is the Work/Life Balance, some days are longer than others and the schedule is not set. Overall a great place to be at."
good,I loved working with people and loved that I would put smiles on my customers faces that they would come in for one thing and they would walk out with more than what they expected

good,"RAC is an almost perfect employer. RAC pays extremely well, and offers benefits to all full-time employee. You never have to work on Sundays or major holidays and they are always offering performance incentives and bonus opportunities. However you have to work every Saturday unless you are on vacation or have used 1 of the 2 sick days your allowed per year. Your leave time is dependent upon meeting credit expectations. For example just because the store closes at 6PM on Saturdays, doesnt mean its actually closed. You dont leave until your at the credit expectation. So you may be at work until 9pm on a Saturday if need be."
good,Meet different people everyday to work with.. Easy to learn but must have a certain amount of sales for each position.It is a performance base career and you can easily be terminated if your not meeting your numbers.

good,was a great place to work for and management was good pay was fair for being part time but there was not really any advancement opportunities just not that big of a work place for that
good,Loved working at Rent A Center. Coworkers were excellent and there are plenty of opportunities for advancement. Benefits and pay are great and hours are reasonable.
good,this job helps you to stay in shape. it also helps you brush up on your people skills.you have to really be ready to work some crazy hours. but... the pay is some what ok. should get paid a little more for your extremely hard work with moving the furnature in and out of some of the customers homes

good,"My day at work is e coming in about 4:00pm and greeted by all of my co-workers and sometimes the customers who are inside. I clock in and take the time to ask my co-workers, in the office, what has happen so far, so I can help them out. I report to my boss to see what can be done. He sends me out on deliveries and pick ups and sometimes, but the most important thing on my to-do-list, to pick payments. If i'm not doing any of those, I stand out front in the store, cleaning product on our floor or setting them up, doing a little maintenance on the product in the back of the store, and answering the phone. When its time to close, i take out the trash and lock all doors before leaving. My most favorite part of my day is leaving the store to go make deliveries. The hardest part of my job is paperwork, i wish there was a app to do all the online signing so I don't have carry so much paper with me.The store is always cold and quiet, sometimes i enjoy it, but most times, i rather have some music playing."

good,Es buen trabajo solo falta mejorar los horarios por que es casi todo el dia
good,Being bilingual was a bonus. It helped me advance in my career. Very united team. Even management would help and work as a team like almost a family. Even clients  were very respected.
good,"I would have to say RAC is a great job for a single man/woman because the days can be long and your don't get off on weekend, if don't have a problem working nights and weekend."
good,This place is great they are all about their employees and the training is amazing. The company is always willing to take ideas and try them out and always takes care of their employees. There is tons of incentives and good hard work is acknowledged appreciated and rewarded. They do a lot of little fun competitions between stores in your market to make normal operations fun and exciting.
good,day starts with review of the week to date and month to date numbers so we can gage what we need to accomplish to reach or exceed those numbers. also start reaching out to customers in regards to payments on their accounts. management is team and goal oriented. coworkers are a pleasure to work with everyone pulls his or her own weight. hardest part of the job is the collection process. seeing satisfied customer's is the most enjoyable part of the job.

good,My day consisted of balancing multiple rental accounts as well as maintaining an office and sales floor. Working for this company I learned how to be a professional in all aspects of the workforce. The management system was very unstable and unreliable. The most difficult part of this job was getting maintaining accounts with solid customers for a long period of time. The most enjoyable part of this job was making sales through suggestive selling and one-on-one interaction.
good,great company to work for. fast paced so time goes by very fast. rapidly advance and promotions.
good,Work day was busy. Learned furniture styles and customer service. Management was very insightful and will to teach every aspect of the job. Co workers were a team and always on the move. Hardest thing was lifting furniture up four flights of stairs. Most fun was the interaction with the customer.
good,"Managed the payment, or lack there of, on all accounts linked to rented items from the store. Made contact with deliquent account holders and repossesed merchandise when needed."
good,"had a great experience with the company, and was able to learn and see new things"
good,great pay and benefits. alot of ways to advance. the management wasnt so great.
good,"This is a physical job and a good company to work for, if you have a family it can become a hassle."
good,"I go to work every day. I work from 8am until 8pm.I work long hours but with the staff that I have,it makes the day goes by fast. we joke around but at the same time,we get the job done."
good,"RAC is a really good, fun and rewarding place to work. Everyone is willing to help you do better and improve you people skills. It's very rerwarding to see a customer happy to get their merchandise and even better when they pay it off. At RAC you will deal with learn about all walks of life and it changes how you approach you job and your life."
good,"This was a very learning company, they trainned me to deal with customers, they were very helpfull for me, thats why today its easier for me to work and understand customers from any country...."
good,"Good benefits, love problemsolving and working with people . Team skill building"
good,Working five and a half days a week for 4+ years has been difficult but rewarding.
good,"Manage rental accounts and meet company account management goals and expectations, by collecting (Collections) on past due accounts while adhering to company standards. To meet the company percentages every week. Obtain new rental orders over the phones and on the sales floor, and cashier. Complete and verify credit applications on all customers."
good,No day is the same. You are constently dealing with different customers and coworkers and stores. It starts with making the store appealing for customers to want to redo their homes with RAC. Doing the backround check on each customer is where it comes either easy or hard to collect the money each week/month on each person. Management in my district made work an enjoyable place due to tthe fact that they all help you and they try to help every employee work towards advancing in a short period of time. The best part of my day is renting to customers and trying to exceed our daily goals. The hardest part was trying to get my employees to manage their time in a good fashion manner.
good,Great place to work on and develop people skills. Learn new management skills on a daily basis. Also collection and route management skills.
good,Franchise locations  have different standards and are easier to advance with. They dont have the strict regulations like a corporate store. I love it.
good,My job at Rent-A-Center is very peaceful not many altercations with a positive work environment management is top-of-the-line coworker relations are pretty decent no customer complaints good energy when making a delivery for picking up
good,I have really enjoyed my time working for Rent-A-Center at the Field Support Center! Everyone is very supportive and there is plenty of room to advance within the company.
good,Working for RAC was an amazing experience. I learned better communication skills and learned how to deal with disgruntled clients. It taught me better time management as well.
good,"I loved this job and everything about it. It was very easy all I really had to do was pick up and deliver furniture, everyone there worked as a team and were always very helpful"
good,"muy buena empresa en desarrollo laboral, trabajo en equipo buen horario de trabajo lo mas difícil fue interectuar con los clientes, pero lo que mas me gusto es que mi jefe de tienda  me capacito muy bien para poder cumplir mis metas de ventas por semana que eran 18 y siempre hacia 21 y eso fue lo que mas me gusto que perdí el miedo de hablar con los clientes "
good,The job was technically me show myself what i am capable of and showing my manager that i was eager. However i was discriminated against for being a woman a lot of the time i worked that so i had to leave. The were nice until they kept mentioning that i couldn't do the things that men do; even though i prove to them time and time againg that i can do even better than the lazy men there.
good,"RAC is consistently working to make the employees comfortable in their working environment. From a Gym, Game Room, Library and Lunchroom. The campus is also nice to walk around outside and get fresh air throughout the work day."
good,I enjoyed working for them. First job dealing with the public on a daily basis learned how to sale and upsale.   Only thing i g I didn't like  was the collection part..
good,Started off as a regular sales associate the more time I spent and learned the company had a opportunity to became assistant store manager it’s stressful when it comes to dealing with customers who refuse to pay rental payment are don’t want to return merchandise
good,"I liked working with this company because it was very fast paced and competitive. Always a thrill to see if we were in first place from our district. The hours were long, 50 hours a week was mandatory in NY branches but I didn't mind."

good,"Great place to work, had a great team and management rocked. Up management was easy to talk to about any problems. Hated to see store close and taken over by easy home"

good,working here thought me great leadership. Management was great and awarded good workers. everybody was full time. company always bought us lunch. a lot of help to move up in the company.
good,"I started with Rent A Centers a delivering and picking up merchandise, then got promoted to account manager which I was assigned a route which I had to maintain customers payments were on time and if not call and follow up to get payment as well as still delivering and picking up merchandise. Then got promoted to sales manager did that for a couple of months and always made our sales goal if not exceeded our sales goal. All within my firdt year with the company got promoted to store manager"
good,"We came in and enjoyed what we did, from start to finish we did our best to make a well functioning and desirable store for the local communities. I would definitely recommend for someone who wants to have a good life and work balance."
good,"In this work, the challenge was to increase the sales portfolio for the Hispanic community, being able to satisfactorily achieve this challenge. And be able to introduce improvements to the process of finding new customers."
good,"Unlock the store. Clean the store. Open store for business to the public. Sales and collections all day. Customer service, as well as bank deposits on a daily basis."
good,Work for them for 5 + years account manager at first. Moved up quickly. Great training and got lots of good jobs and keep the money flowing their way. Only bad thing is if you got to store manager they had a life of only 2 years.
good,Challenging but fun work place always busy an pay evaluation every 6 months also offers good health insurance . Rent a center also offers goals for stores for pirzes which involves great team work
good,I liked this place it was an easy job. I loved ti go to work each day because everyone was nice that i worked with. It was so laid back an relaxing i would go back
good,Great opportunity for entry level workers. Great management. Flexible hours. The pay is ok. If you would like to advance then you would have to make sales.
good,"A typical day includes sales marketing, customer relations, inventory. Very friendly place to work at, all stores within the district are always helping each other out. Friendly competition, keeps you  on your toes to be great and strive for more."
good,Work culture very good. So many technologies we can work. Very decent management. Diversified teams. CIO and the leadership very approachable. Good to be part of the team.
good,"It's a fun job you get paid every week. You really never in the store you always on a delivery so you never stuck in one place all day, they start you off at a good pay $10.75"
good,I ABSOLUTELY LOVED working for Rent A Center! They taught me pretty much EVERYTHING I know in the Sales Management business. The training was intense but it was well worth it. I was fortunate to have and AMAZING team in Hilo and my Boss really took her time to be sure I knew EVERYTHING I needed to succeed. Sales events and promotions were my new found LOVE and I'd go back to Rent A Center in a heartbeat!
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed working for Rent-A-Centre. I felt as though we were more then co-workers, we were a work family. Every day was a new learning experience, and with the help of management and fellow co-workers, I found myself flourishing. I built confidence in myself, and was able to continue so by training others. I was sad to leave Rent-A-Centre, but I looked forward to expanding my knowledge and meeting new people at Easy Home. "

I enjoyed the fact that I could sell them not only what they needed but what they wanted in their lives and help them reach ownership of that dream"
good,I'd still be working for Rent-A-Center had I not gone on medical leave and am under prescribed medication to not operate heavy machinery.
good,"I loved working at this place, was like a second home. Long hrs but always got the work done. Never not have anything to do .the hardest part was the best part not only are you lifting heavy merchandise your staying fit as well."
good,Had alot of fun and experience working with Rent A Center. Learned alot. Co-workers were friendly and helpful. If it wasn't because it was to far and there was no means of public transportation I would have stayed there.
good,"a very professional environment, excellent co- workers and company expectations were great.  "
good,"Rent A Center as an exciting, competitive working environment. Corporate keeps co workers motivated by having competitions against each other within a district to hit company standard expectations. Day goes by fast that before you know it, its time to go home. RAC also has online coarses to teach about selling strategies"
good,Iam very serious while on the job. No room for letting your guards down. Work hard show respect and kindness to all nothing less is exspected.
good,While the job can be tough at times the over all atmosphere was a pleasant one while working for the company. This is a great starting out job to get you away from the fast food world and into a real career.
good,I think RAC is a good place to work. This company is one of the Top companies in the Rent-to-own industry. Competitive pay with good benefits. There are plenty of opportunities for advancement and you gain valuable skills that can transfer to other careers as well.
good,I don't plan on working with Rent a Center again but it's a great way to start a great career for someone who looking to work in the Rent to own /customer service field

good,"Overall it’s an awesome company to work for, it just doesn’t pay enough to be honest, well certain positions do pay well.. but most positions pay the bare minimum"
good,Rent a center is a awesome place with great customer service and is a great place to work for all the time. I would tell everyone that hasn't been there to get there now not later.
good,I like Rent A Center a lot it was mobile I always learned something new and I was young so to me it was fun the only downfall was that the job wasn’t enough to take constant care of a home.
good,Working at rent a center was very different compared to the other two jobs i had. You were always on your feet and always moving making sure that everything came out right for that day. Always making sure that the customers are satisfied with the merchandise they received .

good,cleaned store picked up and dropped off merchandise took payments over the phone and in the store did inventory on a daily helped staff with pickups put tables and dressers together

good,Me parece una empresa muy buena ya que tiene muchos beneficios para sus empleados de igual manera tiene crecimiento laboral muy rápido y sus beneficios para los clientes son muy buenos ya que ninguna tienda ofrece
good,Rent a center is a great working environment and a great place to meet people but you have to make alot of collection calls. And sometimes go out to and get the merchandise is the downfall.

good,"Great working environment, good management, great benefits, and a fun job. I enjoyed working here. I was sad to leave, but life had other plans for me."
good,"A typical day is customer service. Talking on the phone, answering questions and finding out how you can help the customer base while making sales goals for the company and the store you work for."
good,"If this job were to ever ask me to come back, I wouldn’t even think twice. It’s a great experience and my team was great! Absolutely loved this job! And benefits were even better !!"

good,lo que me gusto de trabajar en rac fue el horario flexible para laborar

good,"I love my job, I plan on moving up in the company, hopefully to have my own store one day. I've only been with Rent A Center a couple of months but I see myself going far in the Rent A Center company. Mostly good customers, and co-workers. I would highly recommend trying to get a job there."
good,"good and fun place to work"
good,"This was hands down the very best job I had.  My reason is because it gave me the experience and life lessons to be able to get the career I have had with the Bureau of Prisons.  I have put in for several positions within the Bureau of Prisons.  Each job I have been referred forward on a list of other applicants who best qualify.  Rent A Center gave me that ability qualify for HR, Business Office, and Unit Team."

good,"Learn a lot of thing From Rent a Center, Show me how to be a Great Manager. One of the best job that i ever had and always made sure my staff was doing their job."
good,"Working for rent a center you get to meet new people every day and being a employee at rent a center you also meet new people and they become your family. Working at rent a center you can take on different types of jobs and they are not stressful jobs but being a renter center employee you get to show people how it feels to be treated with respect and kindness and guide them into being helping with the merchandise that they  pick out, Because customers are 100 percent right all the time you can always help customers out on the merchandise that they need and talk to them and see what there budget is so they don't go over it and that way we don't have to go and pick it back up. At rent a center our goal is to put it in the customers home and see to it that they can afford it and own it one day with out rent a center having to pick it up. Rent a center wants the customers to be 100 percent satisfied and Happy with there merchandise if you have satisfied customers and they are treated with respect and kindness then them people are going to tell their friends and family and that is more customers that rent a center will gain and move more merchandise,  But working with rent a center that is the best place to work."

good,"my experience at rent a center was very good. A typical day at work always left a lasting impression on me and they always helped me reach my goals not only as an employee but in life as well. the meetings not only pushed me, but they inspired and pushed the whole staff as well. things that i learned was having good people skills as far as communication and always remember to respect your customers and staff, and most importantly yourself. sometimes the most challenging part that i dealt with i would say was probably the whole labor when i was a delivery driver but there's good days and there's bad days.  one of the main culture of the job that i learned was taking care of the customer at all cost. no matter what happens always make sure the customer is satisfied."

good,"Rent a center was by far my favorite job, it was relaxed but also quick paced at times. delivering furniture was the hardest part of my job being short in frame and small in over all size. but having a healthy work place and more than helping coworkers made it worth while."
good,Work was calm and nice you had plenty of time to sit and think but when business started to flow you were moving none stop days go by fast at Rent A center
good,This job isn't geared towards women as they are required to go out on delivery and deliver heavy objects sometimes alone. pretty difficult for a woman to do
good,Love working for this coming and all the management team and the District manager is the best person to work for. I highly recommend anybody to come and work for this company.

good,"I like helping people and providing excellent customer service; these jobs entailed cashier, title loan, and customer service representative positions in which I performed the same duties albeit in varied capacities.

good,"Administrative medical assistants are responsible for a multitude of tasks that include communicating with patients, scheduling appointments, electronic medical coding, filing insurance claims, maintaining records, as well as accounting and billing."
good,I loved Rent A Center. It was fast paced but also slow paced. Some days deliveries were crazy other days there were only a few. Sometimes you get to travel a few hours away to get merchandise from another store and get to see some beautiful sites like I did in southern Ohio.

An account representative manages customer accounts and we do our best to try and make a customer happy and worry free when he or she feels like they can no longer afford their merchandise. Figuring out ways to make it so that your customer stays with us. losing a customer is the worst feeling. The more customers you lose, the less the store makes and it means the less that the company needs employees if you know what im saying. Ive held on strong for a year and a half now. the hardest part of the job has to be collections and dealing with customers who feel that they can make a payment whenever they feel like it. My current store manager has to be the best manager there is.
