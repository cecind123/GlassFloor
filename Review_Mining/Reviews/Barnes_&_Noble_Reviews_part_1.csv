rating,review
bad,"The management at this store was completely inept; when they aren't simply pulling tills, existing within their own to make displays and talk about the rest of the employees, and doing literally the same job as the Booksellers on the floor they are reading statistics or holding pointless meetings that accomplish nothing. There is no training program either beyond a binder with poorly-writtenC outdates, and confusing instructions. Worst work experience I've had, despite countless promises of inclusivity and attention to employee needs."
bad,The managers pick their favorites and give th the first choice on shifts. Also there is no support in the cafe so although was a bookseller I spent the majority of my time covering for the cafe. The management is very liberal and political
bad,"Management refuses to hire any new employees, They send out emails stating they will be looking for other candidates months and months later. They do ""Phone"" interviews and never call back but months later send out emails refusing any new person, It's like they only prefer students."
bad,"No hours, extremely early lunches sometimes an hour after getting to work, like pulling teeth to get someone to cover when it's break time, just all around unhappy with the company"
bad,"So understaffed most of the time, very stressful place. Working in the cafe was horrible. The manager is lazy and does not do anything and when we are busy she always disappears. The coworkers were nice and made you feel welcomed. The pay was not worth it for how much you had to work."
bad,While you will meet some amazing booksellers and people in general Barnes and Noble as a company does not care about their employees. I have worked for this company for 16 years in 3 different stores some managers are worse then others and forget asking the”we listen” line for help it’s not confidential and only hurts the reporting bookseller in the end.
bad,"They expect more from their employees than is humanly possible for very little pay. Also the B&N corporate takes every opportunity to make terrible business decisions, then cuts hours for employees to make up for it."
bad,Terrible place ownership and management use this place for there own twisted political views . I will never work here or shop here again. BUYER AND WORKER BEWARE
bad,"Barnes and Noble is a company that puts its employees last on its list of priorities. The only kind of benefit this company gives you is an employee discount that keeps getting smaller. "
bad,"The managerial system was corrupt. Unfortunately, they could get away with discrimination since it was not caught or recorded on cameras. Local people report the managers (and some workers) here are ""slightly"" racist. They often comment on the lack of diversity in the work place. "
bad,IT sucked working there. There are NO café managers. Everyone is quitting and your left alone a lot even when your new. They throw you in there and assume you can handle a whole bunch of customers and drinks when you barely have any of the information in your head on how to make things. Managers could care less what happens in café. You work really hard and not paid for all the things you experience.
bad,"It may have been fun a decade ago but these days, this bookstore is a disaster. Everyone from the corporate office down to our District Manager and Store Manager have been horrible to work for and with. They are so fake to your face then they'll report you for something stupid and throw you under the bus for they're responsibilities. I cant see this company lasting much longer, they've insulted our good regular customers as well as our best employees.Not only do I not recommend working for this company, I strongly recommend you shop elsewhere!"
bad,"This company seems to care more about numbers then the people, most if not all the managers I worked with couldn’t be bothered with the ideas I had, nor the less then up to par working conditions they have. The cafe is a a disaster. My first day I stopped the training to clean black mold. Let all the managers know the health code violation we were in Bc of it. No one was held accountable because of the inaction. Not one person would listen when it came to organization. Just all round a mess. Not to mention most of the employees were afraid to say anything for they would lose hours."
bad,"A typical day at Barnes & Noble was frustrating to say the least. Lots of customers but not enough staff. They stated the mantra of ""customer service"" and treating the customers with empathy, yet the management couldn't even lead by example, were passive/aggressive and spoke down to you. Management had you read a manual to try and figure out the job on your own. Calling on them for assistance was a joke. They would look at you like you were crazy for asking a question. Their expectation levels were way to high for the number of employees they had on any given shift. I'd say this was the worst retail store and management I've ever worked for."
bad,"They claim this is a part time position but it’s really not. They’ll have you on the schedule 4-5 days a week, 9 hour days with a 30 minute lunch,  with awful pay, you’re better off finding try part time work else where. They’re also extremely pushy about telling people about the membership."
bad,"I worked at Barnes and Noble in Reno, NV as a Warehouse Clerk. I'm of Hispanic decent, however, I was shocked and utterly surprised that the supervisor would conduct her morning meetings in Spanish when there were obviously other workers who were not of Hispanic decent and did not understand the language. I found it highly offensive. This facility seems to have a bias in hiring Hispanics. There were maybe a handful of workers who did not understand the language and who were not of Hispanic descent. I felt terrible for them because they would ask what was said in the meeting. It also felt like a prison. During our orientation, we were given a clear fanny pack to use to carry our belongings in because security will check your bags when exiting the metal detectors, which you also have to go through to get to your station. There is a bell that goes off for each break, which also make you feel like a prisoner. The break rooms are a distance away from your work area, so you have to make sure to rush to get a bathroom break and quickly eat your meal because if you do not get back in time, you are being talked to. I absolutely not recommend this place unless you are absolutely desperate."
bad,This job is essentially high school with adults. The management honestly believes they are the cast of mean girls. There is definitely a culture of a weird type of bullying that is masked as the management staff pretending to be your friend. If you suck up to them you will be well-liked. If you show up to do your job that isn't good enough. You must befriend management to have a positive experience in the union square store.
bad,"Management was horrendous. Sure, it's great to work here if you have no other option. At least, this is true for the Huntington Beach Branch in CA. It is clear as to why, Barnes and Noble is dying."
bad,"The store in ridgecrest was small. At a glance one would think it would be a nice inviroment but the office lady made spiteful comments to me and directed to to me because my glasses were thick and it took me a little longer at times to find the screw numbers or names of books. Her rudeness made what I thaught would be a pleasant work inviroment streful and I ended up quitting because her rudeness made me feel bad about myself because I know I have to wear glasses, but no one likes likes to be poked fun of or be the center of jokes behind ones back. As a book store- I like the store in Glendale but the store in ridgecrest was small minded and a real bed sore."
bad,"I highly disliked this job due to the managements unwillingness to listen to employees issues. Such an unorganized management team. The pay sucks and my little brother who worked at Bojangles in my middle of nowhere town even made more per hour than I did. You may get assigned to one position for a certain day, but you will be working all positions because “someone was sick” or “no one else wants to”. I even contacted the corporate office concerning the ridiculous mess that my store was and they offered 0 help. Never work there unless you’re ready to be payed a fraction of what you’re owed for the work you do and to be screamed at for not doing a job that isn’t your responsibility."
bad,This is was the worst job I ever had. They took advantage of how hard I worked by refusing to respect my time and refusing to pay me more. I hesitate to even shop at Barnes & Noble anymore.
bad,I feel as if i was highly discriminated against I worked at the Barnes and Noble bookstore at Northern Virginia Community college in Manassas VA. I was let go because I didn't know how to properly use a box cutter. I feel as if I should've been trained instead of being removed from the team.
bad,"Terrible job, forces you to stay late after closing by force and demands you to come early for morning shifts. Will work you to death during busy seasons even though we are always understaffed no matter what, especially during the slow seasons because they just cut people's hours without care of if they can pay for the rent because the company only cares about their own profits. I was harassed by a lead and a manager who had anger issues and would threaten customers all the time and nothing was done in either situation. I was blocked by the lead manager to get in contact with HR over the harassment I was dealing with for over months at that point. I was promised by managers that I would get a response or hear back over what happened and nothing. Management is terrible, always had to deal with homeless people and drug addicts in the store as well and manager didn't care about our own safety, just told me to keep it quiet around customers when I had to deal with the same addict multiple times and afraid for my own safety. Easiest store to steal from because they don't have their own security and always understaffed so never enough people to keep eyes on anything at all in the store. Discount is not even worth much, better to just save your money and buy off of Amazon. I can't wait until they go out of business because you deserve to. Four hour shifts is utterly insane and still I hear people getting hours cut to two hours or just sent home once they arrive to work. They also cut our discount from the B&N cafe, because they are so greedy they just want to profit more off of the"
bad,It is a terrible place to work. My managers always scheduled their favorites the best hours and threatened to fire us if we didn't reach daily goals for the rewards programs. The only pro was 20% off regularly priced items. It went up to 30% right before Christmas.
bad,Very toxic work environment. Abusive upper management. HR not helpful when I reported that I was being verbally abused and harassed by my store manager and assistant manager.
bad,The management is grossly unqualified and the store is always understaffed. The cafe was not appreciated and there was only one person who was cross trained and they wouldn’t even let her work in cafe to help if someone was working alone.
bad,"Typical cafe service, Starbucks located on second floor, 8 hour shifts, very busy around the holidays. Room for growth within the company as long as youd like to stay a barista."
bad,"Not a great place to work if you have mental health issues and managers who simply don't care about them. Interacting with customers was fine, but I feared going in every day for what type of panic attack I might have based off of the manager working that day."
bad,"At first, I loved working for Barnes & Noble. It was fun, quick paced, and full of fun loving people, but that all changed as time went on and I became more comfortable around my coworkers. The only light in the entire time I worked there was working in receiving with one of the best managers I've ever had, but Barnes & Noble didn't think his position, or the 2 head cashiers, or even the woman who did all the VOS orders, were important enough to keep, so in one fell swoop my boss, as well as 3 other coworkers were let go before they could even clock in."
bad,Staff and management was insulting. Employers do not seem to be concerned with employees. They did not show respect for their staff. Horrible experience.
bad,"company was bleeding money and instead of trying to innovate and bring in new customers they placed extreme expectations on the booksellers and baristas to badger customers about multiple promotions that were always ongoing. Management set quotas for how many drinks, memberships, promoted books etc. that you had to sell without offering any kind of incentive, customers frequently complained about the badgering remarking that it was akin to walking on the a car lot"
bad,"This is not the kind of job that can financially sustain an adult. You will have to surrender your entire schedule to management to get even close to 30 hours. Every week, the schedule changes, with only a couple days notice. "
bad,"Worked at BN for 15 years. From management to part time and every department. Beyond shady. I worked enough hours to get benefits but was ""coded"" at 12 hours so I could never get them. Full time positions were almost all eliminated they laid off great, tenured people to do it. Workload to staff ratio was exhausting. Cafe employees left alone for whole shift practically begging for a break which was covered by a manager who was barely trained in there.  No training, horrible customers, horrible pay, horrible management, no honesty, shady disrespectful upper management. It started out great but the employees are the most miserable people. All of us were on Indeed looking to jump this sinking ship. Shut it down."
bad,"Would not recommend to work here, the manager’s were not very nice they would throw you under the bus even if you didn’t mess up. The coworkers were the only good thing about working here"
bad,Poor Store Manager who has a record of losing quality and people with integrity due to harassment.  Lack of company required training.  When store manager was not present everyone worked as a team and enjoyed their day.  Producers were acknowledged.
bad,not enough help on the sales floor. The company is worried about money and is suffering. their needs to be more staff on the floor and having less focus on selling memberships
bad,"The company is constantly changing things, ignoring feedback from the store level, and cutting vital positions for no sensible reason."
bad,everyone is jumping ship no chance for advancement increasing expectations decreasing payroll doing away with full time jobs but you get to be around books.
bad,Did not enjoy working here. The mission was loosely followed and the turnover rate is ridiculous due to unruly supervisors. Will not return back to this and wouldn't recommend it.
bad,"The once great company which turned on its dedicated,most knowledgeable, best working veterans and threw them out with security."
bad,"Working in the cafe was an absolute nightmare. Other cafe workers were angry, incompetent, arrogant, and lazy. Sanitary food handling never practiced and the restaurant was filthy. Customer service skills were abysmal. If you value integrity, honesty, hard work, and healthy communication, do not work here,"
bad,low pay not many hours unless you are full time any thing less you get 10 hours if you lucky I worked there 5 years had a good boss to start It was fun at times but no money to be made.
bad,"As a lead bookseller, I reported to Corporate headquarters, that the person under me would not follow my instructions, or requests- because he enjoyed the favors of the store manager. This has remained in my file- and has prevented me from ever working for any store ever afterwards.  Most recently, this has happened with my application for work as a temporary bookseller in the Frederick, Maryland branch. It is either that, or because of my longevity, I am 64 years old now."
bad,B&N is clearly headed in a downward direction. It's a non supportive environment that I would never recommend. 
bad,"it was not a nice place to work they treated us like we meant nothing at all, they were always looking at us and they thought we were not getting our work done, to me they seemed to be a little racist"
bad,"Barnes and Noble is a company competing against itself, barely managing to keep brick and mortar stores open when their online store is out competing itself.  They don't price match anything, even themselves, which leads to intensely awkward and uncomfortable situations for the in store employees.  They also pay incredibly poorly and the benefits are lackluster.  Plenty of PTO days are offered, but employees are strongly discouraged from using them."
bad,This store is poorly ran. This company has no compassion for the working conditions they place their employees in. Always chaotic with minimal staff so workers are working extra hard. Retail at it's worst.
bad,Not a good place to work. Won't be around very much longer. Punitive culture that pushes you to increasingly unrealistic goals. Compensation is pitiful.
bad,"Cut throat, brutal management, highly stressful, ridiculous, insane, unnecessary nonsense, bad management, over the top, mean, nasty, unfair, inhumane."
bad,The only way to advance is to be a total yes man and to kiss butt. I wasn't a buddy to management and got screwed over every chance they got. No one there cares about you if you don't blow smoke up their butts.
bad,Low pay. Long hours. No advancement. Poor management. Rude customers. No time to complete your tasks. Poor supervision. No communication. Bad place to spend time.
bad,"I was at a Barnes and Noble that just so happened to be attached to a mall, so working in the cafe was much much busier than other stores. However, you couldn't tell with the leadership. They ran a pretty shoddy ship. At this point, though, the people I worked with are no longer with the company."
bad,Self explanatory - terrible management at every level including regional. They just kept replacing bad managers with worse ones. The store will be closed in the next year.
bad,"My employment at Barnes and Noble was dissapointing because I was not compensated well for the work performed, the store was not well managed and it was not a pleasant work experience"
bad,"Always understaffed"
bad,"no benefits and part time hours, the pay was minimum wage. Pretty slow paced work environment. there were not many opportunities to advance in this company"
bad,"This was once a wonderful place to work, but in the past year it has gone down hill, expectations have become unrealistic and there has been a mass exodus of management. New management has been poorly trained and the corporation as a whole gives off an unorganized air."
bad,"Could be different else where, in Spokane, it's the pits.Management above store manager level is very two faced. Advancement only happens if you really agree with district managers at all times. Store managers need to step up and defend their people. If a concern happens or training is needed then give the time needed. Manage the stores as they are your own. Not every square peg fits the round hole. All the training and seminars that are given to store managers on how to treat people need to start at district manager level.However, store managers are also afraid to not agree or they will soon lose their job."
bad,"Absolute worst place I have ever worked at. "
bad,"If you want to make some extra money during holiday season, it's worth the risk. But that's it. When the year starts, they cut your hours dramatically and without notice. When you ask about it, that store manager lady tells you so many stupid lies, and expects you to believe in her bs. She basically underestimates your brains. And they are so lazy, that the computer system BY ITSELF does the schedule, therefore messing with work/personal lives of employees. Not to mention the pressure to sell those lame memberships that only pays off if the customer but at least $250 worth of merchandising that year. So, overall, it might be a good experience if you're a student. But if you live in the real world, has bills to pay, and want something worthwhile for your life, don't even waste your time applying. You might as well make the same amount of money washing cars or cutting grass."
bad,"This is just like any other part-time job... except with a lot more passive aggressive people. Don't expect to get honest answers from your managers, as they'll just give you an attitude and ask you to look at the handbook. "
bad,very unorganized and messy management. Worked in a college store and management reflected such. Horrible experience very little direction
bad,"In a typical day: dealing with customers, sales, organizing, cleaning and making orders. Flexible hours, good co-workers, tons of deliveries, little space to place stuff!"
bad,"Working here was probably the worst mistake of my life. They managed to hold out on our checks and not give us the pay we earned. First week you're overworked, 35-40 hours, then you're lucky to get 3 days a week. Management is petty, they seem to think this is just a high school girls bathroom where they can talk about whoever and no one hears about it. They can take as long as they can on lunch breaks but if we're a minute late were reprimanded? We're ALL supposed to get only 30 minutes."
bad,"Very much a double standard with this company.  Be very careful if you feel development is important.  The company does not.  DO NOT call we listen if you disagree with something.  You will receive a bad mark on your review.  My store had one of the best metrics in the Region, and the fact I did not kiss my DM's butt made my life miserable.  Be careful!!!"
bad,Tyrannical management and blatant favoritism!!!  A manager who lies through her teeth to get you in the door with false promises of promotion; an incompetent assistant manager
bad,would not recommend working for this company. They will not be around much longer. Very poor work environment and employee morale.
bad,"This job is practically destroyed by management. They force you to sell memberships and if you don't reach their quota, they fire you. The best thing is that the team is reliable. But the managers, especially in White Plains, NY have the worst attitudes. They don't work with your school schedule. "
bad,After being the go-to person for 6 years (and 3 years of that asking for a raise to management) I get a promotion. They then proceed to railroad me b/c they don't want that store open any longer (which they can't close it). They've never been able to keep managers at the store long enough before they quit.
bad,"I like working with customers and helping them."
bad,"I worked at my local Barnes and Noble in the Cafe. We had a manager and lead in the cafe yet the store manager was such a control freak she and the assistant manager required us to call them before we could take breaks. They never scheduled enough of us to work at one time, we were basically a small fast food store inside the B&N yet we rarely had more than two people working at any given time, even during the holidays. The Store and assistant managers constantly came over and belittled us, talked to us like we were too stupid to do our jobs, and thought they knew more about the position than we, the people actually doing it, did, because ""We've had the training too."" Nothing was ever done to their standards and we always took to long to do everything."
bad,"boring not interested and people do not notice you. Not great experience, supervisor did not know you were there."
bad," At Barns and Noble the main goal of the day is to make sure each customer leaves satisfied. Not only do they sell school stuff, but they sell other things like clothing or anitvirus software for the computer also speakers and cameras anything you could use in school and to keep you intertained out of school."
bad,"The management is driven just to get paid. They truly don't care about their employees, which causes a hostile environment of employees vs. employers. It's low pay and the stress is not worth the effort at the end of the day."
bad,"No oppurtunities for career advancement, no raises."
bad,"Everyone was cold and had their strange little cliques. Management included. I worked there for a few months before I ""accidently"" saw my file. I read the notes from my 1st interview with a lower manager and I was surprised I was even called for a second interview! Worked there for a few months and then moved."
bad,A great place to work. Did quality control here and learned a lot about different ways to do quality work
bad,"The company is very corporate. They’re all about how much money they can get out of a person. They minimally care about employees or moral. It’s kind of a “make those membership goals, or get fired” kind of place. I would NEVER work for this company again."
bad,I have never worked for a management staff that could suck the life and energy out of a staff quite like here. I regret staying there as long as I did.
bad,"This failing company was the absolute worst job I've ever had. They're sinking fast, and cutbacks are evident in everything. Now that they're under new management all they care about is sales. Although you can't make more people come into the store, it will somehow be your fault if they don't."
bad,"there is no room for advancement, everyone gets the same raise, new hires start at the same wage that people who have been there for years make, and you are expected to work in all areas of the store (cafe included), often all within the same shift. Expectations are not the same from employee to employee, expect to have to pick up a lot of slack"
bad,"Not a great place to work. Very lazy store manager, not willing to work around your schedule. Too many homeless and drug addicts in the store and the pay is not worth what you have to deal with."
bad,"This place is only good as a quick temporary job for the desperate. The corporation and management has no idea what they're doing and they'll find anyone working  under them to blame. They have no respect for their employees and it's truly a thankless job. I've never worked for a place where good people just disappear with no explanation. And it's happened many, many times."

They have no respect for their employees and it's truly a thankless job. I've never worked for a place where good people just disappear with no explanation. And it's happened many, many times."
bad,"Worse warehouse,  manager some where  had bad personalities, an not helpful, at all, an they made you work overtime, alot even when you didnt wanna work overtime, on sundays, on your days off. Espically working swing shift."
bad,"I started out in the cafe. I was trained well and the cafe management was great. The problem? Although I was getting paid minimum wage, I was doing what the managers were doing, but without the benefits. When the managers weren’t there, I was told by the bookfloor and general managers to call/write in and put away the orders, call mechanics, and other things I had no training on. There also were many, many times that I was in the cafe all by myself for an hour at a time during a rush. Twice just happened to be when the food and milk order came. Even the regulars started to notice."
bad,"This was an enticing opportunity that has potenital to help the company grow, but they're unwilling to fully invest. The retail industry is failing and they are feeling the hit tremendously. I tried my best to juggle the various facets of business but our division is not built to develop that business on an enterprise level. The change was constant and confusing. Communication was obsolete. You are certainly not appreciated for the business you bring in, but chastised and disrespected for when you can't achieve unrealistic/fabricated goals that don't coincide with the landscape of the business."
bad,"Many great co-workers, but overall not very well-managed. Often scrambling to cover the entire store during regular multiple call outs with no replacement while still expected to complete all regular tasks."
bad,"Run away.  Starting pay for Head Cashier is $8.75 and maximum pay for any lead is $12..  Full time hours were 36.5 per week.  Education reimbursement?  Yes, it's in the handbook, but Head Cashiers do not receive a set schedule.  There needs to be 100% availability, so forget about going to school.   I was told I could put in vacation time, or else step down to a part time bookseller position (16 hours or less). Managers sit in the office and watch the monitors to see what's happening."
bad,Orem location has worst management I've ever worked for. Very down grading and mico manage. No coaching or do they really value their employees.
bad,They gave me a position as a manger around sept promising full time. Once the holiday season was over they conveniently terminated me for leaving the store to smoke outside as I did all those months with no complaints. But since we didn't meet our store goal they were cutting the fat. Terminated me after i left my job of 3 years to work for them. Horrible experience.
bad,I was told that I was interviewing for shipping and receiving but when I started I was put on the floor pulling orders for customers. They put you to train with coworkers but I could not understand what they were saying and they couldn't answer my questions because they didn't speak English. I was not paid for the first day and never received the money. The supervisor was late and we did not punch in so they assume you are not there and don't pay you. The money is not good for the amount of work they have you doing.
bad,A days  work  coworkers dont speak english management speaks spanish  to amercians
bad,"My duties included retail sales, customer service, and cashier services."
bad,"Bad experience, horrible management and felt I was set up to fail from the beginning.  First time I've experienced an environment like this.  I thought working for a company like ""Barnes and Noble Corporate office would be a great experience.  It was the complete opposite.  No room for growth at least in the corporate office."
bad,"Constantly understaffed, overworked, and underpaid. Each day was a battle with management to get them to see how the cafes should be run. Co-workers were alright, however, the turn over rate was higher than any other business in the area. This was due to management. There was little to no chance that someone would be promoted to manager from within. I learned how not to run a business from this store."
bad,I had a micromanager manager. Enough was never enough. Sales were very heavy and it bothered customers who were trying to have a nice time. Manager was new and over the top.
bad,"Manager overlooked many employees who were well deserving of a leadership position, all the good ones left, and now they have a high turn over rate. Everyone who left became successful elsewhere, while the few who remained, still in the same positions."
bad,"Throughout my 2 years working for this company, I have seen it go from decent to absolutely unacceptable. Once they randomly laid off over a thousand full time employees, it totally went downhill. They expect part-time workers to do the work of the former full-timers with no raise. Most recently, there have been issues with our store manager regarding racism and sexism that have not been addressed and instead swept under the table. They will also text you on your days off, during your vacation time, and even when you are unavailable to work. Then they will give you a hard time when they see you in person for not answering. I had to cut back my hours for a college class and my manager threatened to hire another person and cut my hours to almost nothing even though I can work every single opening shift into the afternoon and all day on the weekends. They will also force you to train in the cafe even when you have bronchitis and an allergy to coffee grounds. There is no concept of seniority with new hires getting paid more than those who have been there for years, an unspoken raise cap, and no benefits. I contacted HR about a few things and my Store Manager used intimidation tactics to try to get me to quit."
bad,"While working here, you will notice that while people are coming to your face smiling, they are plotting your demise. Dramatic? yes, but that's what you're working with. Beware of the snakes! Be fake, and you'll be a manager before you know it!"
bad,Management is poor in the Cafe. workers are undervalued and underappreciated. My location management was completely incompetent. Previous manager was excellent. Cafe is very busy you will often go without breaks and lunches while your manager decides to stock displays even with lines out the door. Favoritism runs rampant. Less favored employees have hour cuts regardless of their work ethic or ability. If you like being on your feet and working hard you'll do fine if you stay out of the work politics. Very fun job when there's good management!
bad,"i have work with barnes and noble for a few years and have seen it get worse in that time. management is disrespectful, belittling, horrible with communicating changes concerning work or new policies. fail to inform employees of changes then turn around and reprimanded  us for doing something wrong that could have been avoided by using effective communication,took years to get training to do job effectively.scheduling had no consistency from week to week so very hard to plan stuff outside of work. after years of work no paid vacation and no change to move up in company, no benefits. hours would go up and down showing no stable checks for people living on their own. company cut jobs to save money showing how little they value their employees. overall would not recommend this to people living on their own but more to people living at home with family."
bad,"While this company never paid very well, the discount on books and other benefits marginally balanced it out. I also enjoyed working with people who were literate, and enjoyed reading. Sadly, the company's leadership has run this ship into the ground."
bad,Overall pretty bad. They overload the managers with projects and then slash hours so we can't staff properly to accommodate customer service or completing projects to maintain the store.
bad,"To operate the best omni-channel specialty retail business in America, helping both our customers and booksellers reach their aspirations, while being a credit to the communities we serve."
bad,"A typical day felt like a glorified librarian with too many duties. I learned that poor upper management, the ones who have the thumb on the floor managers can ruin the work experience for everyone. The workplace culture was overall enjoyable. The hardest part off the job was the closing shifts. The most enjoyable part of the job was working in the stock room for the magazines."
bad,The expectation versus the reality was very different. The sales job by the hiring manager was very compelling. That was not the reality of the culture.
bad,"Even if I was desperate I wouldn't work here again. One week I would work 28 hours and the next week I would work 10. The only good part was using dayforce to pick up shifts. Otherwise, don't work here unless you absolutely need something out of it."
bad,No room for advancement. Does not offer benefits for part time employees. Unmotivated booksellers. High turnover rate. Management cannot be trusted. Other stores may be different.
bad,A classy place to work.   But a dying business in the retail world.   Barnes and Noble was the leader in retail booksellers in the mid 90's.
bad,"Easy job with little responsibilities, all you do is make Starbucks drinks and heat up food all day. Unfortunately I had a terrible experience with management, where I was told I was up for a promotion to a shift lead, began training for the promotion, but was never actually promoted."
bad,"I learned a lot. On a typical day, I would simply do my job and do my work. I learned how to deal with people who had opinions that were different than mine, along with their mindsets. People were pretty corrupt though. Be careful."
bad,"B&N is a company that has lost its way.  In my 6 years with them they cut store payrolls by 40%, and in doing so have removed the souls of those that work there and love books.  The biggest reason to go to a book store, a book recommendation, is dead.  This is because of minimum staffing levels and minimum wage hiring have kept prolific readers from applying and current staff.  Existing staff are overworked, underappreciated, and actively discouraged from spending time developing relationships with customers by taking the time to suggest titles and authors.  What good is B&N if all you get there is a search assistant and a cashier?  You really can go to Amazon for that.  If B&N wants to survive they need to go back to being more than that."
bad,I  help  customers   locate  products  throughout the  store.   I  learn  how   the   retail  stores  operated.   my   coworkers  were friendly.   the  hard  part  of   about  the   job   crazy  customers
bad,expected to manage a store while working as crew member of store.
bad,"I would think twice about joining htis company. It seems like a fun inviroment at first, but the lack of the training they give will be held against you."
bad,"Scheduling is not done by café manager but other store managers who know little to nothing about a food business so, most of the time they put one worker at the café alone for 3 to 5 hours, so he or she has to attend big crowds, then store managers expect you to have everything clean organize and enough food all the time and on top a happy face."
bad,Manager doesnt care for you or customers at all. I would have stayed if there was a different manager and the other employees were great. The manager talks horrible about emloyees and customers. He made me cry several times at work and while i was driving home. He was disrespectful and will talk to you with an atittude in front of customers and when yall are alone. Worst management i have ever been around and i hated it. Other managers are very sweet. All the stuff you have to do there you should be getting paid $12 or more and hour but you get paid $9.50 an hour.
bad,"Let's cut to the chase. I got a barista position and was very happy at first. Then I was told to constantly upsale and constantly bug people with 7+ questions about their order. ""Venti for 50¢ more?"""
bad,"Operating a 25,000 square foot store with only three employees on the sales floor was not only challenging, but resulted in poor customer service, decreased productivity and low morale. The main focus of higher management was reducing payroll, above all else."
bad,"Managers have no concern for the employees. The hours are flexible, but be willing to have less help when sales are low. There is little foot traffic most days. The moral is really low and management does little to nothing to help improve it."
bad,"Completely disorganized.  Employees liked to stand around and chat while I actually worked.  The managers constantly berated the actual store manager behind his back and talked about him like he was stupid.  Two-faced management.  "
bad,I just felt that the managers were very rude. I never really learned anything of value. It was very unorganized and overall I would never refer anyone to work at that particular Barnes & Noble College.
bad,"Seriously, you will regret it.  There is no work life balance.  Things can be a little better depending on the store manager you are with, but the good ones are few and far between."
bad,"Don't work for Barnes & Noble. Unfair business practices. Unfair promotion policies. Hires from outside before inside. Very disappointed with my work situation. Was told there was possibilities of upward movement. But even with hard work, all I've gotten is downward movement."
bad,The location that i worked in was not as organized as the others. This particular location is closing down. Management was unfair and worked off of favoritism.
bad,I left several times throughout 2013 to care for my mother who was  dying of cancer. I received horrible treatment from the store manager and the management team.
bad,"I was really screwed with hours. During training I was hitting 10-20 hours a week. Then after I was trained I was working 4-9 hours a week between 2 or 3 days, if I was lucky. Asked management about it and they said they had a budget with hours so they had to distribute them fairly, which was understandable until I noticed a guy that hired in the same time as me was getting triple my hours. I didn't even know it was my last week here until I came in and had to train the guy that replaced me. So in summary, management didn't bother to help me or communicate with me."
bad,"My coworkers are all very nice and there’s a very cozy working atmosphere, but they’re very demanding for how little you get paid. My location had me working about 1 day a week for an average of 6 hours. With $11.10 being my hourly pay, it was impossible to keep up with all of the payments I had to make. If you’re willing to work multiple jobs, this place might work out for you. If not, look somewhere else."
bad,"You’re expected to work any area of the store with zero notice. You never know what job you’re working until you get there. "
bad,It was a tough place to work with lots of heavy lifting. i only got a 10 minute lunch. the staff were rude. and they always expected more than i was able to do.
bad,"9 to 9.50 dollar is not going to encourage people to stay at this job. Everyone works two jobs while working here. "
bad,"Working here was miserable. Management was constantly picking at everything but didn’t even know how to do my job. Some coworkers were great others were rude. The company in general obviously didn’t care about their employees at all or even appreciate the ones who did good work. There was hardly ever enough staff and there were countless times I would be alone with no help having to ring up customers, make drinks, and food. And instead of helping me those times I was alone they would get mad at me for not “upselling” to customers when I had absolutely no time to. Overall the job is not worth what they are willing to pay."
bad,"In my 2 year Merchandise Manager stint at Barnes and Noble, I witnessed more unprofessionalism from the upper management than I could stand in my 16 year retail career. There is no consistency in merchandising, planning or executing. The customer shops are a complete disgrace to bookselling. The upper management does not care about the well being of the booksellers, only as long they are making a quota on email or membership. I've seen more booksellers thrown under the bus by the upper management, only because of lack of training from the upper management. Barnes and Noble is not what it used to be and I do not recommend working for this company."
bad,"I quit working from here because of how poorly I was treated by management. They were very much like a clique. They gossiped a lot, and if one of them didn’t like a coworker, all of them wouldn’t like that one person. One of them wouldn’t even refer to me by my own name. He would call me “this one” and wouldn’t even speak to me when I was right in front of him, and instead would tell someone else to tell me something... They told me I had to prove that I was sick in order to call off for so many days because I had the flu, so I had to come into work to show them I was incapable with handling food that day, and they still didn’t beleive me. I even called four hours ahead and they said I needed to call even earlier, and that it was my fault they were short staffed."
bad,"Working at Barnes&Noble Bookstore I have gain great customers as well as stocking,online ordering, cashier. The communication need to be worked on with management and their tone of voice when dealing with customers as well employees."
bad,"Slow days, slow nights, cashier, asking customers the same questions over and over, ""can I help you"".  Look up books, textbooks, inventory yada yada.  Boring job, DEFINITELY not enough money.  Flexible schedule, just wasn't a good job.  If you need some pocket change, literally this is what this place is.  Also, the discounts are really good.  I got like 15% or 20% I don't remember off books, which was great!"
bad,"Too little pay for too much work"
bad,"I was there for fifteen years. The first ten years were very good. My job as music manager was eliminated and I became a head cashier with 40% pay reduction. After four years as head cashier my job was eliminated again. During those four I lead the country in Member card sales, selling over 0ne thousand cards per year."
bad,"Working at Barnes & Noble in the Altamonte Mall was stressful for so many reasons. Most prominent being the management, making changes within the store that were either unnecessary or brought on more problems than they resolved. The quality of life is very low, with most employees having a desire to quit. And as for the employees, they are very catty and quick to throw whoever they can under the bus for anything that goes wrong. There's no sense of personal responsibility at this store for any mistakes made. Management is very scatterbrained and unprepared most days, like scheduling too many breaks without enough coverage, or understaffing employees on busy business days. The entire workplace environment is toxic and stressful, with very little reward."
bad,"The work itself, microwaving sandwiches, pizzas, and quiches, and memorizing and mixing hot and cold beverages, is not a problem When it got really busy, it was actually kind of fun to try and keep up with all of the orders and satisfy every customer. The main issue were the often senseless practices we were passed down from corporate, whom we never saw aside from evaluation days. Our own manager neither followed nor informed us of the proper food service practices we were meant to stick to in the cafe. The man who came to evaluate us found coffee that was years old that we, the baristas had no idea about, buried deep in our storage cabinets.  He also found all of our thermometers uncalibrated, not that we ever used them or were taught to calibrate them. We were also vague on the appropriate numbers of syrup pumps for certain beverages. All gross transgressions, I'm sure. Almost everyone quit upon finding out we failed the evaluation, feeling it was a bit too late in our barnes & noble barista careers to be finally getting trained, after the unfair pressure our unfit manager put on us to carry the store through the evaluation we were never prepared for."
bad,"Everything about working in this location isn't worth that stress and worry that it causes.  The customers can absolutely vicious, the management is uncaring and ignorant, and the workload is insane for the amount of compensation.  There are some great people looking for books sometimes, but most the customers are mean, creeps, or just hanging around.  The team that leads the staff is lazy, dumb, and overall rude to their employees.  There are exceptions again, but it still feels like a high school with the amount of interpersonal drama involved with the management.  The work is either just flat out too much to do.  Or NOTHING."
bad,Horrible job no support from management.  Went through 9 managers in 3 years and now I see position open again.  Not enough staff in cafe.  Store was dirty really not enough time and staff to clean properly.  Store manager was horrible only cared about keeping labor cost down.  Asst Managers just as bad. I do not recommend this job at the Morris Plains New Jersey store to anyone.  Terrible work environment.
bad,"when i started there it was great and my manager were awesome and helpful. The current manager since 2008 is terrible, no understanding, no trust, heartless and mean. This is such a hostile envirment to work in. There is alot of turnover in this paticular store. The company changed it focus  also."
bad,"this would have been an ideal job if the management wasn't horrible. From the get go the managers write down every conversation they have with you, even when they say its off the record. I worked with a manager who didn't like me for any particular reason and made working horrible while I was at Barnes and Noble. She would make things up about me that customers and other coworkers even said were not true. The general manager took her side and said that I needed to change and when asked in what areas her response was ""I don't Know"". Finally after having my hours cut to 5 from the 15 I was getting (also told during Christmas my hours would go up, they remained at 10-15 while my other coworkers had to do 30 and we were short a person) because I reported her to another manager for her inappropriate behavior towards me I had to quit and find another job. All the coworkers I worked with have  said when it was brought up in conversation that She, my old manager, hated me. I was a great worker, loved working at a café but the managers made it a nightmare to want to go in. Also had been requesting to transfer to the back room, was told to stop asking. A month later a coworker who was hired after me and who was leaving in two months got transferred to the back room. When I asked a manager why it wasn't me he replied ""did you ask, and because he's great with the customers"". The back room doesn't involve customers, its receiving. I had been told to stop asking so they knew I wanted the position when they gave it away a month later. One other thing, don't do your coworkers work because they"
bad,with the reliance of eBooks and other such advances the company tried to stay in the game but the management couldn't adapt to sales volume levels decreasing drastically
bad,I was lied to on several occassions. The first incident was being told there was no dress then getting my hours cut for not obiding to the dress code. The second was being told I was not a temporary employee but I guess I was because I was let go for no reason. Lastly I was told it was a full time position with bi annual raises. I worked one 30 hour week then got cut to working 7 hours a week. I spoke with current employees who said the manager told them I was fired because I was not disrespecting my fellow coworkers to the managers. Also they told me thats how the managers schedule and keep employees. So if you like being lied to and competing to have better drama than your coworkers apply.
bad,"Seriously this job is horrible. The people are cruel and gossipy like a nasty group of teenage girls. They’re all horrible! But the job itself is fine. You get some vacation time which is cool. "
bad,"When I worked at the Bookie during the August student rush I enjoyed interacting with my fellow employees, however there was always an underlying tension since we knew that out of the 50 they had hired that they would only keep 12. We competed on the daily for the best compliments from customers, and it made it difficult to ask for help for fear that they might take the good review that could get you a job for the next year. At the end of the term they suddenly told people that they were no longer needed and were expected to leave. I felt this was incredibly rude as I felt they could have easily talk with each of us the week before to let us know if we were staying or leaving so we could start looking for the next job."
bad,The manager was inconsiderate most times. There is no respect and growth opportunities for members of the lower staff. Overall it was not a great experience working there.
bad,Barnes and Noble is a sinking ship and will eventually close its doors.  They fire senior staff members with no notice every year after the Christmas holidays.  They've been doing it for years.
bad,it is fine as a first job co workers become like family are allowed a decent discount hard not to buy books everyday reminded how a corporation treats its emploees
bad,"Great environment but it could be better, for example they need to hire more reliable people no one was able to cover one shift without having a lame excuse. Some of the management needs to be more considerate of their employees, they have to consider the fact that some of us are not going to be working for Barnes and Noble for ever and that we are not going to be making this a career so when we decide to call out for the day because we are so behind in school because you either over scheduled us, be more considerate and don't throw a fit or blame it on us. it is now our fault you're not doing your job by hiring more employees. Life happens and I want to advance in my career than to be behind."
bad,"Aside from the very understanding and Cooperative managers, the environment was absolutely cutthroat. Corporate demands trickled down and make even a part-time job extremely stressful at this place."
bad,"A shift at Barnes & Noble was typically relaxed and enjoyable. The hours were flexible, but the longer I worked there the more cuts there were. I was continuously given more responsibility within the workplace and cross-trained in all departments, but received no increase in pay."
bad,"When I started working there it was a fabulous place.  Unfortunately, upper management was more focused on sales and not on customer service and the stores fell into decline. It's very sad actually, I had been a wonderful place. I'm still friends with all my coworkers, even though we have all left, it was like one big family."
bad,"If you choose to work at Barnes and Noble DO NOT become anything but a bookseller or barista. Their version of a pay raise to become a lead is subpar and their pay raise to a manager is insulting. It doesn't matter how long you've worked there you are only anther body to the company and you are always replaceable. It could just be the Maplewood store or our district in general but loyalty means nothing to them. The managers do not want to do the store operation projects so they delegate it off to leads or booksellers and then get angry if you are tasking and not selling. If you are looking for a temporary minimum wage job Barnes will do the trick I guess, but don't stay for long."
bad,"Any given day you are doing the work of three people by yourself my personal experience is from being a Cafe Lead, I'm not entirely sure how the book floor is treated but the likelihood of you getting hired for book floor is very low. Since I took over as lead I have seen at least thirty employees come and go because of the terrible work conditions and stress of the cafe. The managers don't care about the cafe and it is almost impossible to get assistance when your alone ,which is almost all the time. The training is non existent I was there for a year and a half and never received my Cafe lead Training everything I learned I had to figure out for myself. As for management not all of them are bad I would say that out of the 6 we had there were 2 that actually did there job correctly.Hardest part of the job is just the stress and workflow mainly because your by yourself with no help during 100+ customer hours.I do not recommend this job to anyone unless you are for sure hired strictly for book floor salesman"
bad,"Here you get no training despite what they tell you, you have no advancement if you go to the dept vender relations. In this dept you are stuck in a bottomless pitt as you are the lowest lifeform possible. You get no respect and are yelled at by management like children. When you dont do things as they want you to do it you get a coaching memo as to where they put you in a room with the new people that are just hired to take over your position. I dealt with 30 accounts and I cleaned them up for all of the bookstores, people called me by name to help them out cause no one was listening to their needs. The hardest part of the job has to be hearing the bookstores begging gor help and you want to help them but your management tells you no. The hardest part of my job was trying to act like the slave they want you to be, while the most enjoyable part of the job was leaving. If you dont hit your goal of working on 5 accounts a day they tell you to come in on saturday as if mon-fri wasn't enough. Dont work here stay far away!!!"
bad,"Through Barnes & Noble I have learned how to lead a team. I have learned the value of communication within the team. Most days that are slow are filled with enough day to day tasks to still make the work day fly by. I have learned how to merchandise, stock, replenish."
bad,"B&N Business Development Managers across the country are experiencing an unfortunate downhill slide in the stability of their positions, due to unrealistic expectations for retail sales in an ever-evolving competitive market. This is no longer a company to grow with, and as a representative of one’s community, it is damaging to credibility and professionalism to remain on a team that lacks the resources to support volume order sales and in-store events. Being part of a management team that has neither time nor ideas for collaboration is a sure ticket to failure. Caution prospective job seekers: This Titanic is about to sink!"
bad,"Would have been wonderful with good management and better response from corporate. Too bad it stopped being a bookstore and wasted space selling toys, games, and shoddy gift items."
bad,"Management would have no problem going behind your back and cutting your hours if you had an altercation with them. Little to no respect from management. Don't get me wrong there were definitely some amazing managers who I worked with, but the other awful ones left a mark and made me dread every shift. To the point where I would feel worthless and not even part of their ""team""."
bad,The Bookstores are a dinosaur almost extinct.  Hence venturing into this industry is not for the long run.  Beware of turnover rate thru the roof in the office setting
bad,"I just want to be quick here. "
bad,"The GM promised me 25+ hours a week and I ended up with 8 hours when I finally quit.  Assistant mgr was horrible, and would reprimand the staff in front of customers.   The mgt expected staff to clean as well as sell products, there was no cleaning service and the vaccum left black streaks on the carpet that the staff was expected to clean.  Dont take a job there!"
bad,Working at Barnes and Noble was somewhat stressful. It is a very fast-paced job and requires employees to be very strong willed due to the numerous complicated customers. Great for Customer service resume build
bad,"Did a REALLY good job there. Got pregnant, had maternity health reasons, they let me go. Said I could reapply when I felt better. The job I had is not open anymore."
bad,"Horrible hours. Horrible management. Horrible experience. Horrible coworkers. Just a terrible experience. Management was mean! Coworkers were catty. I love books, but that store has nothing to do with books, just numbers."
bad,"I'm certain that Barnes and Noble is an ok company to work for when you are in management, but being on the bottom end of the company really sucked. There were never enough hours."
bad,CTO is outsourcing and laying off.  Remaining employees becoming broken with workload and 24x7 schedule.   They are not in software business and phasing it out.
bad,"They don't pay well, but the atmosphere was pretty chill if you don't mind getting paid next to nothing. You have to harass customers to sign up for a discount program."
bad,No room to grow and poor management. Management is not efficient. All employees are underpaid and there are no set training guidelines. Work environment is very stressful.
bad,"Barnes and Noble has some great people within the stores, but the cooperate culture is toxic and hostile. I've seen several people with nearly a decade of experience at the company be pushed out because paying their salary was no longer ""cost-effective."" This is not a company that will make any real effort for the day-in-day-out employees, and they most definitely view anyone working there as expendable."
bad,"Boring. Hard to work for them. Too busy. They didn't have enough time for you, and you definitely weren't a priority. Boring Wouldn't recommend it to anybody."
bad,"The company did not want to pay me for my assignments. There was always a story about the bank every week and at times, I was still owed money from weeks before. This company had major issues with their business management skills."
bad,"If you have nothing nice to say about something, don't say anything."
bad,Just could not work retail hours for any more years with small children at home. No set schedule and working more weekends and nights than not.
bad,"Hours are inconsistent and there is no set schedule. Current Manager and one of the Assistant managers have major issues staying professional. They talk bad about employees behind their backs and anything told to them in private always makes it out to the other employees. They act unprofessional in front of customers and usually allow their emotions to run free rather than act like real managers. I was given a majority of the responsibilities of a department, but received no raise or title change, yet i get yelled at over things not happening when i am the only one there. One ASM has run off multiple employees."
bad,"The company is on its way out. I give it 2 more years tops before they file for bankrupcy. They are constantly operating on a skeleton crew, there are not enough people to help all the customers, do the projects and keep product on the shelves. Not to mention dumb corporate policies being handed down every month that only makes things harder."
bad,Not a great place. Wouldn't recommend it to people who would want to work here. Pay isn't good and people working with are not that great. Very bossy.
bad,"it is great opportunity for learning customer relations and personal contact between seller/customer. knowledge of world events thru books , electronically devices such as Nook, multi tasking efficiency, merchandising, stock ordering, cashiering. overall grea experience"
bad,"on your feet all day. typical problems you find in a mall, security issues like stealing, pedophiles, and stalkers. abusive customers who are treated like they are the victims. cleaning up diapers and bodily fluids in the children's section."
bad,"good place to work,review process flawed,understaffed at times,typical retail tasks and dealing with needy people"
bad,"My experience working at B&N was horrible for the most part. I met a few people that I am still friends with today, but besides that, nothing good came out of this job. The only reason that this even got 2 stars is because of the people that made the job better. "
bad,I would not suggest working for Barnes and Noble. The management was terrible and they did not know how to treat their customers with any kind of respect. Plus they are going out of business so many loyal employees lost their jobs in this change; there was no sense of job security. You could lose your job at anytime; plus the pay was not worth the amount of extra work that was asked to put in.
bad,Management is only getting worse at Barnes and Noble my mangers all disliked the head manager and general manger. After I had an unexpected medical leave I was treated so poorly trying to come back to work to the point I asked to transfer. After trying to transfer I kept receiving poor treatment from my managers and GM and even Barnes and Noble HR and Benefits who won’t call me or return my phone calls. They will however send letters telling you to call but again they won’t answer your calls or messages. The customers are so amazing and I love them and I adore my co workers and the job itself but when managers treat you so poorly as does everyone at the top it’s very hard to get anywhere. I’ll be honest I’m a book lover as are most Barnes and Noble Employees but I don’t think I will be doing business with Barnes and noble from here on out. It’s so sad to see something you love treat you so poorly and treat others just as poorly. I hadn’t my head manager hang up on me after I was in ther Emergency Room right before my medical leave. It’s very sad to be treated this way by someone you’ve done nothing but try to please for months. It’s even worse to have HR do nothing even after complaints from so many people.
bad,so demanding and too much work not worth minimum wage!!! management is very demanding and expect too much and disregard the fact that you’re simply a minimum waged employee!
bad,Company relies on antiquated systems to maintain small profit margin in a world that relies on technology. Company lays off often to compensate for lost of profitability.
bad,worked in a very diverse area with In a part of the city that never sleeps.  job was surrounded by different train and bus stations which makes it easy to get to.
bad,"Decent job if you can avoid becoming too involved and can ignore constant nagging. Avoid management positions and anything long-term. B&N won't be around much longer and has a history of mass lay-offs.  Nowadays, it's more like working in a toy store anyway and it will leave you depressed and bitter."
bad,overall a disappointing experience. there are two managers that are never organized and don't value employees. one of them is very lazy and very rude to many employees
bad,They would add a new policy or new way to do something every single week to the point when i first started its not even close to what it was and if anything its starting to really hurt and cause way to much stress when you come back from days off and everything has changed again. And this is a sales job only for MEMBER SHIPS if your great at selling them then you will do fine but if your planing on book selling this is not the job for you find a different bookstore.
bad,"When promoted after 2 years I was given a 40 hour per week position; but forced to leave early twice a week. Management was poor, and workers suffered."
bad,"It's sad to see a company make so much money, yet pay their employees horribly. The employees DO NOT benefit from this company. "
bad,Except for rush when class begins each semester work is usually slow.
bad,"Barnes and Noble was a typical retail position. Very few days off, if any."
bad,"This store location had a lot of people working very few hours to avoid paying benefits. Employee moral was low overall, and most seemed miserable to some degree. Management was ruthless and unprofessional. I was advised to work off the clock, which I learned was illegal shortly thereafter. The demise of the publishing industry is evident. Minimum wage."
bad,"At my location, the management doesn’t care about the needs and availability of its employees. I am a student and they do have me working before/after school. But I work long hours into the night and I have way more hours than promised when school began. When asked for less hours and closing shifts, mgmt gave me more hours and changed two of my shifts. My grades are suffering but I cannot afford to quit, lest I lose my apartment."
bad,Two words: SECRET SHOPPERS! Hated having to worry about using specific lingo to help customers in order to receive a good shop. They fired 1800+ booksellers because they didn’t want to pay for their benefits. You have to sell memberships which can be a hassle. Most times you can’t convince someone to purchase a 25 dollar membership that basically covers tax (10%). My coworkers were the best. District managers not so much
bad,"I’ll keep this short and identify the top reasons B&N is an unfair work environment. 1.)They do not pay accordingly. 2.)They will continue to hire new employees in order to avoid paying current employees (that have the availability and experience) for full-time/let them receive benefits. 3.)Many of my peers have open schedules, but they would rather ration hours. 4.)They are invasive and pushy when it comes to customer privacy. 5.)They don’t provide proper training. 6.)They have taken advantage of employees by giving them a workload they are not trained for and will not pay according to the designated pay rate for the job."
bad,Was a wonderful company to work for years ago but not anymore. Managers a tough and two faced. Most customers are great but demanding. Glad I got out when I did. Was there a long time and was stressed everyday.
bad,The management at Barnes and Noble cares more about making money than they care about their employees. There were weeks that I was berated to tears every single day by one of the managers when I was doing what one of the other managers had told me to do. They like gossip more than anything else and if you're traditionally pretty you can get away with breaking the dress code and not doing your job well. And when customers get abusive management is more likely to take their side than yours even if the customer is not complaining for a justifiable reason.
bad,"Once upon a time I was proud to shop at Barnes and Noble. It was the big local bookstore that had all the awesome new novels I cared about, and I really loved it. When I got a job at Barnes and Noble I was shocked at how quickly I was hired, but was a bit confused when it was my interviewer who was 20 minutes late to our interview in our own store. Now I know why."
bad,The management was horrible. The schedules were always changed and never informed. Manager was talking to employees about other employees. The head manager had no respect.
bad,This company is at deaths door. They are not a place where you can plan for the future. The business model has undoubtedly ensured the company will be closing more stores.
bad,"I was hired as the cafe supervisor and promised opportunity for advancement; the manager quit, so having only been there about 2 weeks, I had to do his job and mine for the same pay and was still being trained myself, by the employees I was supposed to be overseeing. Management was disrespectful and condescending and I consistently got scheduled to close and then open the next day. "
bad,"Worked for the company for 16 years. Unfortunately, politics and nepotism that occurred in the area kept me from moving to a store closer to home. Upper management in the area is completely awful."
bad,"Shot themselves in the foot. After they stopped being book focused and spread out into tangential areas, they completely lost the objectives of why they were a book store."
bad,"The current workplace culture at Barnes & Noble is exceptionally strained and stressful. The company has undergone several changes in CEOs as well as changes in the executive management level. The company has struggled with its identity a specialty retailer as well as its position in the retail market. Earlier this year, Barnes & Noble executed a staff reduction of approximately 1800 personnel, all of which were department heads, including staff who were responsible for key areas of operations of the daily operations of the store. A typical day of work as a manager includes being directly responsible for all facets of operating a large retail operation. Upper-level senior management has provided little support or resources necessary for the continued growth and prosperity of the company, resulting in a turnover rate on all levels of not previously experienced in the company. The most difficult part of the job is attempting to execute company initiatives for increased sales and an outstanding customer experience with limited resources, direction and vision. Conversely, the most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with customers and the booksellers, driving sales, effective merchandising. Among some of the things I have learned is that both individuals and organizations alike need to anticipate and respond to changes in that marketplace and make strategic changes in order to capitalize on and succeed in a competitive environment."
bad,A lot has changed at Barnes & Noble since I was hired. It is no longer the company that I started with. Some of the changes have created a trickle down toxic environment.
bad,Barnes and Nobles was not looking to hire outside. They only look to hire inside the company and will find way to let you go to only promote within. This is true from district mgr to General Managers
bad,It's very fast-paced in the beginning when every student needs textbooks and then gets slower-paced throughout the rest of the semester. Management was very passive aggressive. Hours weren't scheduled fairly. Liked the coworkers and the discount.
bad,And I'm demanding job that affords you the opportunity to stay current on new releases. Hours vary and the pay isn't great but the friends you make with like-minded Book Lovers is invaluable if you consider literature a big part of your life and interests
bad,"They care more about your availability than whether you know anything about books. We never talk about books, no one has any product knowledge. It is very unfortunate because there are some of us who are passionate about the products that we sell but that is not a priority."
bad,"Ultimately great place for helping customers and great co-workers but the culture is built for people with no aspiration for upward mobility. . praise is rare . and criticism is quick .   The company seems to be having an identity crisis and toys are more of the focus, the problem is that getting more of what you sell well is difficult. time management for  replenishment is a challenge. as directions from upper mgmt conflict with the needs of the individual store."
bad,"The primary focus of Barnes and Noble as a retailer is to sell very overpriced memberships. You are expected as an employee in any capacity to sell more memberships than is reasonable. The membership is $25 for a year, and you get a 10% discount on future purchases with that membership. That means you would have to spend $250 dollars on books in a year to break even on the purchase of that membership. It's absurd."
bad,"Management was awful, the employees were miserable, the breaks were a joke, and no one was happy to be there. "
bad,"Unorganized, immature management. The discount was great but not worth it. I was in a serious car crash and the store manager was on my case about calling out of work that day (I was only scheduled for 3 hours). The main person who taught me was rude."
bad,"The typical day at work changed often. It often consisted of helping students find books and checking them out at the register. I learned some skills on the job, however I taught them to myself. Management was inconsistent and poor. The hardest part of the job was the atmosphere and management. "
bad,"high stressful env, with a toxic manager.No chances for promotions or progression.Ive learned how to work hard and efficent in a fast pace env and high stressful situtations,hardest part of the job is getting over 2000 online orders in a week during our rush,Most enjoyable part of the job is my costumers satisfaction."
bad,"I would not recommend this job to anyone I know. In the time I've been working, my availability has not been worked with despite my continued attempts to communicate with management to fix the schedule mishaps. I've had multiple work attire violations over ""inappropriate"" clothing with little explanation on why aside from describing it as ""inappropriate."" The handbook does very little to illuminate what is ""appropriate"" and leads to confusion when no one will explain why they are giving you a violation. Very little training is provided and I was mostly thrown out onto the floor. Management stresses non-stop about selling memberships and showing customers that we aren't ""running out of business,"" but ignores the customers themselves. The store always has a cold atmosphere and customers constantly complain about being ignored or being harassed by all the questions that upper management pushes to be asked."
bad,Hard work for very low pay and little room for career advancement.
bad,"I loved working here on the holidays but was not shown my talent in the short time I was there. They gave us a booklet to work at each station and didn't follow through and just put you in any station they wanted and you stayed there till end of holidays. Work schedule was not flexible if going to school or another part time job. If can not work they deduct your hours slowly to get rid of you and they play favorites, mostly Caucasian men. "
bad,"Management ignores all gripes about shortcomings."
bad,"Otherwise this job will be terrible.  You get paid very little, unless you're management you aren't guaranteed very many hours and so your benefits get cut.  Super awesome way to treat your employees, B&N.  Unfortunately they have to do this because it seems this company won't be around for much longer."
bad,"The management (from corporate down) are terrible. The District Manager only speaks to the Store Manager, nobody else, the Store Manager is never at the store so neither of them knows what's going on. SM is only in store about 25 hours a week so his job falls on the Assistant Manager and the Assistant Managers job falls on everyone else. It's an awful working environment because its obvious that the DM and SM don't care, so why should us booksellers care? They complain that we don't have enough hours to run the store, but the SM not being there 20 of the hours that he is supposed to is what is wasting hours (he gets paid whether he is actually here or not)."
bad,"If you are a strong independent employee that likes to drive sales, this is NOT the place for you. A typical day consists of standing around talking to your coworkers and not actually working. This is what the management sets as the environment. Accountability is only used on employees that are not favored. If you follow the rules and speak your mind, you will be fired for doing the right thing. The District Manager is no better, they believe what the store manager tells them. This company needs to actually hire QUALIFIED employees to run correctly, starting with management. They need to spend more focus on the customer instead of other employees."
bad,"By far the worst place I've ever worked. Managers made me feel like an idiot for asking the smallest question or making the smallest mistake, and a vast majority of the managers never even bothered to engage in conversation with me or acknowledge my existence- except when giving me directions or reprimanding me."
bad,"The bookseller job is only good if you have extensive knowledge of authors and where all the merchandise is in the store. There is one brief learning session but you’re required to memorize everything on your own. Which is hard when they make you the only person on register; and you can’t leave your post. You can do everything right at this job but they still won’t think you’re a good employee; and play favorites. Some are told they can’t get a certain job and have to work long and hard for it; while others get that job less than a week after being hired. Too much gossip and it is very unorganized as a whole. Information is not shared with the whole group and that often results in looking dumb in front of the customers. It’s not hard to see why people leave this company quickly, often without a trace."
bad,Legitimate concerns were brought to the attention of the management team and nothing was ever done. Many times it was said that nothing can be done. Although it was said in their own handbook that these things (safety and harassment) need to be brought to the the management team because they are there to help you.
bad,Salary and compensation way below what you should be making. No advancement possibilities. Overworked and understaffed. They are always saying they will promote you and it never happens
bad,I wanted to work in books. Took a job in cafe with the promise of being cross trained and never got cross trained. Multiple new book floor employees hired instead. Management was a total mess. My cafe manager and the store manager were always at odds. I was constantly closing my self. The cafe manager wanted a perfect closr and the store manager wanted to leave 40 minutes before we were scheduled. I was always getting berated by one of them because i could not do both. I stayed about 9 months and then found something worth my rime. Will never go back. I havent not been in a barnes and noble since then.
bad,"I understand that companies need to stay in business, but they should still care about what they are selling.  I feel that B&N stopped caring about books some time ago.  "
bad,You get what you pay for. Work is not difficult although sometimes long and tedious. Management doesn't care about you at all. Pay is laughable. Advancement is very competitive and doesn't come with significant pay benefits.
bad,"Working for Barnes and Nobles can be a good or a bad experience depending on the day. I learned how to make great lattes because of this company. The hardest days could be, when your employees are not cooperate with you.  Also when customers are being awful with no reasoning. Lastly the best times are, making great sales and margins."
bad,"Give this rate because at the first days was awesome, but then"
bad,"When I worked at the Barnes and Nobel Cafe, there were lots of issues working with the girls within the cafe. One of them acted as if she was the supervisor, making our job hellish. She told me that if I didn't do my job right, I would get my hours cut by upper management over ONE mistake. Not only that, but the employees played the blame game on each other, which happened to be me and one of the newest leads that transferred in from California called them out on that when one girl tried saying I didn't switch out the sauces when my supervisor watched me do it the night before. The cafe manager was a big cry baby and was never at work, and with the leads, she made their work life terrible by basically adding all the work load onto them. You get paid once a week, so If you're looking for a second job, with a little bit more income, this would be it. But be prepared to be treated like garbage. Other than that, the discounts were great, and the events we had for Harry Potter or for Batman were amazing and fun."
bad,There were some great people I worked with and two managers I loved so much we’re still friends to this day. The rest of it? Not worth getting out of bed for. The company as a whole has been in a death spiral for years and it’s only getting worse from what I can tell. Upper management doesn’t have a clue what they’re doing. They literally did all of the wrong things. It was mind boggling! The people in the stores try to tell them what we need and they do the opposite. They do everything they can to pay as little as they can which loses them good employees.
bad,"Desant company to for work,  salary employees are expected to work longer hours, not many kick backs for losing time from home, weekends are not weekends"
bad,"The typical day would be coming to work, either in the morning (8 am-4 pm) or night (2 pm-10 pm).  The day was extremely fast-paced with little time to relax before the next wave of customers came in.  We were typically working by ourselves, which was stressful considering that we had to deal with inside of the store plus the window that opens to the mall.  We also had to be worried about following health codes so everything had to be cleaned and replaced pretty often.  One of the most frustrating things was closing the store at night.  You were left with a multitude of things to do in only one hour, leading to us not being done until 10:30 or 11 at night.  This, and the fact that there were hour cuts with all of our employees led me to quit this job and pursue an easier career."
bad,"High expectations on part time employees (and everyone is part time), more work than time to do it, horrible training, bad morale, stressful. There is incredible pressure to sell over priced memberships which customers are sick of hearing about. Left alone to do the job almost right away with little training from an outdated book.  They  get mad when you limit your availability but they only offer 20 hours and no benefits so how are people to live unless they have another job?"
bad,"Barnes and Noble was a great place to work at first, but soon realized they lack opportunity for career advancements and raises happen annually at only 25 cents being the most for ""exceeding company expectations"". Management cares more about company quotas than employees well being."
bad,Everything  is fake. Nothing is really fair everyone has there own master plan. I feel like they are going down hill and don't want to say it. It's a same
bad,Over the past several years I have seen a shift in the culture of Barnes & Noble. They care about the bottom line but don't really seem to care about the employees or customers. It is stressful trying to maintain a standard when the management doesn't give us the tools to succeed.
bad,"If you are in college it is okay. They do work around your schedule. The pay is not great. It is a quick pace, non stop environment. You have to pretty much know just about everything in the store."
bad,"The general manager at my particular store was a nightmare. I called out during a morning with dangerous weather and as punishment she took me off the schedule for the rest of the week. Once my car (a big van) windows were covered in ice and she told me to stand outside in 30 degree weather and scrape the ice off with a credit card. I'm a true Floridian and that just wont fly, it's not my responsibility to ensure you've scheduled enough coverage in case someone calls out."
bad,"While the assumption about working at Barnes & Noble is positively associated with working around books, the fact remains that it is just another retail job. Generally, you feel as if you are putting a lot more effort into your work than you are getting paid for, and numbers and sales are the only thing that matter to the company."
bad,"it was a lot of work, not worth waking up at 5 am for chump change, management is horrible, co-workers are lethargic and un-enthusiastic, no motivation to come to work"
bad,"Barnes and Noble has a more inviting presence than most stores, The store has not updated its technology in many years. It can not compete with retailers who are more tech savy."
bad,"It is better to work for the store if you are in a large city, but not in a small town.  You can receive more benefits (i.e. longer breaks, greater opportunity for advancement) if you work in a major metropolis."
bad,"Working as a cashier gave valuable skills in customer service and sales of barnes & noble memberships. However training was minimal and there was varying policy among management about when to push front shelf items (line rush, etc). Little variation in work and responsibility"
bad,"I loved working with the books and the customers who had a genuine interest in reading. However, management was horribly biased from store management to regional management. Training was very unorganized and it felt as though we received no support from our higher ups. If we did not meet the unrealistic membership sales,it would be impossible to move up or receive any sort of raise, despite time with the company and other work performance."
bad,I held the position of a cashier in which I ensured that each customer's transaction was completed in a timely manner and were provided with excellent customer service
bad,"Not enough hours whatsoever. They were also understaffed in the cafe area. Most shifts, you end up working completely on your own which I fine is unfair."
bad,"For those working for minimum wage, it's not the fun coffee house bookshop you're thinking of. It's not a lot of work, mostly boring, and not a great place to shine as far as customer service. They do hire within, which is great, but it's not as easy to move forward."
bad,"Management deliberately took away my benefits/sick days that I had already accrued as a full time employee after slashing my hours down to below part-time subsistence levels.  The joke is on them because I am far too evolved to work in retail again.  "
bad,Management for this company is manipulative and only looking to secure bonuses for themselves.  They take advantage of their employees and do not compensate for the work you do.
bad,"I had been working for the contract company before being transferred to the Barnes and Noble account. Sandisk, the job was great, stressful in the parts it should have been and rewarding in the parts it should have been. That's before inside scams and so forth began to birth themselves within management of the account with no accordance to the contract."
bad,The management was really difficult here. They each seemed to be on a power trip and were unfriendly. I would not work at a Barnes and Noble again.
bad,"Do not work at the Southlake Store! It’s safe to say that it’s an on-fire trash can. Three out of the five managers are either completely rude, incompetent, or horrible micromanagers. They expect employees to complete 300% of the work with a quarter of the time. Sick? Dead? Don’t count on any sympathy from the GM. For example, an employee needed to go to a funeral and management expected them to find people to cover their shifts. Benefits are non-existent for part-time employees, except for the 40% off. discount The other employees are fantastic and could easily run the store with little help. Training is “learn-as-you-go.” Again, the employees and one of the managers are fantastic, extremely supportive, and know how to act as a team to get the job done. Customers are a mixed bag. Some are great and some are, well, consider the location."
bad,"Montgomeryville Pa location was super fun to work at. Management was kind and thorough. Paid fairly and safe environment to work in. The Jacksonville NC location had terrible management. Training was harsh, and management were mean and all over the place."
bad,"I loved working there in the beginning. Super positive vibe, great coworkers. Its an easy job. But the company struggles with what it wants to be. And the amount of miscommunication and monthly focus on what to upset or promote was exhausting. The obsessions with the company and managers to sell membership cards is something that to the extend with get you a bad performance review and possibly terminated. Something that you shouldn't have to work, since the job is an hourly job and not based off commission for a card that 90% of the customers who come in don't want to spend $25 a year on to save $.70. They put more value on that, then how well you work with others, customers, the recommendations you give and your customer service. You can sell a hundred books, and redo an entire section of the store with promotions, but if you didn't sell 20 memberships, you failed. It became a very negative and stressful environment to be around. And the managers became extremely distant, cold and unapproachable."
bad,"They book you every possible day you're available. Extremely low pay. Not really any raises or advancements unless you're there 5+ years. The Cafè was the worst part. Extremely mismanaged, one closer for the WHOLE Cafè, and you get crapped on by the entire staff if you miss one thing during closing (even though you're the only person closing WHILE customers are still coming up to you and ordering food and drinks). Not to mention the managers don't care much about the cleanliness unless it impacts business, so the fridges are absolutely disgusting, with old milk spills in all the little cracks. Not a good place to work unless you enjoy low pay and a lack of benefits, besides an employee discount (that doesn't help much considering new books there are $20+ EACH)."
bad,You could be scheduled  for an 8 hour shift but if they don't need you they can send you home after 2. Seniority doesn't play much of a part for who gets hours unless you are manager. It seems that they feel that all employees are replaceable.
bad,"I just quit the other day because I couldn’t stand being put down for impossible sales goals and belittled over the smallest thing by a store manager who knew nothing about the food industry. I was in cafe and used to love my job. Almost everyone since I started 9 months ago has quit, usually by ghosting, as they fear being treated badly should they give notice. It’s very toxic. Would often find baristas crying in the freezer. Wouldn’t recommend."
bad,"easy work but very robotic. just open boxes and stack shelves 8 hours a day."
bad,"My time at Barnes and Noble was a mixed bag.  I enjoyed being around books and coffee and nerding out with fellow staff and customers, but the rest was not good.  The pay is pitifully low, without even legitimate raises (pay bumps because minimum wage went up should not count...), and the manager was horrible!  She was the main reason I left, besides the pay.  She was controlling, manipulative, and micromanaging.  She stressed everyone out, and the atmosphere was just awful.  She had favorites and would bully the staff members that she didn't like.  No one wanted to be there when she was there.  Also, the hours were really inconsistent.  One week I would have 15-20, then the next only 8, and some weeks, none at all.  It was impossible to budget.  I would not recommend this place to anyone, especially since the company recently axed over fifteen hundred employees.  Not a good sign."
bad,"I am a seasonal employee at B&N and am really disappointed at the lack of training.  When I worked at Macy*s, we were trained on registers off floor; when we stepped onto the floor we knew exactly what to do.  B&N puts you on the floor and expects other employees to help you out, which they were generous in doing.  But the lack of formal training disturbed me.  Information is thrown at you in bits and pieces.  It is unprofessional to have untrained staff learning at the expense of the customer. And there was no cohesion in management in instituting store policies.  One manager says don't call customers after 8PM another says call after 8PM; one manager says leave at 12:00AM another manager says help clean the cafe BEFORE you leave.  I cannot wait for the season to be over!"
bad,"Barnes and Noble was once a great place to work! Not anymore. It’s gone from being a bookstore with heart, to a company that doesn’t  care about its employees. They won’t hire any full time employees anymore because they don’t want to have to pay benefits. They believe they are going to save themselves 40 million dollars by doing this.  The only thing that this will do for them is keep them afloat for a little longer. "
bad,"I loved my job, and my customers, but I had to leave. The environment was increasingly toxic, none of my managers liked each other, and there was constant harassment and verbal abuse. They wanted me to do managerial work for no extra pay, and when I turned them down, they cut my hours and refused to treat me with any respect. Reporting harassment to any of the managers, including our district manager, did nothing. In fact, the harassment of me and my coworkers got worse to the point that most of our experienced staff have already left. They don't train new people completely anymore, since they expect them all to quit months later (rightfully so), and they belittle anyone who asks too many questions. It's really unfortunate, since the job itself, the books, and the customers of my store were fantastic. Bookstores aren't really dying because of ebooks. They're dying because the company isn't treating booksellers well anymore."
bad,"I began my three year tenure at B&N and absolutely LOVED the first 2 years. I was hired externally for the new café lead position and worked closely with the café manager up until her sudden departure. Being most suited at the time for the position, I applied for, interviewed and received a promotion for Café Manager! It was super exciting and started off really well. However, because of the sudden state of our café after the previous café manager's leave, I did not receive the usual café manager training where I would have trained for my managerial position within another store. Down the road, that severely impacted my ability to execute my manager duties effectively. I did not receive any training in business acumen whatsoever and everything with the systems that I did learn was self taught by poking around when I had a free moment. I was also scheduled as a member of staff, not as a manager overseeing my department, which made it excessively difficult to see to my managerial duties. The store manager was adept at the operation of the bookfloor, but regarding matters in the café, she did not understand the scrope and did not provide helpful feedback. Often times her criticisms were harsh and belittling."
bad,I am very much unappreciated for the work I do and am looking to leave as soon as possible. The job can be disgusting at times and there is no appreciation for that either
bad,"The job was okay. As a temporary job, I had a month of time to just walk around 7 to 8 hours a day with no time to sit and being in pain from all the constant walking and bending. '"
bad,"It's not the worst job that exists, but it's difficult, and the pay and compensation were sub-par considering the amount of work we put in on a daily basis. There was an incredible amount of micromanaging and very little empathy from those in power, which isn't entirely surprising given the size of the Barnes and Noble chain. "
bad,"You can be highly knowledgeable about every aspect of the store without being promoted. It was a complete waste of time as one watched individuals consistently coming in from the outside who knew nothing about the culture or the product. It is a great place if you want to remain stagnant without any real explanation as you why you are stuck. Forget about moving anywhere unless you can push the membership program. You can also forget about making a living wage with this company. It is the love of the books that keep most employees in the door. However, upper leadership has no clue about the culture of books and set forth customer-alienating policies that harm what Barnes and Noble is about."
bad,"Bookseller position may impart good work skills for those starting out, but it will not help much for the college student hoping to pay the loans. Management was nice enough."
bad,"Typical day at work is greeting customers and making drinks."
bad,Job is easy. Co-workers are laid-back. Management is really poor. There is no opportunity for advancement. It can be a good place to work if certain managers were not present.
bad,"Corporate is always creating new initiatives and changes that cause the employees more stress and are not practical on a store-to-store level. Upper management is extremely hands off. Constantly understaffed. Less product is being carried, causing people to leave the store and head to Amazon instead."
bad,I worked for Barnes & Noble for many years. It was a wonderful company until 2015. Hours have been cut drastically and booksellers and managers are being made to do the work of three. There is no positivity to be found now. Every morning and every evening we were  berated with how badly we had been doing and how there was no way we could improve. I suggest looking anywhere else if you want some positive vibes in your life. This company let me down. The book business is looking better; I hope that B&N can turn things around and appreciate the great staff they still have!
bad,The store manager that I worked for was the worst manager I have ever known. She always had to make sure she knew who to blame for anything. She created a terrible store culture . People were afraid to talk to each other .  Employees were leaving at an extremely high rate. One person even walked off the job after a month
bad,"I learned a lot here about retail, but that was about it there really wasn't a lot of advancement. They do teach you and keep you updated on making the beverages, but thats about all you will learn."
bad,"I threw my back out twice working here. This place works you to the core and is probably the best workout you'll ever get. Only down part about that is, it'll also drive you insane. Between co-workers ignoring you when you need help, and managment having you do 10 things at once, including help the customers, you'll be lucky if all you get to do is hide behind a register all day."
bad,"Typical day consisted of greeting customers, assisting them with purchase decisions, and check-out! Didn't really work at this job long enough to get a feel for management, but it was a very friendly and professional work enviornment."
bad,"Yes I was approached to take on more responsibility , work"
bad,"In a typical day at work, anything could happen. I have learned a great deal about customer service that has built into my skills and ability to deal handle different situations as they arise."
bad,"Teaming can be a challenge, booksellers are fairly passionate about the products. The most enjoyable part about the job is the customers and access to books. The hardest part is how the job is undervalues and the low pay unless you are a store manager or above. Has potential but its lacks. The nook is the best they have going."
bad,"Our current location is run ineffectively.  It does a lot if business, so I dont think its looked at other than a money maker"
bad,"This company is very outdated and has a dinosaur IT infrastructure, using old technology and many people don’t know how to use it properly. Lots of processes are broken, the so-called manager doesn’t know how to manage and plays favoritism while bashing other managers or employees to his subordinates. Completely unprofessional. There is a high degree of favoritism, whispering and unnecessary high school drama. cursing, gossiping, no one says good morning or good night, it’s so negative you will leave there each day wanting to jump off a bridge. Found a much better job, goodbye and good riddance!"
bad,"Mostly Spanish working there in every department. Your supervisor your leads all speak Spanish and when you train in your department it will be a Spanish speaking person that doesn’t speak very good English even though she told me she has worked there 15 years and had to ask me how to say stairs as she pointed at it to teach me how to climb the stairs to go over the conveyor belt. They move you to different departments and a new Spanish speaking person will attempt to teach you how to do the work. This was a difficult place to work because of the huge language barrier, I really couldn’t talk to anyone most of the day because hardly anyone spoke English. I lasted 1 week and quit. So if you speak Spanish you will love this job it’s pretty easy. It definitely is warm in there, so wear comfortable thin t-shirts."
bad,Working environment good but compensation is horrible with raises that are laughable. good part time job for a person who doesn't need to make any real money
bad,"This company was not my favorite by any means. The cooperate structure was very strict and some of  the management team was sexiest, The customer basis was easy to handle."
bad,My personal experience with Barnes & Noble was awful. I was never formally trained and was just thrown to the wolves. I did much more work than was reasonable for the little compensation o received. I was also promised full time and received 12 hours a week instead.
bad,"having spent the past 20 years avoiding the threat of Amazon, B&N is scrambling to figure out how to survive.  Management is overworked and overstressed.  Staff is micromanaged.  Compensation is lower than fast food jobs."
bad,Managing is the biggest problem here. Manager dont communicate with one another and tell workers all different things. A manager of mine also didnt listen to any employees about any opinions on how to make things easier or when they're having issues with organization. They also dont take the time to train employees and expect them to figure it out or for other workers to help them when they need it at all times.
bad,"I came out of retirement to work for $10.25 per hour. I figured it would give me something enjoyable to do but instead I found it stressful and poorly managed. "
bad,"I work at a mall location as a shelver and the expectations for what I need to get done are ridiculous. Anytime I try to explain that I couldn’t shelve within the time frame they expect because I needed to shift books around, put them in overstock, stop to help a customer, scan through an entire section to make room etc they seem to ignore it or brush it off as if they aren’t legitimate reasons. Management varies in ‘quality’ but they all have a ‘corporate knows best’ attitude that gets annoying fast. Also, if I’m expected to shelve seven carts of books in four hours, sell a membership, greet every customer correctly, and cover for cashier breaks then why don’t you pay me more than 10 dollars an hour."
bad,My time here was short. I was hired as part time so I thought but the told me a few months later I was actually only hired as seasonal which was unfortunate for them but beneficially to me as I was puttig in for vacation time. It was harder than normal work for a bookstore and the manager was rude and monotone. Wouldn't reccomend.
bad,This company doesn't know anything about IT . Of course there technologies are all old and outdated . The description for this position is really misleading and based on this organization using old technologies . The use of some of the technologies presented  in the description aren't and will not be used . This company needs to close there stores and catch up on there work and technology before you bring those old dinosaurs out of the cave . Good for young up and coming IT student . Possibly good for a second job for an adult
bad,was okay job just temporary a lot of push to up sale customers all the time a lot of pressure to sell memberships that offer little benefits to costumers
bad,"The people who work at Barnes and Noble are great. Management not so great. Hours per week are inconsistent, and your annual raise is twenty-five cents. It is great if you are looking for part-time work while going to school."
bad,Unless you go to the school that the Barnes and Noble is in then you are very highly suggested to stay away.  terrible place to be at and terrible place to work and the perks are discounts on school supplies so unless you are still in school stay away
bad,"Was a great company and place to work but is now on a downward slide, unfortunately.  Focus is being lost, hours are cut, management has been poor. Poor corporate decisions are having an adverse impact at the local store level."
bad,No day is typical. Everyday is different. Customer focused company but lack or hours/staffing makes it difficult to tend to customers and complete tasks required daily. I have learned a lot about my ability to persevere and get the job done. Hardest part of my job is staying positive in the current situation of the company. Retaining staff and keeping people motivated is becoming increasingly more difficult.
bad,"It was great when I started 7 years ago. But the last 3 years were very hard in the company. Corporate wanted more work done with less people andnitnlead to very low employee morale. I was finally"
bad,"My coworkers and managers at my store were great and treated me well. However, when it came to corporate, they were constantly piling more impossible demands onto low level workers because their company is failing. Secret shoppers have become the biggest priority which leads to pressure on employees for overenthusiastic customer service that only alienates customers. Who wants to be asked if they need help by 10 different people? The concentration on memberships and email captures makes genuine interaction with customers feel strained. "
bad,A decent place to work and overall experience staff with little hiccups in knowing what to do. They were friendly and helpful willing to show me how to do my job along the way.
bad,"Getting a job at Barnes and Noble was something that I had wanted for many years.  When I finally got one, I was ecstatic. At first, it was a fun, fast paced environment to work in and I looked forward to going to work every day.  Within a few months, unfortunately, things changed.  More and more people are ordering their books on Amazon or other websites, and sales are drastically falling at the store level.  Because of this, stores are closing, people are getting laid off, and more and more responsibilities are being put upon the employees, but they are not being compensated, or really even thanked for it.  Hours are being cut, but you're still expected to get all of your work done in a shorter amount of time, in addition to the extra work you now must do because half of your work force was laid off.  Going into work every day not knowing if it's your last day is very stressful."
bad,"Barnes & Noble is not a stable place to work since they are laying off."
bad,This was a great place to work until Corp. decided to fire all seasoned full time staff.  they will only hire part time at min. wages from this point on.  The customer service of the stores went from great to barely there because of the lack of personal and experience.  I would have to say this is not a safe place to work right now due to the lack of job security.
bad,"I was happy to have a job at age 19 with only four months' prior retail experience. The coworkers were excellent to talk to, and the work was challenging, hectic, and moreover frustrating. Customers were never satisfied (and we honestly were not given the means to truly help them), and I quickly became cynical about my job like most of my coworkers. As the payroll budget was continually slashed, some departments lost their managers and fell into disrepair (i.e. Music, Digital). Management continually asked us to do more with less, but invariably something was left behind at each step. I seldom worked in the Digital department as per my title, but rather was asked to work in every other department of the store as a customer service bookseller. Yearly raises were meager, even for those with excellent performance. Most of the top Membership sellers left the company in search of other employment."
bad,"Barnes and Noble was a very difficult place to work at due to the poor management. They were inefficient and struggled to lead employees, often times taking advantage of good employees, and abusing their power."
bad,"It's not a bad company to work for, especially if you're seeking entry level work. There are quite a few young people who work there in management and you will not get a set schedule."
bad,I did not like working here at all. I did not make any money because they were not giving me enough hours. I had to deal with a lot of rude people and employers.
bad,work on an upcoming point of sale release or fix.  handle production issues. The hardest part of my job is knowing that there is zero flexibility for a single parent and being told by your boss that the hours are 9-5 and its a company policy but other departments including the one you work the closest with everyday allows their employees to be flexible with their hours and work from home when necessary.
bad,"The people there are really nice but can be sensitive at the same time. They can get flustered when things don't go there way but that might not always have to do with work, we're all human."
bad,"Most days go by quick, I've learned how to mess around with coffees and flavors, the management is okay at best. I love working with most of my co-workers, so that's great. The only hard part of the job is getting hours these days. The only enjoyable thing is when I work with someone I enjoy being around."
bad,Came into the job with high expectations. Unfortunately I wasn't enough of an avid reader to be able to fit in. Also the amount of up-selling is ridiculous.Customer interaction was nice and  the freedom to work on specific projects alone (when allowed) was also a perk.
bad,Worked at this location for many many years. benefits are good if you are full time otherwise I would avoid. Great co -workers and environment horrible management the store manager has no problem being extremely inappropriate making fun of employees for medical conditions/ pregnancy and HR just kicks it back to the district and store manager to handle which means retaliation against who called HR. Loved the store and most the people I worked with but can't recommend this job until management changes
bad,"Find place to work to make minimum wage, but raises are minimal and only yearly and it is difficult to advance. They offer free book borrowing for employees."
bad,"gain customer service skills"
bad,I feel badly speaking ill of the dead but the store I worked in was toxic.  It's probably a good thing that it no longer exists.
bad,"VERY little training.  No job security. Store management pushes membership sales and looks the other way re: dishonest methods used to convince customers into buying/renewing early. Managers ""coach"" employee performance on the sales floor with customers present. Don't sell enough memberships? Watch your hours disappear. That said, non-management coworkers mostly supportive of each other. Customers mainly nice."
bad,Winter Garden Management a nightmare to work for. You never know what mood they will be in. If you don't sell memberships your in trouble
bad,"As a cashier, the job was as one would expect. There was constant work, greeting and working with customers (not all with a cheery disposition), and handling of money. The work was good and the environment, while quick paced sometimes, was mostly very quiet. If shelving books, there was always plenty of walking and carrying heavy books and boxes. When on the main floor, one was constantly folding, restocking, and aiding customers if not behind the registers. As I enjoy working with people this was perfectly acceptable. Beyond the normal operations of the floor, if things were slow, things could become frustrating. We would be tasked to refold already folded merchandise. Even in moments wherein there weren't any customers (as they were all in class), we would fill already filled shelves and weren't allowed to relax off our feet for a moment. With 6 hour shifts, constant standing lead to profound weariness and fatigue. Which would have been acceptable except we were making minimum wage at the time which was roughly 7.25ph. And even after earning our store a perfect Customer Service rating from a secret shopper for the first time in years, appreciation never came in any form. Which I didn't expect, but it did break my heart that even after doing them this service (which was my usual way of helping customers)... I was still utterly expendable. But that is my own thought and feeling. Since then, I can't speak to how management operates or treats their employees, but I do hope they provide some semblance of employee morale recognition and appreciation for those employees who go above"
bad,"They say you will work in the cafe for your first 2 weeks, but if you're really good, they'll keep you in the cafe and won't train you on the book floor. Training for cafe is hectic because they are always busy and don't have time to give you the proper training. Majority of the hours are given to the booksellers so there can only be 2-3 people working in the cafe the whole day which is not enough."
bad,"This is a very standard retail type of job. The pay is generally barely above minimum wage with absolutely no room for meaningful advancement and bonuses . The typical day to day was making sales on the sales floor with Nook, books, or cafe products while maintaining company goals and expectations."
bad,"As someone with a passion for books I was disappointed to learn that Barnes and Noble didn't value employees with extensive literary knowledge. The management team didn't explain job expectations clearly and seemed to set my coworkers up for failure rather than success. Sales goals were solely based on membership sales instead of books.  I wish I could say I learned so etching on the job but anything I learned was through self development. "
bad,Barnes and Noble doesn't have much opportunity for vertical movement within the company.  I was promoted to lead status within my first year but was never offered a managers promotion. Managers are more or less shuffled from store to store which prevents non managers from actually getting into management positions  Hard work is not truly rewarded.  I received exceptional marks on all of my performance reviews and still was unable to get a managers position even after my stores had been vacated 3 times.
bad,this company is too ancient they need to update everything from technology to training
bad,A typical work day was going take calls and fix things that was shutdown.
bad,"Cleaned the store, moped the floor, wiped the windows, swiped the floor, cleaned the wallpaper and cleaned bathrooms."
bad,"Daily systems checks. Follow up on orders that have not been received yet. Reset user passwords and perform retraining on supervisors.Discuss up coming projects with my boss and come up with new ways for us to use old equipment to move forward."
bad,Wish they were more about their employees as far as respect goes.
bad,Its an enjoyable place to work. I find great satisfaction in helping the customers.
bad,No Value in their employees. Poor Management. No Advancement.
bad,"this job used to be really fun. then the company got sold and it was extremely rough on the employees. cafe is always understaffed and baristas are expected to do everything at once by themselves. and even with little to no hours paired with low pay, booksellers are constantly pressured to sell memberships. it’s just overall a draining, stressful work environment."
bad,Zero training all the company seems to care about is memberships and email capture no recognition or appreciation of employees or management at all during the time I've been here
bad,"I worked at the Greenville NC store.  The best benefit was the employee discount.  The manager of the store hated me for no reason and I was passed over for a job I was highly qualified for.  He ended up giving it to someone who wasn't qualified for it and then he never told me that he chose them until 3 weeks later when I had to ask him about it.  Management does not care about you at all, it doesn't matter how hard you work and the quality of work you do."
bad,"Really, Barnes and Noble isn’t a bad job. You get an alright discount and usually get your breaks/lunch. But, you can tell that all the company wants is money from customers. You have to constantly push a membership, that my manager was very keen on pushing, and it’s totally overpriced. Most of the coworkers are good though."
bad,Preferred to be out of store marketing at schools. Bookselling team at particular store were clique oriented and nasty to anyone who was not a part of the original set-up team. Assistant Managers and Cafe manager were negative and bullying even to the new manager that came in a few months prior to me. Previous Community Relations Manager was forced out by being bullied.UUnprofessional and lack of leadership.
bad,"Management, not just at my location but others as well have a real knack for getting in the way and over-complicating things. Corporate has uninspired ideas to get people through the door, they are so slow at adapting to the times and instead of doing better and making good decisions, they do layoffs to save money yet increase hours and responsibilities for employees without increase in pay or addition of a job title. "
bad,Normally working by myself in the cafe for over five hours with no help or anyone to come cover breaks. That not every establishment is not as good as they pitch it in the interview. Only one good manager here everyone else needs to be evaluated and shown all the wrong that they do. Having to work by myself and constantly cover others shifts because no one held the staff responsible for there actions. There are rare chances of happiness inside of this job that give you hope to come back the next day.
bad,"Not enough employees to balance out the demand, not enough pay to compensate what we do. Doesn’t challenge a person to do better, once you master your job, it’s a dead end. Management depends on you so much because there’s not enough shoes to fill but you’re paid too little to do more than your job title. Even a good worker with great work ethic can be drained doing a brainless job. What was most enjoyable were the regulars who’d come in and order  the same thing every time; they remember you and you remember them. Cafe baristas weren’t allowed to have a tip jar but could receive tip if given hand in hand"
bad,"When I worked there, it wasn't managed the best. Managers would complain about working there and sometimes would forget to give us a meeting not to mention there are a lot of employees made mistakes that went unpunished and without warning. The most enjoyable part of the day was leaving. As funny as that sounds, it's true. Sometimes we would be kept over an hour after we were supposed to clock out or because the manager on duty took a long time counting the money or the cafe wasn't finished cleaning up their section."
bad,Management was very messy. They didn't go through most things in training.  High stress poor communication. Usually come in and stack candy. Then stand at the cash register waiting for someone to come.
bad,"Due to being a retail job, Barnes & Noble found it hard to find employees that were competent and to retain employees that were.  There was minimal training provided and you were very sales driven in a declining market."
bad,"Coworkers were great, but the job is very stressful. Customers are often very set in their ways and pushy and management is extremely poor. Often times the management would step on each other's toes which would lead to confusion. Training is pretty much nonexistent but you are expected to be perfect regardless. I do not and would never recommend this company."
bad,the pay is very low and I only can recommend it as a second job. you can only be happy if you absolutely love books and do not rely on this job as main source of income.
bad,"B&N was my first job, and in the sense that it taught me what to expect from a retail environment, it was useful. Otherwise, the culture, the pressure, and the inconsistent message from corporate all contributed to a sense of apathy among the staff. I became good friends with many of my fellow employees and managers. They were generally people who shared a passion for reading that corporate manage to quash through its addiction to meeting (usually absurdly forecasted) sales numbers."
bad,A typical day at work starts off by being given a long list of tasks to take on by yourself with no help from managers or supervisors. Long hours of hauling boxes and books from one floor to the other. The atmosphere is not very friendly amongst the employees either.
bad,"Cut throat environment with lack of stability, leadership and direction from District Management to CEO. "
bad,"Unfortunately Barnes and Noble has lost a great deal of my respect in the last year. As far as job security is concerned don't trust it. After several months of being told that several positions were going to be removed from the company structure but that those of us in those positions had nothing to fear as they were all to be done through attrition, one morning we were all safe and the next 1,800 of us, all full-time and all supervisors were out of jobs. Between this and not being compensated adequately I would not recommend working at Barnes and Noble."
bad,"Payroll has been cut drastically resulting in less hours and staff. You can no longer get overtime and key leadership roles have been eliminated. The culture of the company has shifted to a very negative one, leaving employees feeling undervalued and overworked."
bad,"When i started at B&N, they supported a robust education program and were dedicated to community outreach.  the last two years of my tenure, they systematically dismantled those programs."
bad,It used to be a supportive and fun place to work. There is a culture in place now that encourages an exclusionary environment that does not support everyone equally.
bad,one person is required to do the job of many without the pay raise. it is difficult to move up to a management position and there are very few lead positions available.
bad,This isa very political job. New positions go by who they like. They watch you like you are going to steal something.  Talking is not allow while at your desk even thou it's done anyway. The systems sap ihas so many steps to complete an incident I've learned a lot at this job from sales audit  to processing gift cards accounting
bad,"Uninspiring job, company.  8 hours/day, 40 hours/week.  Company is trying to find a sales leader (like the Nook e-reader used to be) and is struggling."
bad,"My department changed my outlook on the company. my department was very unprofessional, elitest, and biased. they do not have a proper concept of any position unless it is upper level."
bad,A typical day is spending your day trying to up-sell the membership to every breathing thing that walks in the store. If you don't make memberships you don't matter to them.
bad,"Management is often absent and hiding in the back office, forcing booksellers to do the bulk of the work on the floor. Management is very focused on the membership program and if you don't sell a certain amount of them you get yelled at. If you don't list at least two benefits and hear two no's from the customer, you get yelled at. By yelling, I mean in front of everyone, in the middle of the store. It was an extremely unprofessional workplace. They never promoted from within, the turnover rate was very high, and as a general consensus most booksellers were pretty discontented at the store I worked at."
bad,A day here consisted of assisting the customer with their needs for the school semster and ensuring they get the correct books to futher their education.
bad,B&N is a great company to work for in that the people make the company. i've learned that to advance you must work 24/7 and show that you care about every aspect of the company even though it is not your area of speciality.
bad,At the bookstore you will meet so interesting people. They have many different cultures that attend Houston Community College at Barnes & Noble. My co-workers there are good people to work with and I have enjoyed working at the bookstore
bad,"I was hired as holiday help, and even though I was asked to stay on after the season, I declined. My manager was terrible with my on-the-job-training and I quickly grew to realize that no one got along.  There was a tangible animosity between the ""openers"" and the ""closers"" and even the older coworkers and the seasonal help."
bad,"It was fun for me to work on campus as the hours were very flexible and allowed to take classes in between work. But the pay was the absolute minimum and no job culture, you come, you work, you go."
bad,This job was great for pocket change...not worth it for long term employment.
bad,"Work was really boring, and they would work you long hours with no breaks"
bad,I worked here for a little longer than a month and I was very discouraged with the management here because it was horrible
bad,A typical day at work was getting the cafe ready which took an hour. The pay was VERY LOW for someone who had experience working in Starbucks I thought I'd get paid a bit more. Managers was very nice but the place was just boring we hardly got customers so I would stand there all day or actually find something to do. If its your 1st job then this job is for you to learn and prosper.
bad,"I liked working at Barnes and Noble, but management was awful and my hours were always low and detected at the last minute of the week not knowing my hours."
bad,A manager bullies employees into never taking time off even if they are part timers. The hours you get scheduled for can be crazy and stressful. Coworkers were cool but because it’s so understaffed you’re often working basically alone. Not worth the stress of working alone with little training just to be scolded by a manager that does nothing to help anything or anyone in the store. Some managers were cool but the bad ones really outweigh the good ones.
bad,"I worked for Barnes and Noble several years ago, and then last year in a different city. Both times, management proved to be the main factor in my leaving. Which is weird to say, because I was management myself.  "
bad,"This is an incredibly boring place to work and I'm surprised they haven't already gone out of business. If you don't mind watching the clock every day, then this is the place for you!"
bad,"When I began working this job, I loved it. Over time, though, became incredibly draining. The level of support from management decreased and became unreliable. I still love the company, and my coworkers. I even still think fondly of most of my former managers and think I would work for a different location but this just didn't have lasting potential."
bad,"Overall, I think that Barnes & Noble is a great entry level retail job for a part time employee. I enjoyed my time with the company for the most part until there was a change in Store Manager and I knew it was time for my exit. I will say that if you work hard and want to be promoted from within, the company (depending on management team at your store) will help guide you up the ladder. I was promoted within from Receiving Manager to Merchandise Manager and from Merchandise Manager to Assistant Store Manager in 4 years. "
bad,"I worked here for 3 years in the cafe. I made some wonderful friends, and I loved most of the managers (the ones I didn't love...well, I'm going to be polite and not say anything about them at all)."
bad,"I luckily left before things started to get very terrible and my position was eliminated.  Don't start a career at Barnes and Noble .  Corporate is gutting the stores and leaving them with bare-bones crews, creating a very stressful work environment."
bad,"While this job isn't really that difficult, it's outstandingly stressful due to the lack of proper leadership. Management is very shortsighted and will never accept any responsibility for the things they do."
bad,"Barnes and Noble is a sinking ship. The company can't compete with Amazon, and it's going under fast. Because of this, I, along with all the other full-timers in the store, except for the managers, showed up to work one Monday morning to find out we were all being summarily laid-off, because we were part of an ""outdated business model"". In reality, our benefits were just too expensive. The company gave us no warning whatsoever, and while I understand that Barnes and Noble simply can't keep up with Amazon, or even our own website for that matter, the company was cruel, and it did those layoffs all across the country. It won't be long until everybody left there is let go soon. Additionally, the company is just not a good place to work; it's governed by incompetence, spite, and favoritism. Don't waste your time with Barnes and Noble."
bad,"naturally all retailers are there to make money, but BN has taken it to an extreme.  people are not valued, developed, or paid enough.  district and store management are manipulative, demeaning, and unkind."
bad,"Working for Barnes and Noble is exciting and enlightening yet can be tiring and stressful. Management is highly receptive to training and coaching, however, the standards that the company has can often not work well for them. Corporate can be very constricting. The main focus of the stores are to promote selling culture no matter what. Often times, selling tactics can contradict each other. "
bad,"B&N College Bookstores: Great for a summer job. No raises or praises for loyal employees. Discount on textbooks helps but honestly not worth the headache. Scheduled hours fluctuate dramatically even for loyal, 2+ year employees."
bad,"At this particular Barnes & Noble College Bookstore, the work environment is absolutely horrible. The work itself is fun, and the workers can be fun, but the general communication between management and employees, work ethic, and friendliness is so bad that it zapped any life that job had in it. I appreciate that I had this job because it taught me a lot about a typical day in retail, but I would not recommend this job to anyone."
bad,"In my experience with Barnes and Noble, I found that the negatives--some par for the course in a retail position, unfortunately--far outweighed the positives. This may very well have been a product of the store I worked with, as there are many people who truly enjoy working for the company."
bad,"Barnes & Noble was an on-campus, temporary job I held as a college sophomore. I helped students at Oakland University find the books and materials needed for their courses. I also processed online orders from the school's website as well as packaged and shipped them."
bad,"Very fast paced, great team, not so great management, get confused a lot with starbucks, turnover rate is insane, not enough communication."
bad,"When I first started I loved it. I love books, I love music, and I love coffee, and it's all there with your employee discount. My coworkers were great and I made friends quickly. The leads there are very knowledgeable and look out for you, but you can immediately see the stress they are under day in and day out. And it's clear why. The store manager there is a beast. She runs the place with a whip. You can tell she controls her anger with fake smiles but once you hit a nerve with her, she will berate you and make you feel like you are the worst associate she's ever had. And it's for simple things like not saying good morning, asking a question, or making 3 close friends. She will not allow associates to become friends. Now that I'm gone my ulcer stopped growing."
bad,"There is no typical day for me at work. If you like variety in both schedule and task, this would be great for you. If, however, you want consistency, then not so much. It seems we are always short staffed in an effort to cut and save hours. This means a single call out can turn the whole day upside down. This is compacted by the fact that it seems people who can or will fill in are few and far between. This leads to things like the few who can regularly fill in extra hours as needed being 10-20 hour-a-week part-timers working full time hours regularly without the benefits. Management style varies from manager to manager, but most simply tow the company line. Which leads me to Corporate. Corporate, who among other things, often over promises and under provides for mandatory events."
bad,"Staff was made to work twice as hard due to unrealistic SPH goals and ineffective management.  The bare minimum of staff that was working was supposed to be assisted by management, but was often left in a lurch due to the management standing/sitting around in the break room.  When staff tried to complete tasks to B&N standards, they were reprimanded.  Often times, staff was unable to find books on the shelf due to improper shelving and maintaining of the sections.  The store was often filthy and covered in dust.  Depending on which manager was on duty, management was often difficult, unapproachable, unmoving, and sometimes inappropriate and immature.  On a positive note, most of the coworkers were pleasant, knowledgeable and hardworking.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with management, while the most enjoyable part of the job was dealing with coworkers and sharing the love of literature with customers and helping them find just what they needed."
bad,This place will give you brain atrophy. Avoid it. Nobody even knows anybody else's name. The management is absolutely schizophrenic. Horrible place for a developer in need of intellectual stimulation.
bad,This corporate company will definitely teach you how to work on your own. The company believes that running the cafe is the same as running the store. There is the challenge to developing your leadership at a fast pace while handling multiple customer problems both in the cafe and the store.
bad,The communication from corporate to the stores was an issue. Either promos or projects were added at the last minute or taken away without any notification until the last minute.
bad,"Working at a bookstore sounds like a dream job for most people, but there's always a catch. B&N can be a fun environment and it's great to be on the front lines of what's new in literature. However, there is constant pressure to hit sales goals and metrics, with upper management giving precious little in the way of tools to make that happen. You WILL be asked to do every job in the store (cafe, cashier, receiving, merchandising, etc). ***Do not expect this to be a job where you get to hang out and talk about books all day.*** If you have a lot of drive and don't expect much compensation in return for your work, B&N is fine. If you're just looking for a high paying part time gig, lots of other places will pay more."
bad,"Company is throwing a lot of things at the wall to see what sticks.  As the last big bookseller, B&N is still losing ground to the 800lb gorilla, Amazon.  Lots of exciting talk, but not always the best execution."
bad,"I worked in the coffee shop. Very stressful and upper management were kinda iffy towards cafe employees. I think it would make a good first job, but other than that heck no. Not really any full time positions. I dealt with some of the meanest customers in my life working there. Coworkers were super cool though and I loved them!"
bad,"I liked my job as a barista starting out, but my dislike of the company quickly overtook me. We’re forced to throw out food that is “going bad” and aren’t allowed to take it home. We only get a 30% discount and we rarely ever get tips because Barnes and Noble thinks that tip jars “look bad”. "
bad,"While the actual work of the job was not too bad, the company policies towards part time employees were unfavorable at best. Even shift leads and management pay was abysmal."
bad,"It was fun working at Barnes and Noble, but aside from a one-time raise of a dollar back when that sort of thing was (briefly) in vogue, I received little to make my time there worthwhile. Aside from the occasional promise of a promotion somewhere in the future to keep me from quitting, there was really no reason for me to work there long term, despite a chill work environment and the joy of working in a bookstore. The pay, after taxes, was around $7 /hr, and there were no benefits to speak of. If you don't have kids or rent, it's a great job for you. Oddly, there is a high learning curve to working there, which is inconsistent with their turnover rate."
bad,"Barnes & Noble used to be a great environment to work in. Friendly co-workers, friendly customers (for the most part). B&N kept their employees happy until they realized the company is going downhill. Now, you're held at an unbelievably high standard and get paid pretty much minimum wage. Every choice B&N is making is trying to save the company, but they're losing all of their employees along the way! This job is not worth the stress."
bad,"Don't expect to get rich working for Barnes & Noble!!  They are more worried about their profits than their employees. No bonuses, holiday parties or stock sharing, but they do show their employee appreciation by giving an extra 10% employee discount twice a year.  So nice of them!!  I'd rather have a bonus instead of giving them more of my income.  Basic healthcare coverage and 401K."
bad,"The pay is painfully low for the amount of work one does, the schedule is terrible and completely erratic, and there is a never ending stream of problems needing to be solved. So, typical retail work."
bad,More for college students to work here. No room to advance. Needs better management that doesn't watch over cafe. Fun cafe workers and the customers are pretty laid back and lots of regulars. This job will help you learn to multitask.
bad,My experience was at my college's bookstore. It was during rush so it the managers did not and did not really care to know your name. There was no guidance was to do and those who were kept for a full time position were based off of nothing other than favoritism.
bad,"Barnes & Noble changed drastically during my tenure with the company.  It went from being more customer-focused and driven- a true bookselling and customer service culture- to all about the numbers.  While somewhat understandable, you can't make the sale if you don't have the staffing, drive, or time to help the customers.  You are often spread thin, trying to complete tasks and provide customer service at the same time, and getting reprimanded when tasks aren't done or numbers aren't good enough.  In my experience, managers spent a large amount of time off the floor instead of helping- one once commented that managers ""don't get paid to ring.""  Seasoned staff is currently leaving by the droves, and little problems that could easily be corrected are being blown out of proportion or ignored until they become ""offensible.""  "
bad,"Lots of work is expected for little pay. There was a variety in the daily tasks.  Most of my co-workers were super nice, but there were some very rude ones. The managers are nice and know how to run the place. The hardest part was restocking as it leaves you with sore arms.The most enjoyable part was working as a team with my coworkers. Overall, it was a good experience, but I wouldn't work here again."
bad,"I hate to say this but if unless you're looking for only about 5 hours a week then you will be fine. If you're looking for something that will give you about approx 15 hours a week then look else where. Unless you are applying for a full time position on the book floor you will not get your requested amount even with an open availability each week. You will be told that you will 'get' your minimum hours desired but then hardly receive them unless you pick some up each week. There are also no guaranties on this as well. "
bad,"Pay is LOW for the work you are required to do. after a year of busting your hump you will get a 40 cent raise... Even though the title is accounts receivable this was mostly customer service and training the stores on what to do. you spend most of your time answering calls that have nothing to do with your job because you are a cache for all customer calls! manager isn't fit for the position. will not assist with any issues you have with fellow employees, store managers or customers so be prepared to handle everything your self, not get compensated for it and then get reprimanded when your job can't be accomplished because of the issues you're having. colleagues will constantly try to tear you down, there is NO team work and a lot of cattiness. if you are hard working, intelligent and overall a great addition to a corporate office DONT WORK HERE."
bad,"A great job for book nerds (like me) but not a job where you can set roots and grow. I have been waiting a long time for a chance to advance, but favoritism plays a huge role in such matters. Management picks up ""teacher's pets"" and parade them in bookseller's faces. Nook devices and technology has changed the face of book buying worldwide, so knowing how Nook devices work might be the only real way to survive in this industry in the upcoming future."
bad,Barnes & Noble Booksellers is a great environment for book readers to shop in but they do not have any patience or understanding for workers who need more training time and learn differently. Would not recommend someone to work for this company.
bad,"I started as a part time seasonal helper and ended up staying for over a decade.  I loved being just a bookseller, but as I advanced in the company I saw the issues that were hidden within the company.  Don't mistake this job as an,"" easy, quiet environment.""  It's a quiet environment for the customers, not for the employees.  You will be given a lot of tasks, and at times you will be pulled away from those tasks, and then you will be reprimanded for not completing those tasks.  Be prepared to push the membership card, you have to be comfortable selling it.  Management will keep track of those sales numbers and you'll see it on your review.  Like I said, it's a great starter job, just don't plan on a career.  The company will not last much longer."
bad,"I work with and largely for good people.  There are, however, issues with upper management as well as an ongoing inability of our distribution center to grasp what are and are not appropriate amounts of merchandise to send to our store given limited floor space and storage space."
bad,Loved working here until unnecessary changes began to be made. Store manager was rude and callous to everyone but customers. District manager was much worse. I hope one day that changes.
bad,A decent place to work. Manager was great. Asst. Manager was a jerk. Only thing wrong is the constant push to sell membership cards. If you don't make the quota you get your hours cut so you either quit or wait to get fired. They now offer Credit Cards so you have to Push those as well. If they offered you some kind of incentive for selling them I probably would've stayed.
bad,"Cafe and book floor are not treated equally (cafe employees are treated as secondary despite all being employed by the same company.)"
bad,"At the store level it feels like you're part of a team that sinks or floats based on how well you work together. But the objectives, payroll hours, and stress that comes down from the corporate office is overwhelmingly negative. I feel like many times what we try to accomplish at the store is undermined by changes the corporation makes as a whole."
bad,"Impossible to ignore the pressures all brick and mortar stores are facing.  With thinner staffing, the challenges are many.  But the company has been trying innovative initiatives to ""right the ship""."
bad,"I worked in the cafe and it was very nice but management was extremely strict and I was never able to advance. At the end of my time there, they cut everyone's hours and I personally was only working 8-16 hours A WEEK.  I enjoyed working in the cafe a lot but wasn't making any money and had to leave."
bad,"You really feel the weight of being a part of a failing business with Barnes and Noble. Wages are set to consistently keep pace with minimum wage requirements, even in ""higher up"" positions. Most of the time, you will be acknowledged for your hard work, with the sad acceptance that the company simply can't afford to provide you the compensation you deserve."
bad,"This company expects its' staff, most of whom earn minimum wage, to keep a shrinking industry in an extremely competitive market afloat. You are required to do hard sales of their Membership program or risk losing your job. They do not provide any leeway or autonomy for lower level staff to perform well."
bad,"A typical day at work is helping customers, filling displays, and getting rid of old product. Management could be better. I love my co workers they are always willing to help when it's needed. The hardest part of the job is recommending books to customers when they don't know what it is that they really want, but that is also the best part of the job. When you help them find what they don't even know they are looking for."
bad,"Management need to empower their employees. Employees are pigeon-holed into one task, limiting their room for growth."
bad,They are great to work with but you won't be working with them for long. Working around schedules it not an issue and the culture is great but it's all temporary work with no chance to join back in.
bad,"The work environment is excellent for the avid book reader and coffee connoisseur. It makes for a wonderful part time job because working in a bookstore/coffee shop allows for building great rapport with customers. Having mostly worked in the cafe, I must say one of my favorite things is having so many regulars. It's a truly enriching experience. The discount isn't too shabby, either. "
bad,"I have worked here for almost two years and I worked in music for quite a while (which bothered me a bit because I wanted to work at customer service with the books.) I went out for a kid's lead position and even though I didn't get it, I was given the chance to work full shifts in the kid's department. However, it is HIGHLY stressful given that I have to cover almost everyone's breaks and hardly have time to keep up with the work (our store has a HUGE amount of families come in). Hours are terrible during this time of the year and the pay is even worse. I love my coworkers and most my managers, but a couple of my managers see fit to criticize almost everything I do. There are also very high standards set for the staff."
bad,"People are underpaid and under appreciated, at least when I worked there.  Too much was expected for one of the lower retail salaries in the area.  The job went downhill as managers changed, several times over the short time I worked there."
bad,"These people lost sight of books- real books.  You'd be better off getting real book knowledge from a part-time employee at Target than you would at any current B&N.  All the REAL bookish people were either laid off or they moved on to real bookstores in other boroughs.  The current staff has no real working knowledge where books are concerned, and it isn't their fault.  B&N hired people just to hire them, no book experience necessary."
bad,"The stress over getting memberships was RIDICULOUS for the employees. We had a daily goal everyday and all of us felt very pressured to meet that goal. They even had a board up with the number of memberships we sold daily (our names included) up in the backroom.  If we didn't greet a customer the managers would make a huge deal out of it and we were always understaffed for the amount of customers. My coworker got written up on her second to last day of work because she didn't get the chance to talk to a customer. But she was the only person working the entire floor upstairs and was trying to help 4 different customers at once on one of our busiest days. "
bad,"I gained many skills while I was working there, as it was my first job. A typical work day was very fast paced with no down time in a very small working environment. In my opinion however, there were very poor management skills of the direct supervisor and other managers at the location where I worked."
bad,Because of the need to make a 3% every shift. Even short 4 hr ones not on a register. To make membership sales to get raises it became to hard to work for and health was uncared for with this company.
bad,It was an okay job. The manager was the issue that made the job so tiring and irritating and non-enjoyable. Discounts were great though. Breaks were good too.
bad,"poor management and high turnover meant that very few of us were actually cross-trained to work in the entire store; in the entire 11 months I worked there, I was never given more than a brief overview of the children's section on the second floor."
bad,"As a stock associate, you only stop to take your break, you are constantly unpacking and distributing merchandise. A lot of heavy lifting (keep in mind these are boxes filled with books). The overall environment is nice but with only a $.25 wage increase a year it seems you're going nowhere."
bad,"While I was there, management was a drug addict who has since been fired, but who was borderline abusive to minimum wage employees.  Nice to talk to regular customers, though"
bad,"Barnes & Noble operates within a challenging retail climate, margins are thin, and the revolving door of CEOs creates a whirlwind of uncertainty, confusion, and turn-on-a-dime upper management decisions. It's mercurial, irrational and frustrating. But it's also an incredible environment to work in. Books and people make it worthwhile. When the District Managers and Regional Vice Presidents get out of the way, it's a fun place to work."
bad,"It was okay, I worked in a university bookstore. They had us straighten up the aisles when there was nothing to do. They didn't bother training the seasonal employees on much of anything."
bad,"I worked for the University Bookstore at UT of Chattanooga. Management was disrespectful and did not want to help a crowd of new temporary workers. The hardest part of the job was trying to get them to tell you and your fellow employees how to do your job. the most enjoyable part was leaving, but besides that i enjoyed stocking the shelves with books."
bad,"I wouldn't suggest working there. I loved most of the people I work with, but if they hire a idiot they won't fire them. So if you aren't dumb you work harder for insufficient pay. Also, the only thing that matters to this company (like a lot of places) is selling memberships. Customers are tired of being beat over the head with memberships and a few of them have really bad attitudes about it."
bad,"If you like books, do not work here. Management has been replied with people from electronics chains, and management is incentivized with commissions that regular employees do not get access to."
bad,"I loved working there for many years, but it has become apparent in recent years that corporate is just trying to milk as much money out of the brick and mortar stores as possible before it closes them down. They just fired a huge percentage of their experienced, full-time employees with no warning. Bottom line: if you like books and don't need a full time position or expect advancement opportunities, you'll do fine. Otherwise, steer clear."
bad,"You're either working the register, organizing stock, or helping someone find what they're looking for - pretty straight forward. The pay was pretty close to minimum wage. Your experience will depend on you, and if you are affected by your peers, then by your team. "
bad,"Having nothing redeeming or nice to say, I'll choose not to say anything. I remember what the company was years ago, and it hasn't been that in a long, long time..."
bad,"The job was so seasonal it was ridiculous and it was minimum wage. However, it was not all bad being that my co-workers were nice people and I got to make a lot of friends on campus"
bad,It was an okay job. It wasn't anything special. Did not like how the treated the people that work there though. Hardest part of the job was dealing with the people.
bad,merchandising product according to store guidelines.  Most enjoyable part of the job was working with the staff and also the product.  Hardest part was trying to do your job with not enough staff.
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of organizing bookshelves and working at the register"
bad,"If you have already worked retail as a lower level associate, you already know why I gave two stars. If you are young, have no experience, and are just starting to work, then go for it. If you must rely on yourself for 100% of your income, look elsewhere."
bad,A typical work day was long with long lines. I learn how to make Starbucks drinks. My managers and co-workers were nice loving and helpful people. The hardest part was keeping the fast past during the entire time of a days work. The most enjoyable part was being able to meet my co-workers.
bad,"I was put at the front of the store as a greeter almost every shift I worked for months. Then when I was put on register, nearly every time I was assigned there, they gave me the broken register. The managers are condescending for a tween store."
bad,"Just a regular retail job, not bad.  I learned how to deal with a variety of people and how to be a professional."
bad,"I thoroughly enjoyed my job, but often felt as if they placed too many restrictions, limiting earning potential as well as creativity."
bad,Weekdays are relatively slow. Weekends nonstop busy. We all work together as a team to get everything done correct and in a timely manner. Very flexible schedule.
bad,It has been a very good company for the first 11 years of my tenure the last year they have made very  Bad decisions on cutting positions and payroll. It is no longer pleasurable to work here.
bad,easy place to maneuver around; learned how to place books around the whole store in order; fast pace environment at the beginning of the school year; good student friendly customers
bad,"I loved every BN location I worked at. Managers were great and most of the time accommodating to my personal schedule. The company as a whole is pretty ungrateful to their employees though. There are only a handful of managers in each store who are full-time and many positions have been eliminated. The company chooses to get rid of their dedicated employees instead of changing their sale methods to increase profits. They'd rather cut loyal staff instead of turn their minds to the possibility of change in regards to their daily operations. Unless you're one of the lucky few who can get a manager job, there is little room for you in the company's eyes."
bad,"loved everything about working here except the bookstore management. they always messed up schedules and would be mad when you asked them to fix it. I dont know about other stores, but the management at emeryville is what made it unbearable. so many people left and starting wage is 14.55 an hour."
bad,Your day will consist of walking the store for merchandising tasks. Creating the daily schedule. Observing employees for sales behaviors. Ensuring company priorities are met.
good,"I worked for my school's Barnes and Noble company, and in the first time it was all good. But the problem of this job is that they do not pay you enough for example, they only give you 5 or even less hours in a week, which is pretty sad and harsh."
good,"Whatever image you have in your head in regards to working at a book store, forget it - it's wrong. B&N is a retail store. As much as I love the company and books and reading, actually working there is mind-numbing and stressful as working at Walmart. It is a very high stress, fast paced job, and a lot of the time you're by yourself stocking and organizing. You have to still deal with customers that don't care about books and leave stuff out all over the place. "
good,"Favoritism, insider hiring, low pay, inconvenient scheduling. However its always great to work with books, great discount in cafe and on sales floor. Events are not outrages!"
good,"A typical day would be to come in and go to the quick meetings and they send you off to your station. Sometimes its hectic and confusing and you'll probably get yelled at if you do something wrong. Even though you are JUST learning the job. Co workers are cool, management doesnt like for co workers to have friendly conversations. Its like the managers have their group and the employees have their group. The hardest part of the job is when the store gets full and you have to handle all of that. On top of that you dont get paid very much."
good,"Easy job.My current position is 4hrs a week, no room for improvement or advancement. Managers will not allow me to work more hours"
good,I left Barnes and Noble a long time ago. My understanding is the store made a dramatic positive change with a new manager after I left.
good,"Working there was a new experience for me but it is very customer orientated. EVERYTHING is centered around doing whats best for the customers and increasing sales, sales, sales."
good,It was okay to work here. unfortunately management has undergone many changes and has had a lot of hiccups business wise. you must have a flexible schedule to work here or else you will not enjoy it at all. Management isn't the most understanding.
good,"Hours for students are sometimes flexible in terms of having to go to class, however, for the requirements of the job with no benefits, $7.25/ hr is not reasonable."
good,"This is more of a job to have on the side , it does not pay enough nor do they give you enough hours ranges from 10 to 16 hours max. The management is very poor and they try to cut as many hours as possible no rewards or compensations given they do not really care for their workers."
good,Most of the employees here are great to work with. Unfortunately the other employees make the job very hard to work at. The management is not flexible with hours and the will try to give you as few hours as they possibly can.
good,"Manager was rude, large disconnect between upper and lower level employees. Wish it would have worked out because I love books and coffee so it really was kind of the perfect job."
good,Good place to work if you dont need the money and love books. Not a place to work if you expect organization and to earn a living wage.
good,"I joined Barnes and Noble because of my love of reading, and education. I helped open one of their major new stores and enjoyed the organization and processes of shelving. I became music manager and made record breaking sales in my first year. My first manager was a driven, motivated person and was very good at motivating people. I enjoyed working with all of my co-workers, and I liked the creative freedom you had when merchandising. The most difficult part of the job, was trying to balance everything that we were given as managers in a timely manner."
good,Really liked the people I worked with. The only problem angry customers would come in with nook problems and needed help using it.
good,I learned how to do alot like completing inventory and other things but managers showed favoritism and to me that was unprofessional.
good,"I work well under pressure in any environment, the café was usually very busy. I enjoyed my time at Barnes & Nobles before I gave my two week notice, friendly staff and great team environment."
good,Barnes and Noble was a dream job. That's till I worked for them. Nothing else matters but the amount of memberships you sell. If you do not meet their quota for selling membership you get written up or even fired. That is their number one goal is the sale of memberships. It's a sales job not a fun bookstore job.
good,"Customers can be the downfall to any experience, refusal to take responsibility for themselves can get you in trouble without process. That is usually outweighed by the number of people who aren't like that and don't make an effort to be understanding and patient with the kinks in customer service."
good,"I was originally hired on as bookseller and then moved to Merchandise Manager (changed to SIM). Reduced labor, overemphasis on nonsensical metrics (ie member card percentages, secret shop scores), and poor communication within store and company have made this job unbearable. Would recommend looking elsewhere for a retail job."
good,"The Barns & Noble was an okay place, if your fresh out of high school or retired. I also great if you need extra cash for the holidays. Give the job a try."
good,I enjoyed working with all new people and talking to customers who came in. I met many people while working here and enjoyed the environment. working there was a fun experience.
good,"A typical day at work for me in the Barnes and Noble cafe included preparing coffee based drinks, preparing and serving cafe foods while maintaining a well-kept, clean lobby. The workplace culture was very peaceful and mostly calm."
good,Management skills are lacking in every way possible. Horrible staffing issues and therefore not a very pleasant place to work. Ok maybe for a summer job but nothing long term for sure.
good,"Barnes and Noble online was a fun place to work, but the pay was horrible out of season.  They did not account for having the expense of all the security measures and the little amount of pay we were receiving. Management were not consistent, so reviews were not based on all the same guidelines.  One manager would give great reviews and the next week  another manager would give poor reviews."
good,"this is a good first job for someone who is a reader and is not worried about earning a living wage. the district management is micromanaged and there is a level of anxiety personified by the local store management teams. i was afforded opportunities to further develop my skills or talents but that pursuit was never guided or assisted and was usually self sought. the reputation the company earned over the last fifty years exits as a memory, with the advent of mobile technology and e-commerce they have become a shell of what they use to be pertaining to the level of service or expectation that the local store's staff is actually knowledgeable about the products they sell. the company seems desperate to maintain some foothold of relevancy in the new 21st century marketplace with the Amazons and Apple and kindle and iPad taking away their complacency, after Borders Books closed the internal standards expected of their salesfloor employees drastically changed and an aggressive sales culture took hold in lieu of passion for books. the sales culture would be fine if they were commission based employers but they expect the employee to up-sell and harbor lofty sales goals with no incentive, increase in hours, no benefits, no commission, and no real sense of reward or reinvestment in the actual job. the only was to promote is to be willing to work at every store in your region then move to another timezone and work at a job where there is no transfer or equivalent job position guaranteed. okay for those seeking a 30% discount on books or a 20% discount on movies and music or a 50% discount"
good,"I really liked working there in the beginning. But the managers are lazy and they like to pick favorites. It can be a hostile working environment at times. The schedule sucks, too. I almost always work Friday, Saturday, AND Sunday. So expect your social life to go out the window. The customers can be very rude, as well. Overall, after three years of dedicated working service, I am just plain sick of it."
good,"It's a good place to get stuck in a bubble. I'm sure that the environment at another location could have lead me to a better experience, however this particular Barnes and Noble was not for me."
good,On a Typical Day working at Barnes and Noble when I did Nook it was best feeling in world I loved to help people and assist them about the nook Devices. I loved to inform people on all the specs and Great features about the Device. I also loved teaching classes on how to use the device. what I learned is that people love to read more then I ever thought and I also learned that soon because of E-readers or Tablets. my managers to me where Terrible. The Store always seems behind we always was low on staff and they treated us like kids. and they never gave out hours only towards the holidays. My co-workers was ok they was quiet and did their job. The hardest part of my job was convincing customers why they should get a E-reader or Tablets over books. The most Enjoyable part of my job was the Nook people they gave me a reason to smile and a reason to want to come to work.
good,I worked mostly in the cafe though I was cross trained to help on the bookfloor. I enjoyed making drinks and didn’t mind cleaning. The customers really sucked since we were in a mall and in my 5 years it felt like 4 of those we were severely understaffed. Only reason I stayed was my awesome coworkers. The managers did their best with what corporate gave them. The constant fear of Secret Shoppers and the store manager breathing down your neck about member cards really made me dread coming to work.
good,"I worked for this company for seven years, five were as a manager. I was constantly told that I could move up in the company yet other younger unqualified people would be promoted ahead of me. This had everything to do with work politics and caddy employees. I absolutely loved the company but hated the people that I worked with. The pay rate is not worth it, I could make that plus more in a part-time non managerial position."
good,"mediocre, would recommend as a first job for teens fresh out of high school "
good,Wasn’t a very good place to work I wasn’t treated fairly because my lifestyle wasn’t the same as the rest of the people that Work there and I was treated badly because I had a disability
good,"Once upon a time this was a fun place to work, but now it's all about getting as much work as possible out of each employee while giving them minimum hours. Demands and expectations increased while resources, time, and benefits deceased. The employee discount is pretty good though."
good,"I had two very good managers during my time at Barnes and Noble, while the other managers were horrible. Worse, the district manager knew that these managers were not operating on policy, and would not do anything about. Barnes and Noble frequently takes advantage of their employees by utilizing low pay and short hours. You would frequently get four hour shifts a day and maybe be scheduled 8-16 hours a week if you were not full time. Since the company is going under, they value their customers over their employees. I had many customers harass me because of my skin color or sexuality, and the company would not protect me, which is ultimately why I left."
good,"Once upon a time this was a fun place to work, but now it's all about getting as much work as possible out of each employee while giving them minimum hours. Demands and expectations increased while resources, time, and benefits deceased. The employee discount is pretty good though."
good,I loved all of my employees and coworkers.  I enjoyed speaking with customers about books or helping them with their Nook devices.  There is little room for advancement and the company promotes poor business decisions while ignoring the concerns of their employees.
good,Depending on the manager they can either make or break a team and work environment. I've worked for wonderful stores I would have happily worked there forever and some stores I couldn't wait to leave.
good,"I have worked at Barnes & Noble for almost twenty years. I love the customers, the books and my fellow employees. I was able to share my love of books with everyone around me. For most of my twenty years Barnes & Noble was a great place to work that allowed me to work full time and provide benefits for my family. Recently the company has undergone a restructuring and, in that process I lost my full time status, benefits for my family and the work family life balance."
good,The Booksellers are the backbone of this company. The industry keeps changing without any defined solutions from leadership. Great environment for directly working with clients
good,When I first started I was very excited to learn and grow with the company not anymore they’re constantly changing things and making it very difficult for you to do your job and  Advance with the company. They’re hiring outside management with no knowledge and having you train them. I  don’t recommend working for Barns And Noble at all.Very stressful
good,"Many tasks assigned by HQ don't make sense in our store.  As an example, running a high discount promotion when there is no product to sell.  Helping customers is very satisfying."
good,"Managers did not do the kind of work expected of them, and instead left it to the other associates most of the time.   Whenever big events came up, the store manager would buy only a handful of the employees food/beverages, and not the whole of the store.   Seriously showed favoritism in this way, which is not a good thing for any company."
good,"The only benefit of working here is the employee discount. The other booksellers are great to work with, but the store manager is overbearing, confrontational, and has ridiculous daily goals in place for the employees. If you don't fulfill those goals, be ready for a talk from management."
good,A typical day at Barnes and Noble would consist of customer care and working cashier counter. However with change of management the store began to change and there began to be a lot of gossip and hostility in the work place. The hardest thing about working here is the constant hour cuts made to their employees making it a struggle to make more money.
good,Nice enough bookstore. Nothing to write home about. Seasonal job for extra cash. Worked at a register and used a computer to find/order books/dvds/products for customers.
good,"I loved working with the customers & my co-workers, but the main manager left a lot to be desired. He was not easy to talk too & nothing was good enough."
good,This job is a great part-time employment but to get full time hours proved difficult for me.  They chose full-time employees by seniority and if you were only there for a few months you would not be considered for advancement.
good,They have a corporate culture of threatening your job if you cannot meet the weekly quota of membership sales. Very depressing work environment. Management is not concerned with employee turnover.
good,Worked for BN for 5 years. Loved working in every department and cross trained to know the different areas of the business. Biggest problem is management and knowing what there doing and how to run a business.
good,"Barnes & Noble is a good place if you are looking for a quick job but if you intend to stay and one job and EVER move up or EVER get a raise or ANY kind of benefits, it would be best to look elsewhere.  Barnes & Noble both as a company and management-wise is not very employee oriented."
good,"Processed, Printed orders in Receiving, organized merchandise in store room for employees, managed inventory with Receiving Manager"
good,Maintain the book selling floor. The managers do not work at all.
good,"a typical day is coming in 15 minutes earlier than your shift time , clocking in , team meeting and then going to work at your station and staying there all day , helping customers and answering the phone if you are by the phone and not moving from that station at all. co workers were nice but management was annoying and lazy . most enjoyable part of the day were the customers they were really nice and fun and your break."
good,"It is a typical corporate retail environment. Good job to take if you are in transition or have nothing (one of the better retail jobs though) but gets old fast. Upper management is like a scarecrow placed to take the fall. Went through a few and the only thing in common is their stupidity,sense of entitlement and laziness. The productive employees can only reach a certain level of advancement, but if you are very lazy, you can make it to the top. They typically like drones and do not encourage creative thinking or ideas to boost sales (you must follow corporate visual merchandising and instructions or else!). The Cafe i always an issue since employees pretend they cannot do anything so they are not placed there (same pay- way way harder labor)."
good,"Management was pretty bad, they were all very narrow minded and unappreciative . My co- workers were very welcoming and enthusiastic. The hardest part of my job was being under appreciated. The most enjoyable part f my job was the customers and clock out time ."
good,"The stress level of the job was not worth the pay. They placed me in the cafe, which is the busiest part of the bookstore, on my first day, and then they never allowed me to try out working in any other part of the store."
good,"The job was great I loved it, management not so much. Be prepared for a narcissistic and sexist store manager. They also want you to be free whenever they need you which is not how life works..."
good,Started out as a combination of hobby and career. Needs of the position required you to give up everything else. The joy left with the payroll. The HQ staff does not listen and keeps blaming the stores for everything that does not go well.
good,Working for BN was amazing and had it's perks of meeting new people the daily grind of selling memberships and the flexible options given for shifts..
good,"Most days as a bookseller involve endlessly putting books back where they belong, helping customers find/ order titles, and keeping the store clean. Working as a barista is awful. On slower days you are working the bar alone and sometimes without backup which leads to very low morale."
good,"For my time at Barnes And Noble the Store Manager was let go due to the fact of how he ran the store. We were always under staffed at the store and even if you get an almost perfect performance review, you only get a .50 cent increase."
good,"The day to day life is filled with shelving books, cleaning up shelves, and helping customers find what they want. This is about the same in any bookstore, but what's different about B&N is that corporate has no idea how to stay relevant. Essentially, books have about a one-month shelf life which financially makes sense but adversely affects customer relations. I remember many times where a customer asked for a book and I'd be surprised that we didn't have it. The usual response to this was, ""Well I'll get it on Amazon;"" ergo B&N loses sales by having quick turnaround times for books. The leads and managers recognize this issue, but their hands are tied by the demands of corporate which has this bad habit of dumping its inventory to follow trends. If the employees had a bit more autonomy, then this wouldn't be an issue. My coworkers cared deeply; corporate doesn't."
good,"If you like books and like to upsell, this is for you. Managers try to make it fun everyday. You are able to work in different areas of the store so that everyday is different."
good,"Pay and hours leave workers unable to pay for their cost of living, the work is stressful and often unrewarding. Corporate quotas leave even the most efficient of us feeling unappreciated and lacking. Upper management does not want to hear, and refuses to understand the position and opinions of employees. Cut hours and lead positions leaves stores understaffed and stressed; however, same quotas and sales goals apply. When work goes undone due to poor staffing, understaffed and busy stores are seen as an excuse rather than an explanation."
good,"Although I was only there a short time, it was a stressful job. Often I was working alone during rushes and my manager was a distraction. It was useful that a lot of others in the store were understanding when they ordered or when I needed an extra bit of help during rushes."
good,"My manager was not the best and didn't show much respect for communication. "
good,the company is more focused on making money with the least amount of people working than with the working environment for those workers. the people that work there tend to be good people and fun to work with and very driven workers.
good,"Search for books, shelve books, order books, check out. Lots of customer service. Typical retail. At the mercy of the retail giant open every single day. Poor salary no benefits"
good,"I learned a lot from working at Barnes and Noble. I was a transfer from the Palm Desert, California store in May 2017, but the experience remained the same. Although I loved working with my coworkers, corporate tried making drastic, and unnecessary, changes that left many of coworkers here and back home jobless and questioning their positions. I have dealt with different types of customers from incredibly rude to condescending to the nicest people you'll ever meet. My time there was unforgettable mainly because eof the people I shared it with both back home and in Las Vegas. It's a great first job for anyone looking during seasonal months, but if you can progress and advance(corporate made it next to impossible now) in this retail chain, I wouldnt get your hopes up. The pay isn't worth it, especially with each review you'll get a quarter(.25¢) raise, you're reviews comes in once every year. So, if you don't experience in retail, you'll start at base pay."
good,"They claim to have a ""family"" atmosphere, but if management of your particular department does not like you personally, good luck with that. The body will treat you just as the head does."
good,Easy enough place to work if you don't mind having to shove memberships down customer throats. Expect to have a very very high sales demand with no job security for having way above numbers for their matrix.
good,"As competitors such as Amazon grow increasingly threatening to the remaining retailers, corporate culture struggles to survive. Hours are cut during slow seasons, and many days often are understaffed. Management has a 'team player attitude' but does not provide any actual resources to assist in well-rounded job performance. In other words: they ask you to aim for the stars, but start you in the gutter. A polished company from the exterior, typical corporate America within. Fine as a seasonal set-up, though not over long periods of time."
good,"A typical day at work can vary per time of year. If it's school year, it's slow and there are a lack of hours provided.  If it's holiday season, it's constantly moving and there are more hours given.  I've learned about the book industry. Management varies, but seems to change often. When management gets stressed, it does not seem to be handled professionally among the staff. The culture of the workplace is one of the better parts. Those who have been with the company for more than 4 years have become close and work together when things gets stressful. The hardest part of the job is maintain composure when customers or management made a simple task 10x harder. The most enjoyable part of the job are the books."
good,"Not too bad of a place to work. Management is usually pretty flexible with scheduling as long as you give them advanced notice. However, i was there for close to 11 years, and they cut me down to 4 hours a week. At one point i wasn't even scheduled at all."
good,While the job responsibilities are rewarding they are ofter overshadowed by lack of construction management and lack of corporate interaction. Both of those qualities lead to a increase of job dissatisfaction.
good,"You will not advance within the same store. They only hire managers from outside the company or from another store. If you need a 9/hr stable job, this is honestly a good one."
good,It is fun being around books and people who enjoy reading. The pay is extremely low and you can catch yourself getting minimum wage while working some really fast paced days.
good,"Typical work day centered on assisting customers in their search for store products, cashing them out at time of purpose and upselling products and memberships."
good,Barnes and Noble is an exciting and sometimes fast paced place to work at. If you are looking for a first job that pays min wage this is the place for you. It's quiet and organized and if you like to read it's a plus. Employees usually get a 30% discount on most itmes. My only complaint would be the lack of money they are willing to pay you for the amount of work they want you to do. The comapny wants you to go above and beyond for them but I don't see any appreciation in return.
good,"In general, a fun atmosphere with fun co-workers.  There is little room for advancement and the remuneration for merchandising managers is woeful at $13.50 per hour.  Retail in general is on shaky ground and with this company in particular.  Nitpicking from a clueless corporate office is routine.  There are employee cookouts and potlucks."
good,"A typical day is rare. Everything depends on what is happening in the moment with regards to my manager's workload. I do a lot of scheduling of meetings, travel arrangements, processing expense reports. It can vary day to day so I have learned to prioritize each day with a quick check in with my manager so we can level set the day and effectively manage expectations of his direct reports.  The hardest part of my job is waiting for a department to complete a certain task in order to meet a tight deadline.  But, the most enjoyable part of my job is being able to focus on what is important and having the resources to accomplish the task on time.  I just do it without complaint and move on."
good,Barnes and Noble has recognized my talent in regards to building a competent and reliable team and my commitment to providing consistent/excellent customer service to its shoppers.  I've been promoted twice in less than three years and have been interviewed as a district training cafe manager.  The work-load required of the cafe manager position related to the compensation and expected hours worked/week hasn't made me feel as valued as the encouragement and the acknowledgement that I've received from my superiors.
good,"My job of making coffee was enjoyable and i loved my co-workers but management was horrible to me and that is why i left. My cafe training was lengthy, in depth, and fun. My co-workers became like a second family to me."
good,"nice people to work with, disorganized and difficult to find a routine, no room for advancement, needs to have better plan of action"
good,"A day at work is not especially difficult. The job itself is not typically challenging, but it can be. You, the employee, are on your feet all day for, on average, 8 hours. There is a lot of bending down and picking up large stacks of books that lazy and inconsiderate customers decide are appropriate to leave on the floor or on the shelves or wherever they please really. "
good,"while working on such a friendly, safe college campus offers the opportunity for building bonds and a fun work environment. However the level of professionalism among management leaves a lot to be desired."
good,"As the head cashier, I was expected to sell at least 2% worth of membership cards a day. At $25/year for a card, this proved to be the most difficult part of the job. Most customers stated they do not buy enough books to justify that purchase. However, I tried regardless and always kept my head up about my daily duties. My favorite part of this job was the conversations with customers that were like-minded. Discussing books and coffee was always fun. It was, however, a lot about the numbers and your hours could be based off of your member card sales."
good,"I am a transfer from California, where they ran a tight ship; adhered to all the rules, were organized, managers pushed employees for advancement, nice overall structure. This store, not so much. Very lax on just about everything, and that starts with management. My manager was not only terrible at his job, but also was vindictive and did not take criticism well, which made working there very unpleasant.Co-workers were all good and on the same page as me as far as how management ran the business. Hardest part of the job was being able to please a manager that makes up his own rules. Hours are not steady or consistent."
good,"Good company to work for, quick move up.  terrible pay.  Staff at this location are mean.  good benefits. can learn a lot by working for this comapny"
good,Your coworkers are great but the management team sucks and the pay is not very good. The schedule is regular but there is no room at all for advancement.
good,Hard work and knowlege of books is a must. There are great employees and lots of fun can be had but you must be able to pull the corporate line.
good,"I enjoy working with people as well as serving people. I have a positive attitude and I enjoy being around people. Management liked me at Barnes and Noble, because I can't sit still. I'm always doing, (whether it's cleaning, restocking or washing dishes.) "
good,It was an upbeat place to work customer's were usually friendly
good,"Sold textbooks, my coworkers were fun. I was a cashier most the day and help people with textbook questions,"
good,Good opportunity but i preferred longer shifts vs. shorter shifts they gave.
good,"coworkers are nosy. good discounts. they're very flexible with your work schedule, but not tolerable to tardiness.. i seen a few employees get fired right away for contiguously calling out."
good,"A Digital Sales Lead basically stands in front of the store and try to convince people to buy the Nook. That's it. If there are no customers, there is nothing for you to do. You just stand around all day and wait for someone to come in and buy a Nook. You are not allowed to play with the Nook, read on it, play a game on it or well anything but sell it."
good,I learned alot such as completing inventory and shipping and receiving but there alot of favoritism and a lack of respect.
good,"In order to save money to increase their bottom line, Barnes and Noble has accepted a policy that reduces the number of full-time employees as to save on medical/dental, STD and LTD benefits, as part-time employees do not receive these benefits."
good,"Responsible for placing out stock, assisting customers with phone or online orders. Cashier duties, packing book returns to warehouse and gift wrapping customer orders."
good,"B&N started great, and I loved the bookstore environment. I quickly realized that management cared far more about profit and pushing membership cards (REALLY pushing membership cards) than it did about its employees or customers. The employee discount was alright, but by the time I left they had started to cut down on them, particularly the cafe discount. "
good,"It was part time work and while the management team at the location was good, the lack of pay compared to other retailers has increased employee turnover during the last several years."
good,"Very fluctuated hours, not consistent week to week. Low pay, but due to the state worked in minimum wage.  Good employee discount.  Jobs weren't consistent such as working in clothing or working in cafe."
good,"I worked at the cafe, so a typical day at work could be swan diving into a rush of people then crickets. I had been a bookseller since 2013 but it was my first time working in  the cafe part time, even though I have been trained in both the bookfloor and cafe previously, it had been many years since, so I had no idea what changes had been made."
good,"I was hired for the holiday season and asked to continue on afterwards. I was a cashier at first, but I also worked in the kids' department for a few months before I quit. As a cashier, a shift could go by very quickly during the months leading up to Christmas and even the first few weeks of the new year. After this though, a shift could drag on forever. I can't say that I learned much except that I don't enjoy working retail. The management was obsessed with employees selling Barnes & Noble memberships. They really wanted new members and if you got people to renew, the managers were unimpressed. Then when the company insisted that we push the B&N credit card, things got worse. Someone, not sure if it was corporate, regional, or district, decided to make getting customers to apply for credit cards a competition. They started keeping track of how many employees asked people about the credit card and then how many of those customers applied. It was a lot of pressure. I liked a number of the people I worked with which made coming in nice, but the attitudes of some of the managers was off putting. I'd say the hardest part of the job was selling those darn memberships and convincing people not to buy through Amazon instead. The most enjoyable part of the job were some of the interesting customers that came into the store. The store I worked in is in an outdoor shopping mall with a movie theater at one end, and lots of people would mill around waiting for a movie to start. I got to see people in Star Wars cosplay which was fun. I don't know if they're still pushing the store credit"
good,Not a bad place for park time workers who are in college or whatnot but impossible to make a full time career out of it. I was a barista for 2 years with minimal pay and crazy hours. The bookstore vibe is cool and chic but it's always busy in the cafe and we were always short staffed.
good,"Working at Barnes and Noble is an experience that people should get, being the last standing bookstore in the country that's corporate. You have to work your butt off to get just an ounce of praise and then theirs criticism on how you do your job. so you seriously have to work even harder for a job that shouldn't take so much out of you. Its a great experience due to culture and you meet so many great people such as customers and coworkers who give you great recommendations and opinions which are vital to the future and culture of books."
good,"No backup, minimal staffing in cafe, no respect for cafe staff, management problems, but the work itself was fine.  Opening and closing are easy with enough experience.  Customers at bookstores tend to be less demanding than at a real coffee place."
good,"I do not get enough hours to have a sustainable living. The work environments is okay. I like the people I work with. However, the hourly pay is low and I only work about 12 hours per week."
good,They offered medical and dental but it was retail so nights and weekends were mandatory. It got to be really hard around the holidays and during bad weather.
good,Be prepared to not see your family during the holidays. the environment is relaxed until November than you are expected to be there constantly.  Alittle tough for a single mother.
good,I loved everything about the job except for the poor decisions that came from those higher up in the company as well as management being very unorganized.
good,"I started working here 5 years ago when I was still in school looking for a part-time job to make some money. Over the years, I've attempted to move up in the company multiple times but was always overlooked or denied in favor of some outside hire who never had any intention of sticking around long enough to make a decent impact on the store. I've outlasted 4 store managers, a dozen or so ASM's, and countless booksellers to be the most senior bookseller at my location and yet that's still not good enough to be promoted. The only reason I'm still here is that of the enjoyable work environment, but even that has its limits."
good,The public is exceedingly demanding! The company micro-manages too much. The stores have zero autonomy. Wages are low. Benefits are practically non-existent.
good,"help customers, ring up purchases, clean up behind people's kids, clean up behind adults, deal with book releases, stupid people asking stupid questions."
good,"If you're looking for a place that pushes sales, and appeasing to customers, while not being able to express how you truly feel, about a customers actions towards you then this is the spot for you. If you're misled into thinking that it's wonderful working at a book store, you get to rid so much. That is not correct. You have to sell memberships, and act as a loss prevention. "
good,"good staff, poor management"
good,"With ten years invested in the company, work standards have decreased, work advancement opportunities have decreased, and the expected work per shift has doubled to tripled. Company core values have changed in a manner that does not protect the employee's health or give any sense of job security. The turnover rate of employees has turned into the point where six months later it is almost like there is a whole new staff running the store and each turnover the staff is less knowledgeable of the merchandise or the company's standards. The company has the right to at any given time to eliminate any and all full-time positions, there is no job security and because of it a negative atmosphere has been made in stores. The company also dramatically changes discounts without notice to employees."
good,pleasant environment but very little upward mobility and low compensation. management should provide more direction to staff and more training. Company needs to change business strategy to become more competitive
good,"The workers are very nice. You feel like you can talk to people. Customers are friendly when they want to be. You have no room to advance. You do not have benefits unless you are full time, which is only managers. You do not get paid time off or paid sick days."
good,While a lot of the people at this location were super nice the amount of customers served hourly for the cafe is terrifying. they'll work you 39.5 hours a week so they don't need to give you benefits.
good,"While this job was very easy to do after having over a year of experience at an actual Starbucks, it was very low paying, offered very few hours and had no opportunity to increase either of these."
good,"As a temporary employee you are thrown into the workday with little experience, which I tend to prefer. However, every long term employee there treats you as disposable and acts like your boss. It can be a very frustrating job."
good,This would have been a good job had the manager cared about doing more than the absolute bare minimum. The people hired while I was there ended up being terrible and then ended up being fired because the manager only cared about having a warm body in the positions instead of looking into hiring good employees. He did not care if the store was severely understaffed. The easiest part of the job was dealing with the customers and the most difficult was dealing with management. It is very obvious that the company is slowly dwindling and going under by how little they pay their employees and how they only offer benefits to their full-time employees.
good,Barnes & Noble was interesting in that we were supporting a product that was very new to Barnes & Noble and it had a feel of learning as you go as a company.
good,Management definitely played favorites with some of the workers. Never felt like the older workers did wrong and often tried to scare the new and temporary workers to do work while everyone else relaxed.
good,"Responsible for digital department, analyzing and interpreting sales information to drive digital business"
good,"The company and employees have declined in morale and there is little to no opportunity to move up in the company. No promotions ever, and turn over is super high."
good,things wouldn't be so bad if they just didn't lay off 2 head cashiers and the receiving manager to save some money it would have made things a lot easier if we had those people and  probably would have got a better score
good,Overlooked for any advancement despite clearly being the hardest working and most knowledgeable member of my department. Friends are valued over competent workers. Quality standards were low.
good,I adore my coworkers and management staff. The company is running it's self into the ground. The business model is out dated and the changes they are attempting are taking too long to take effect.
good,"I ran a Starbucks known as a Barnes & Noble Cafe in a busy downtown College Bookstore location off campus. Got boring after 5 years, no room to go anywhere, and I heard corporate pays even worse than Department managers."
good,"Barnes and Noble is a good place for first time job applicants. The environment is pretty calm for a retail store. Over the years, it feels like the company is less customer driven and more sales driven. You are forced to try to get people to buy membership cards--they are not free like in so many other places, and people don't want to have to pay to get a discount. Management changed 4 times in 7 years, though the main core of staff didn't, and it caused a lot of conflict and tension in the store. The best part of the job was helping customers to leave satisfied and grateful."
good,"Barnes and Noble was a great place to work when it was about books. Now it's just about the Nook and memberships. When I started we had to talk to customers about books first, and memberships second. We had to take the customer to the book and suggest another. Now they point to the vague area you might find the book, and it might actually be alphabetized. When I left, employees were only valued based on the memberships or Nooks they could sell. But the discounts are nice, and they have an employee discount week, which a lot of people waited enthusiastically for. Now as a customer, the cafe is hit or miss. They don't seem to realize there is a Caribou a hundred yards from their door. Anyone in the store might be working in there, so it's not very cafe-specialized service or knowledge."
good,The work was fine but could be considered very repetitive. The company only hired part time staff so that they wouldn't have to pay for benefits which limits the growth as an employee
good,"I love reading & so a job @ Barnes & Noble was Awesome!  Sadly the corporate need to focus on greed made the job less fun.  I was good at selling books, but that never mattered as the instructions were to always hawk the Barnes & Noble card & convince people they needed the Nook reader.  I do have great appreciation for the Nook, I just feel too much was focused on it & feel I was proved right a few years after I left I heard the reader essentially became part of a different company.  As far as the Barnes & Noble card went, I feel it was more of a rip off than an advantage & it really depressed me when the little old folks on fixed incomes that would never actually learn how to use the card to their advantage would ask for the card.  While I never told them my opinion ~ I felt guilty.  It’s not right to treat people that way & I’m glad I don’t have to sell that card anymore.  I think it’s sad that the corporate world chooses to create cash cows like that card rather than just letting good sales people do their job of selling things people want to buy."
good,There is no work-life balance. Although you can advance if you excel in metrics and you have no family and no outside life. I have experience inappropriate verbal assault from a store manager to lower managers. I have experience lots of profanity. I have personally felt retaliated against when I call out sick or do anything else to rub the manager the wrong way. I have experience or witness retaliation against other employees with the same reason. My schedule is often changed without my permission. After it is posted which is unlawful
good,fun place to work but ultimately bookstores are dying as a breed thus there is absolutely zero opportunity for growth at this company.  the discount isn't bad if your into that sort of thing
good,in the cafe most of the day dealing with snotty customers when it gets busy managers still wants everything to be perfect and up to speen even with 0 coverage
good,"Working at Barnes and Noble was a great experience. The employees were great but I do have to say the only thing that made me hate working there was the management. In order to be a ""good employee"" one must sell enough memberships for $25. It is very difficult to convince people who don't go there as much why they would benefit from getting a membership. If you don't sell, managers will be on you making it very uncomfortable, one even went as far as telling me she would have to let me go if I didn't get my numbers up. Needless to say I found another job asap and quit B&N. Other than the managers and the constant reminder of the memberships working there was really fun!"
good,"Long slow days, Management goes from abyssal to good, workplace culture is a farce, hardest part of job is management and their nagging to make you care when you dont get paid enough to do so."
good,"Cashiering was tough as we were required to sell a $25.00 membership for every four hours worked. "
good,As a manager for the company you have to be available 24/7. So if you are a single parent and have a child in daycare you can not be a manager at this company. After almost 5 years I had to resign from my position as a manager because of this.
good,"It's kinda boring as a cashier you can't walk around the store because you have to watch out for customers. I liked some of the customers i had the pleasure to meet. And people i worked with were fun. the hardest part about my job was to sell membership, not a lot of people want to spend $25 for a membership."
good,"In the 3 years that I've worked here I have seen about 30 people come and go because the pay is bad, there's no chance to grow, and the benefits are nothing special."
good,I worked for a terrible manager who liked to yell at his employees before customers. The  job was okay while I attended school since it was on campus.
good,"My store is a little desperate with hiring people. Every manager or assistant to the store manager has been here for about 2 years and then they leave. Communication is terrible. Pay is not bad, but they cut your hours drastically. They will tell you one thing but then do something completely different."
good,"i love working around books and Barnes and noble provides that but i didn't appreciate the unprofessional the managers act toward customers, as soon as they leave they talk bad about them out loud for everyone to hear."
good,It's a good job for someone just starting out in retail and for college students. Decent management. Lot's of talk among coworkers though.
good,Few years ago i worked at Barnes and nobles. i am grateful to this company for giving me the opportunity to acquire and gain experience in customer services.
good,"A typical day at work for B&N employees includes some great customers. I worked primarily in the Children's department and the parents and kids were usually pretty great. You do projects when you get the chance. Higher management is great, the in store managers typically are trying to get into higher management and spend their time ""delegating"" their tasks to lower employees and taking credit. There are a lot of unfulfilled promises, and people working in management/ lead positions without the title or pay that go with it. The hardest part of this job was getting all the projects done while still making the customer feel as though they are your priority. The most enjoyable part of the job is talking with people and helping them find books to expand their experiences or finding books for kids that hate to read, that they are excited about reading."
good,If you have to work in retail Barnes and Noble is probably one of the better places to work. You're surrounded by books and people who enjoy reading all day and the employee discount is a beautiful thing. Moving up is hard and takes a long time/a lot of work.
good,"A typical day at work during the holidays was very busy. I served approx. 1,000 customers in my time there. I learned that people are always going to expect more of you than you can sometimes give, and it's okay if you can't satisfy everyone. The management was relatively unprofessional, and a few of the managers were rude and stuck up. My co-workers on the other hand were great, kind, and welcoming, and there was not a single day where one of them upset me. The hardest part of the job was handling angry customers and not being able to stand up for myself if I felt as if a manager was treating me poorly. The most enjoyable part was the kind customers that maintained a positive conversation with me and made my days."
good,Fun co-workers and customers. Decent benefits. Scheduling system is a mess. Several close-opens for managers and team members.
good,"Nice entry-level job in a relaxing, fun environment. The customers are usually kind and intelligent, as well as the staff. Sometimes there aren't enough people scheduled at one time, however, and depending on where you're scheduled you'll find yourself running around like a chicken with its head cut off. This can be good or bad depending on your temperament."
good,The hours weren't the best and neither was the pay but it was a job none the less.
good,"Great job stability, low pay.  The company is outdated when it comes to the current movement of corporate structure.  No merit increase for non salaried employees.  No exit packages the lower level management.  And outdated with compensation packages."
good,"Barnes and Noble always seemed like a great place to work, and when I got the job I was very excited.  I worked in the cafe and learned a ton of stuff about having the job, although it wasn't all I hoped it would be."
good,The overall work day was pretty good most customers were easy to assist.  Holidays were always a little stressful with the amount of product.  Good job to have if in school or single.
good,"I really liked my cafe job. I enjoyed making drinks to the customers satisfaction, I even came up with a few creations of my own using their ingredients which also helped me up sell a lot of the drinks.The other cafe servers were fun to work with and it was a good environment. "
good,"i learned the procedures selling and finding books for customers, putting books back in the right place was hard, i enjoyed reading and helping the children."
good,"Speaking for myself, each scheduled day was full(busy). Did primarily backroom/ shipping + receiving duties."
good,"The typical day was always a busy one but depending on your role, there was always something different to do."
good,"pick up boxes, bulk induction, selecting, different forklifts"
good,"It's just ok. Not the worst job I've ever had, but certainly not the best. Work is scarce at times and when there is a lot to do, there aren't enough people to do it. I have seen over half of my coworkers leave over the short time I have worked here, without any replacements coming in. The days are very unpredictable, I never know what I will be doing or where I will be or if there is even any work. "
good,Manager turnover was out of control. They don't allow managers to have anything but full availability. You basically have to teach yourself everything. The staff was very friendly with a few bad apples.
good,"The only reason I chose not to tank that stores star ratings is because the cafe staff and manager were amazing. Other than that the book side management staff (not sellers) was often condescending towards the cafe workers, customers often better discounts than employees, its the only cafe in America that doesn't allow a tip jar, and you are never compensated by doing the tons of extra work that comes with endless coupon promotions. I loved my cafe coworkers but no one ever enjoyed being there so shifts were hard to get covered."
good,"From day one manager knew I wanted to work in books. I was told I would be once I trained in Cafe first.  They are cross training, so books can cover Cafe for breaks. Ok, so I took the job."
good,"My store manager was decent, however, he was also a micromanager. The real issue is upper management. They have blanket expectations and it’s just not realistic. Each store is different, destination stores are very different from mall stores, expecting them to operate the same is mind blowing. Pay is horrid. And the company rather you sell memberships than books."
good,Management runs like the new plantation. Work yourself ragged for less than 10 dollars an hour. Less than 17 hours per week most weeks. Never had a full staff unless it was a major holiday. Coworkers and customers were very nice most of the time. Takes a long time to advance into more pay or more hours either one. Not a great choice of job for a single source of income.
good,"I can deal with the angry customers and manual labor present at this job, but where I draw the line is at minimum wage with uptight managers who bully you rather than uplift you half of the time."
good,It was a good job aside from poor management. They also put a lot of pressure to sell memberships and get mad if you aren't pushy whenever interacting with a customer. I enjoyed helping the customers and the only reason I left is that there was one manager who was so rude and threatened to fire me if I didn't get enough memberships even when I was meeting the quota.
good,"If you're accustomed to moving rapidly and working in high-stress environments, this job is a good change of pace. If you're a bookseller, your job is easy but rather boring. If you're a barista in the café, like I am, your job is significantly harder at the same pay rate per hour, but it's much more interesting and ever-changing while also keeping that classic B&N vibe."
good,"The day shifts are enjoyable with a lot of different people to interact with and tasks to do, and depending on the day it can be a very busy  place to work which makes the time go flying. Honestly you can learn a lot just from the interactions with other people. You can learn a vast amount of people skills just by working there which will help in all types of interactions throughout life, so I do feel it is a good place to learn."
good,"I always enjoyed the people I worked with, but the company needs a better relationship with their employees. They have no consideration for quality of living when it comes to pay, and no idea of the amount of work it takes to run their stores. A given task always takes the same amount of man hours to complete, it doesn't matter how many or few people there are working. One person can only complete so much in a given time period."
good,"Barnes and Noble in downtown DC (no longer in business) was a difficult place to work. It kept you on your toes because of it's location. In addition to that, we had so many different personalities to work with on a daily basis that it was hard to know how to approach people. "
good,Started as a barista at the store and didn't get an opportunity to advance.  I wanted to become a bookseller.  I bent over backwards for the company and reaped no rewards. Sad.  The management was always changing and it was hard for anyone to love the store owner.  All other managers on duty were nice and helpful.
good,Too much work with not enough staff. The rules from corporate are completely counter productive. It's a retail job so there's a lot of customer interaction.
good,"Unfortunately, B&N is in a tough place at the moment, 2018 has been a hard year for them and that shows in the store. Most the day is spent doing task from previous days because they are so short staffed and under trained. The Store Mangers spend most the time giving order and doing busy work, but don't help complete the task to get done in a timely manner."
good,"Not somewhere I would want to work forever, but it's a fine part time job. The people are nice and working around books is fun. They were fairly flexible with hours."
good,"This was my first job. Barnes and Noble is slowly dissolving and it's unlikely it will survive as a company much longer. They consistently close stores and throw under qualified management into their remaining stores. If it were not for my previous manager, I would still be employed with the company."
good,"Despite working extra hard, providing exceptional customer service, and running around providing cross coverage to all departments, it didn't matter in the end because all they cared about was number of enrollments in the membership and kids club program."
good,"My co-workers are the only reason working there is worth it. Yes, the discount is a plus, however the pay is barely livable and there is little to no chance for advancement. It's good place to work if you're fresh out of school or need a little something extra but its not somewhere you could stay."
good,"Over the past few years full time employment has become less of a guarantee, with plenty of full time employees being let go without warning. Trying to move up in the company is difficult, and it may take five to ten years before you see any advancement or fulltime employment, or even longer in current climates."
good,"Barnes and Noble is great, you make the best of friends in your coworkers and are all mostly supportive of each other. The issue is the hectic schedule, the inconsistent hours, and the low pay. It is minimum wage and for how often we need people and have to go above and beyond to just make it through I think we deserve more pay."
good,"I worked for Barnes & Noble College so my experience is slightly different and may be exclusive to the store I worked for. Although I was hired as a bookseller I was forced to wear many hats without any extra compensation. I had to be a Starbuck's barista, textbook stocks person, cashier, and merchandiser all in one for a mere $7.25. The hours were also inconsistent."
good,I have always loved books and I love selling books to people. The main problem with the company at large is how it manages time and values profits over people.
good,"Typical day was opening the store, baking, prepping, and display management. Worst part of the job was hands down the management. They treated employees awful, wrecked work when an employee didn't finish on time. Another manager was constantly saying terrible things about almost every employee."
good,"Great employees. The majority of them were very unique individuals are willing to extend their hand in friendship, and guide you to be the best bookseller."
good,"could use a lot of updating, and more professional personnel. overall it is not a bad job, they could pay a little more than they do, but its not bad depending on the gender."
good,Overall Barnes and Noble was ok. Management seemed pretty willing to accommodate my class schedule when I was employed there part-time during college.
good,"The individual employees and managers at Barnes and Noble tend to be very good to work with. However, the company as a whole is very troubled, and is not a good long-term bet. Pay and benefits will not likely rise again, but continue to decline."
good,"If you do a good job they will move you around (if you start in the cafe and get lots of member cards they'll likely move you to book floor)"
good,"Some of the managers are really hard to work with, and how the company handles certain situations are frustrating. I have worked there for 5 years and I still don't really feel valued or that my opinion is heard. They don't schedule people in the department that they are best at."
good,"What it comes down to is this-"
good,"There are many things about Barnes & Noble that make it a lovely place to work - fair breaks and lunches, good training, a great environment, camaraderie coming easily between coworkers, a raise with every good review, paid sick/personal/vacation time (albeit set amounts), and (in my case) flexibility in working with other commitments. However, no one is allowed full-time hours except for those in a Lead or management position, which means no benefits and no relying on a bookseller's position to pay all the bills. "
good,"The retail aspect of the job made it a very stressful working environment. The inconsistent hours also made it quite difficult to maintain a healthy work/life balance. My managers and coworkers made working there worth it, but eventually, the cons personally outweighed the pros."
good,"Be flexible, prepared to be called in.  Must love working with public and dealing with all sorts.  Long, busy holiday hours.  Doesn't help when you have a management team that doesn't pull their weight."
good,"I Loved Barned and Noble as a child, but working there was only about half as great as I expected. I was a college student at the time I applied and they told me they were flexible when I talked to them over the phone but when i came in the tone changed. I was told that work came before my education and if I couldn’t show up I was going to be docked pay and be given a write up. This was fine as my professors were flexible so I agreed to it. I worked there for two or three weeks learning the ropes and It was fun. My co workers were polite and my managers were helpful and courteous. My only gripe with them to be full on honest is the lack of decent flexibility. They would constantly schedule me on hours I couldn’t work and If I couldn’t come in I could call someone else to take my place but most people wouldn’t so I got a few write ups. I like to think I left them with some experience and lessons. Overall great place to work if you don’t care about benefits (usually only want part time) or can put up with lack of flexible schedules."
good,"I enjoyed my time working at B&N for the most part, but there was  the problem of the managers acting very impatient for someone they were training. There was this constant pushing to sell rewards cards, but they never seemed to be happy with just keeping the customer happy despite that being their motto ""What keeps people coming back to us instead of our competitors is great customer service."""
good,The pay was decent and I really liked working with most of the managers except for the head store manager she is a bit too high strung for me to get along with. Working customer service the customers were usually okay but occasionally bad ones.
good,"Long time employees and assistant managers were highly insecure around new, part time, seasonal employees. The job is a piece of cake and can be quite fun if you don't allow their negative attitudes to get to you. The best advice during downtime is to find things yourself to keep busy with as the permanent folks don't like to share tasks & often make mountains out of molehills. Enjoy the customers, most are pretty great. Remember the reasons you are there & maybe one day the manager will re-evaluate who should stay & who really needs to go. We were told during the initial interview process by assistant managers to not say we loved books because no one there gets to read. This was weird because you don't read on any job but a love of books is still a valid reason for wanting to work in a BOOK store."
good,Barnes & Noble likes to tell people to come and work for them if they love books.  In reality it's a typical retail job.  You're just as likely to be stocking toys or working the registers as you are selling books.  If you've ever worked a low-end retail job you know what it's like to work for B&N.
good,"I was there for a short period of time, but it was ""ok."" There is no wow factor about working there unless you're a book connoisseur (which I am). Management was decent."
good,If there's nothing to do or if business is too slow; they start cutting hours which cuts pay and your already making minimum wage so..just keep that in mind
good,"I loved books from a young age so working at a Bookstore was what i always wanted to do. When my location closed due to rental increase, i was voluntold to be the cafe manager because of my previous Starbucks experience. Boy did i miss working with books. I missed being able to help a customer find ""the one with the blue cover"" and knowing the NY times Bestsellers."
good,"I had worked at the Barnes & Noble Cafe for a while. I felt that the Cafe I worked in was having constant managerial issues, and the managers I have had were more focused on selling their product instead of treating customers like fellow human beings. It was a structure that was efficient in making money, but was not the right attitude for me."
good,Working here was not what i expected. I was working here and somewhere else and they were very forceful about making me pick them over my other job. When i was hired i told them i was working another job and that there were certain times i would not be able to work there and they said that it was no problem and they would work with me. That turned out to not be the case. It was only a seasonal job so i wasn't that worried when they didn't ask me to continue on with them.
good,"I worked in the cafe area of barnes for three years. Most of my co workers are my good friends now which was the best part of the job. The cafe manager is good but the lead and the actual managers don't really help the cafe workers much. It's all about sales so if you're good with sales, you'll be good at this job. You have to open and close by yourself and that's very tough. If you're fast-paced and learn things quickly then you should be okay."
good,"been at this job for 9 and half years, this is or has been fun at times but the overall growth is zero level I have train many and yet I haven't moved up myself"
good,"A lot of the issues with this company vary on level of employment. If you can tolerate minimum wage then you can get this job very easily and there isn't much expected from you. However, as you move up, the pay doesn't get very much better, but the responsibility goes up tremendously. A lot of the managers are overworked and stressed. You are not likely to get fired though."
good,"-Fast-paced environment (at times)"
good,"A great job - bookseller or a cafe attendant.  Just a part time gig, don't expect to work up to anything.  Uptight occasionally and you're always being reprimanded no matter how long you've worked there."
good,"I really enjoyed working in the cafe with my coworkers, but the compensation I received, the lack of benefits, and the overall disorganization of the store was too difficult to keep up with."
good,Customer service business with strong corporate values. Managers did recognize hard working employees and find opportunity for promotion for them. Increasingly focused on technology rather than book sales.
good,It isn't an easy job and you must work a lot of hours to get to manager position. It is fun when you work with great team and this not always the case. You must be detected to work and be available  all the time. The pay is very low and you work more than what you earn
good,"This was a retail job but it had more than just the standard cashier, help desk and answer phones that usually encompass a retailer. There was room for advancement, support from management and the company liked to hire from within."
good,The managers there use bullying and negative reinforcement tactics to get their tea m to make goals and complete tasks. The booksellers are nice though.
good,"I miss my Co-workers....and that you got paid weekly, its great place for college students who live at home. or as a second drop to supliment your income."
good,I have worked for BN for 8 years. I have held many positions and been promoted throughout my time there. I have had the opportunity to work in 5 stores and learn different management techniques from different store managers and district managers. Community events are fun and exciting to be a part of.
good,"Great job if you are still in college, not a long term job. Pay is below as well as the benefits. No room for growth and can be tiring at times"
good,This is not an exciting job. There is not a lot of room for advancement. It is a perfect job for high schoolers and college students. It is a low stress job.
good,"I was in charge of the Kids Department, which included a multitude of responsibilities. My typical day included providing excellent customer service, completing company-driven projects, running story time twice weekly, maintaining an organized, fully stocked, and welcoming department for parents and children, and covering breaks for my coworkers at Customer Service, Music, and Cash."
good,"I basically gathered and returned textbook orders, help process payments for orders, and help clean the bookstore after closing time."
good,Love the atmosphere and my coworkers. Certain managers do not have the best approach but out of the 5 only 2 of them are really an issue. Love going to work!
good,"I worker there from October 2014 till December 2014 and I would say that the company itself was in top order they had everything from theft to recovery to shipping and handling all covered. Sadly, due to my hours working there it wasn't the best pay grade. I cannot live off of $99 every week. Maybe if I had a second job which I didn't, but how am I to pay for gas, fix my car when it breaks down, or ven go out on my off days. Impossible! The staff was nice,....most of them. The cafe was always clean and stocked, but the workers seemed to careless what they needed to help me with. Besides everything, I'd give the store 3 stars."
good,"I worked in the cafe and was the one and only male in the department. The cafe manager was pretty much there so she could retire at when the time came. I did my best but only got a small promotion to shift supervisor. Truth is, I ran circles around my boss and she either felt threatened by my efforts or at a loss to give me more credit for the positive changes I was making in the department. In any case, the manager did not like me for whatever reason and made my life awfully difficult."
good,"The slow paced retail environment is ideal for those that want to have a complacent work attitude,  The expectations have become unrealistic since the company is struggling to meet investor expectations.  This causes judgmental and poor decisions amongst store management."
good,Barnes and noble is a good company if you want to be bossed around all day and never move up in the company. They are not family oriented and you mean noting to them when you work there .I worked there in college it was ok.
good,"Great times at barns and Noble Bookstore located on a college campus with wonderful students... my typical day would include checking out students with books purchases. Order and track books, log and stock all orders. Manage all office duties including forwarding all book tracking to upper management."
good,"Poor hours given to part-time employees. Lacking in ability to train new hires. Was told that I would start as bookseller and train to move into receiving role due to previous job experience, never received any kind of training during my 9 months of employment."
good,"A much more laid back environment than retail or food industry, but the bookstore industry is definitely struggling. In order to compensate for the loss, managers put an immense amount of pressure to up-sell and sell a $25 membership to customers. The NOOK devices are constantly malfunctioning and we are always having to solve issues with them. "
good,A typical work day is not so busy but it allows students to work and then also do their personal school work which I like about this job. My co-workers are great because we all can relate to each other because we are all students.
good,I Love all of my coworkers And my Cafe Manager but the overall management was lazy not empathetic bi-polar the whole business itself was not pleasant at all like ever job it had its good and bad days but there was no organization at this job
good,"After just coming upon my six year anniversary with the company I have been having a lot of reflections on what exactly I want from my job. Retail is very difficult work and unfortunately this specific store is not run at its best capabilities. We have changed store managers three times since my two years at this particular location. I worked as an acting manager for a couple months due to the current manager at the time being on maternity leave, with the hope for further advancement, that never happened. I have been at a standstill with the position I am in. Management is just fulfilling their duties from high above, but this tends to trickle down on underpaid and overworked employees who deserve much better. The people I work with are truly amazing and I do feel grateful for the connections I have made."
good,"the workers are very jolly and chill, so are the managers"
good,"This was my first job, typical day was at barnes and noble was unloading all the books from the boxes and putting them in there correct location. Helping customers find their book of interest."
good,"I've been working for B&N for over 2 years now and have been told that I have advanced fast and have what it takes to be a lead in the company but even though there have been positions available they still have yet to promote me. I have given them open availability this whole time because I was under the impression that they were going to use my time, alas I am still a part time employee (because that's what all their booksellers are, the only way to get full time is to become a lead or manager). I'm told they prefer to promote from within but in the time I've been here I've seen 3 new leads hired out right and only 1 promoted. I love my job, it's relaxing and even fun at times but with no room to grow with the company I see no reason to stay when something else is presented."
good,The job was pretty decent. Could have paid better. The management lacked communication. The work schedules were not secure and the hours varied greatly from day to day. The co-workers were mostly decent minus a few. The hardest part of the day was the lunch rush. The easiest part of the day was in the morning.
good,"Start at minimum wage, however they expect you to do way more than what you get paid for. Management was always a mess."
good,This job was a good place to work and the other employees and managers were good people to work with. With this job I gained a little computer experience. I loved interacting with the customers.
good,Great coworkers and after six months you get pto. The pay isn't a good tradeoff though
good,its fast paced all the time but the managers were very lazy as far as pulling their work load
good,"A typical day at work consist of restocking books and assisting customers. I learn a lot of sales, merchandising and marketing tips. Management and co-workers are friendly but need a little more structure and training. The hardest part of the job is not being able to fulfill a request. The most enjoyable part of the job is to find the book that the customer really wants and place it in there hands."
good,"This position is great for a project oriented non sales focused individual. A typical day requires you spending 75% of your day shelving new release books off of carts and setting up new promotions on tables, endcaps and various other fixtures. '"
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is problem solving issues with Nooks and to see customers walk away happy with their product.
good,This was my favorite job as a teenager and I enjoyed the experience
good,"when i had a problem with one of my associates, my manager was extremely unprofessional and in such an i humane manner said “I can’t do anything for you” and i would’ve let it go but my coworker had hidden my purse from me in his locker and all i asked my manager to do was to investigate and she said I’m sorry but your bag is gone. Left me in tears, until my coworker who thought it was funny to hide my purse from me, with my credit cards and license, SS, etc came out and said “oops manybe i hid it in my locker” safe to say i left that same week and never looked back"
good,"As workers my team and I were constantly looked down upon and ridiculed. We did everything we could, put so much blood- sweat- and tears LITERALLY into everything we did. Never was good enough. We deserved better."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was all the coffee you drank. There was no way to get a raise and that was pretty upsetting :(. The environment was pretty lax tho.
good,I worked in the morning receiving books in the stockroom. I mainly worked in the stockroom but had the chance to work in other areas. It gave me the experience to be a salesperson and sell many products we offered in the store.
good,Not enough money to take care of a household. There are not many positions at the company so there's not much room to grow in the company. The job does however teach patience and great customer service.
good,It’s a dying company and cuts employees and treats them like temporary means to an end. Honestly I met some great people and I love books and I enjoyed working there but the company doesn’t care about any of its employees
good,"Very poor communication and a lack of worth. They will pull your hours no questions, including your benefits. I worked very hard for this company, though they say they'll have your back, they won't. You will be thrown under the bus if it means a manager will not get in trouble. Blame is ALWAYS being pushed on others. They do not care about their employees. Advancement within the company is a complete joke.That being said, the other employees are great. to this day I still have friends from Barnes & Noble"
good,"PROS: coworkers, employee discount, typically laid-back workplace, nice customers, above minimum wage"
good,"Loved working with staff and talking about books and movies. The most difficult part of the job was the online pricing of Amazon, but they are adapting to current trends via price matching from BN.com online pricing."
good,"Minimum wage job fantastic for college students trying to make a buck during semesters. If you need an actual decent paying job with decent hours, STAY FAR AWAY. Management is somewhat qualified but standoffish yet micromanaged to the core. I worked there for a few months diligently, then was randomly emailed to not show up again, without a warning."
good,"The atmosphere when I first started was like a family. The people I worked with were kind and there was a great amount of trust from everybody and a great degree of passion for what we did. However recent changes in management and company policy have greatly diminished that feeling. The amount of hours I work now has gone down, but the amount that I am asked to get done within a my shift keeps going up."
good,"Overall, working for B&N was alright. It was very fast paced in the beginning as students are trying to buy their textbooks but it slows down after a month. Management was not the best, they like you one day and don't like you the next."
good,"Depending on your store's management team and District manager, the experience working here can vary greatly. If you have a good management team the job can be very rewarding and you have the opportunity to impact your community.  If you have a poor management team or DM, it can be extremely disheartening frustrating to work here."
good,"-Help customers find the books they are searching for, order the books they can not find. "
good,"A couple months ago we got all new management brought into the store and the manager I was super cool with left and the place is not the same since then. Schedules make no sense and are pretty bad for everyone including my supervisor, seasonal hires are paid the same as myself with years of café experience, and the management did nothing when I asked for more hours."
good,"They counted all the customers I had including current member holders as missed opportunities to get a new member. The numbers were against me. And they criticized me for having organic conversation with customers. I'm best at providing a friendly environment, not pushing sales of items for people who don't need them."
good,Honestly the company seems ok. The pay wasn’t terrible. But the work/life balance was a joke. When I made a complaint I was told I chose this position and that’s what I had to deal with. Management was sloppy and inconsistent. They offered to train and then throw one into the fire without so much as a blink. My entire experience was disappointing and stressful.
good,The company has some of the best and talented workers in the business. There can be stressful times here as with any job. One will find that work-life balance can be a challenge depending on the department. The employees love the company and are dedicated to keeping the company alive.
good,"Overall it is a pretty chill and cool place to work as a start off position or just a job to pass the time. Good people, all friendly with a mix between older and younger workers. Managers are all friendly and good with communication."
good,"If you have worked any sort of retail then you will understand what working for Barnes and Noble is like. The hardest part of the job is having to deal with customers that will yell at you for the slightest reason. But if you have a passion for books, you will find ways to cope. Ultimately it depends on your store location. Some stores will be better run than others, and some stores will have more competent managers than others."
good,"making money is the bottom line. selling membership cards and upselling titles are what drives the business. just like any retail job, you deal with good and bad customers. the company has shifted from a book selling company to just making money and sometimes by any means. cutting hours and positions has become the new norm."
good,Working hard and being loyal to the company didn't keep them from eliminating my position and going to a business model with very few full time employees.
good,"In addition to engaging customers and selling product, there is always plenty to do for someone who takes initiative.  If you are a lead or in a management position , the assignments are set and dessiminated by corporate headquarters.  In the alternative, you can volunteer for some projects.  The projects are varied:  some labor intensive tasks, others requiring  skill in creatively merchandising product or rectifying discrepancies  in inventory numbers.  You can clean when foot traffick is slow.  So, if you appreciate variety  in the workplace,  it delivers.  The hardest part of the job is that it can be physically taxing to be at attention and up on your feet for 7.5 hours.  The breaks are inadequate. You get a half hour for lunch  and a 15 minute break that most people forget to take and the managers will not remind you.  The most enjoyable part...customers!  You must have a robust appreciation  for people  and their  humanity."
good,"I have worked a lot of awful customer service jobs, this one is pretty ok. I don’t find myself struggling to leave the house for work everyday or really counting down the hours until I leave. It’s another retail job. Nothing more nothing less. "
good,"Do not work here. Again do work here. I have met some great people working here. Now, you are a college student looking for a discount for textbooks then maybe work here just for the discount its 30 percent off textbooks."
good,"Once upon a time, BN was a great bookstore to work at.  Then along came digital and it was never the same.  All of the high-pressure sales pitches, salary freezes, position reductions seem to have flowed directly from the failed attempt at being a hardware creator."
good,"Being that I previously worked at starbucks, I figured a “starbucks” with no drive thru would turn out to be a good thing. After being trained in less than a month, I close by myself three times a week. Its stressful managing daily tasks completely alone and having to deal with customers. Unlike most, the customers here were the nicest thing about the store. Coporate loves to pin us against one another: “whoever sells the most venti fraps gets a raise” and it makes it difficult to enjoy work. "
good,"I was a bookseller here for quite sometime and it was busy but i was consistently out where I asked not to be. The job is lonely and rushed, customers can also be quite rude on sunday mornings."
good,"I am currently working at B&N, about 20 hours a week. The pay is better than other retail jobs I've had and the environment is mostly fairly laid back when on the bookfloor and mildly busy at the cafe most days. We have a fairly diverse workplace and mostly open-minded people, if that's what you look for."
good,"I truly enjoyed working at Barnes and Noble. I had the opportunity to hold various roles such as cashiering and customer service. If I were to go in for the first shift, there would be a short meeting about the upcoming day, and there would be a closing meeting if I were to work the closing shift. The management at the time was unstable and there was much miscommunication from some managers and a lack of encouragement/support which made it become an environment that grew to be less enjoyable. The coworkers were great to be around and since I worked with typically older coworkers, they were able to provide much guidance and support when managers were lacking. The hardest part of the job was the pressure put on employees to succeed at particular tasks, and the most enjoyable part was building relationships and trust with customers which strengthened my communication skills immensely."
good,"A typical day consists of paying invoices, but sometimes varies as to publishers and cafe vendors. Over time, that has remained stable while I have also taken on more duties."
good,"I originally got the job because I loved books. It was my first job, and I didn't think I would leave until after college. The first few years were great, but as of 2017 a lot of things changed. The company began to move in a direction that was more based on selling. Which is fine, but they were unwilling or unable to provide the staff necessary to make what they wanted to happen actually happen. Staff were required to only ""sell"" to customers during most of the workday. No putting away products, cleaning, or even standing at the customer service desk for too long. When the shipment came in, you weren't allowed to touch it until after 4pm when the store closed at 10, and they wanted it all done by 8 or 9. This would all be with two employees working on the floor on a good day. On top of cleaning the entire store, selling to customers, and answering phones, one person had to do all of the shipment. It got out of control. Add in apathetic management that didn't want to help with anything, only complain about how difficult their jobs were while sitting down and texting, and it wasn't an easy place to work. I still love Barnes & Noble. If things had been better, I would have stayed. But it wouldn't be possible now."
good,"Barnes and Noble is a fun place to work if you enjoy reading. Most employees are nice, and good to chat with. The only downside was pay. Raises are yearly, and only 10 cents. If you don't like helping people find things or recommending book/movies/music to people, this business is not for you."
good,"The company struggles with high turnover and inability to give workers the hours they need. Stores are closing at an alarming rate, and I would not recommend seeking employment there."
good,"When I started working at Barnes & Noble, I was excited to work for a company that seemed to work hard to create a positive experience for both customers and employees. But over the last decade, I've seen staff, hours, and benefits get cut and positions be eliminated. The company is clearly trying to do the same amount of work with fewer employees, which leaves everyone stressed and unhappy. We all do the best we can, and most of the time, customers appreciate that. I have the privilege of working with some great people, and when things are running smoothly, everyone is happy. Ultimately, it's retail, so the kind of day you have depends a lot on the customers. Just be prepared to hear a lot of people say ""I'll just order it off Amazon."""
good,It’s a fun job and I loved it. However we kept getting laid off. They called me back numerous times but it wasn’t enough for me to stay. I needed something more steady.
good,Barnes and Noble has been in drastic decline over the last year. In the last 12 month 5 management lead positions were eliminated from our store. This January a couple thousand people were laid off. The company is only worried about taking care of investors. Employees job stability and career growth are gone.
good,"Slow and easy work, sometimes managers picked favorites. I really only quit because I worked there for three years and never got a raise while pretty much everyone I trained got a raise. The different departments kept work interesting, and everyone liked each other."
good,"The hours were flexible for a college student,  it was very nice. Management was highly disorganized, from the four years that I worked there I had roughly 10 different managers, I did work at a big store, but still it shouldn't be that many new managers. The pushing of memberships is honestly why I left."
good,"work at cafe, great manager, great people, love my employees, love that we are like a family, just sometimes it get stressful, and hectic and you get no help, they are sometimes cutting hours so , would like to at least work longer hours"
good,Barnes & Noble does not treat their employees well. They understaff and underpay. Upper management is often weak. For example the District Manager in Indiana is disrespectful and unwilling to help or support her employees. It was common knowledge that one ASM at the Lafayette store was abusing her employees and multiple reports were made to HR. The DM ignored all complaints and lost half a dozen employees due to her neglect. The ASM recently left and many of the employees have returned to the store.
good,"Barnes and Noble is a standard retail environment.  A typical day is comprised of shelving books, working at the cash register and customer service. The workplace culture is fine, but with the understanding that each store is working against the tide of Amazon shuttering bookstores.  The biggest issue is management. If your store manager is not the greatest, that tends to trickle down to every other level.  The hardest part of the job is probably the wild disparities between slow times and busy times. The most enjoyable part is probably just being surrounded by books."
good,"My specific experience was slightly strained due to things outside of the company's hands.  It was a fun place to work.  In the cafe, it was extremely fast paced, never a dull moment.  The best thing was getting to know the regulars and taking care of them.  The hardest part of the job was sometimes trying to do too many tasks and still try to serve the customer properly due to low payroll hours."
good,"Overall a great environment of people working at Barnes and Noble. Either really busy or really slow, no in between. I was only a temporary employee so it was a good few weeks working there."
good,"The organizational culture is not maintained throughout the entire organization, some locations are much better places to work compared to others. Moreover, there are favoritism by management as it pertains to their employees, some employees tend to be more valued than others. Employees at a lower level are treated as assets rather than humans, and there is a lack of diversity higher up the hierarchy. Nevertheless, the company is very adaptive to their external environment, and uphold a positive reputation among their business partners and vendors."
good,"Good place to start a first job at. I have now 4 years of customer service/retail experience. Management was very pushy on selling memberships, and I decided to step down from head cashier. Being part time I am given very little hours, but this job is to help pay my way through school until I can advance into my future career."
good,workplace culture has become difficult but not necessarily through the fault of the management and more due to the evolving sales culture. The management has to deal with a lot of the stress that trickles down to the lower employees. Its not their fault but the stress is felt on all levels.
good,Barnes and Noble is a nice place to work if you are just looking for a job to supplement your income. The other employees are usually fun to work with. Management is very lax and not into taking new ideas for advancing the store's growth. Career advancement is hardly an option. But all and all not a bad place to work.
good,"Management does not provide equal treatment for employee's. No room for advancement."
good,"While managers vary, I have been blessed to work with a really kind management team who takes employee advancement seriously. It was not always so; at the first store I worked in, I was always promised training that I never received that made me lose out on a promotion. I toughed it out and have been promoted twice in the last two years. I was not impressed when corporate did not match employee pay to adjust for minimum wage inflation. While I'm pro-minimum wage increase, I felt slighted by losing the percentage over minimum wage that I had been making. Bad move on corporate. Now I only make a measly dollar above minimum wage despite the promotions and the four years I've given to this job. "
good,There is a lot of pressure to force the memberships and the email collection. I believe that a bookstore as well known as B&N should focus more on the prosperity of books and the enjoyment of books and popular media throughout a community instead of having competitions to see how many people you can get to buy the somewhat lackluster membership program. I feel that B&N should reinforce the beauty and importance of reading instead of trying to squeeze money out of customers. I get that B&N is a large company trying to make money but I think that the executives could take a little bit of a pay cut to satisfy the disgruntled employees and customers.
good,Amazing place to work for a booklover.  Corporate strategy is unfocused having four CEO's in the last Five years. It can be a challenging environment when the direction is constantly shifting.
good,Would be the most amazing job if not for the overbearing and aggressive selling culture for the membership program. The staff and the customers are wonderful but the management hierarchy leaves a lot to be desired. Unfortunate that such a great job for book lovers gets suffocated by corporate politics.
good,Clean work environment; staff was friendly; always busy. An inviting atmosphere. Management was not too clear on duties. Training was minimal mostly a hands on training.
good,A typical day is non stop standing and moving for 8 hours. You learn fast and learn most things as you go. Coworkers are helpful and friendly. Store management was interesting but currently have new management and there are signs of a better environment for employees.
good,"Positive and friendly associates and work atmosphere. Backward growth momentum. Poor technology and adaptation to current cultures, ideas and lifestyles."
good,"My love of reading made this an easy place to work. The interaction with customers was an added plus. Management and the staff was a good mix of people at the store that I worked . The hardest part if the job was the cleanup at night . Best part of the job was getting advanced copies of books, the management style as well as a great employee discount."
good,"I absolutely loved my job at the Barnes and Noble Cafe, I loved the regulars, my coworkers and most of all coffee! But management made it too hard to stay, there was a lot of obvious favoritism and bullying on the manager's part."
good,"No accountability for crumbling infrastructure. Nice people, but Amazon.com inspired B&N to run a paper thin staff and expect the same service as a full crew."
good,"The thing I love about Barnes and Noble is that the managers treat you with respect and consideration. And Coworkers are always well rounded friendly and compassionate people. The negatives of the job are that you can't do full time unless you have a supervisory position so getting hours is hard and everyone winds up having to work 2 or 3 jobs. Also the pay is really low considering all of the information that you have to learn, how experienced you are, and the fact that most employees have college degrees."
good,"Came in, had a pre-shift meeting did daily operations of a barista. Assisted customers with coffee and food orders. Managers were great if they liked you, not so much if they didn't. Co-workers were fun and chatty. The hardest part of the job was trying to deal with the horrible pay and live a comfortable life. Most enjoyable part of the job was the customers that came back everyday and getting to meet such great like minded people."
good,the position as bookseller its very easy it requires nothing more than geting the textbook as well as prices and sometimes you may run into a challenge. Your customer service skills have to be on point cause you may deal with a irritate customer but over all its a pretty cool job
good,"The environment can be fast-paced and the management are very dedicated to get their sales numbers up, sometimes to the detriment to the worker relationship with the other sale associates. But it is a book store after all. The pay is low, but normal for a retail store and the hours to work are not plentiful, again, not uncommon for a retail store."
good,It is a high stress work environment. They expect a lot for little pay but the co-workers and customers are fun to be around.
good,"Working at the bookstore has been one of my favorite experiences in my young adult life. I wish I could say I was happy working here, unfortunately the management is disorganized and unprofessional."
good,"I worked for B&N when this type of store was a fairly new concept.  For about 4 years I loved my job as the Community Relations Manager (before 9/11).  After that, it was all about the money. You will work with some great people.  I found the store management to be pretty good, but upper management clueless and focused on unimportant minutia rather than really helping their store staffs.  Enjoy working here while you are young or are in a position to just do it part-time."
good,"Barnes & Noble was a very fun place to work at. It attracts a certain type of employee, which makes it even  better. Management was incredibly poor, with horrible management styles. The DM encouraged the Store & Merchandise Managers to a hands off approach, which created many angry customers and employees, especially during rush hours. "
good,"Management was inefficient, combative, and retaliatory.  Would pit workers against each other, and would ignore rather than address employee's concerns, even if these concerns regarded sexualharassment, and other types of harassment."
good,Barnes and Noble is the last of a dying industry. They don't pay their employees very well and they expect them to have completely open schedules. Only good if you really love books and can handle corporate mismanagement.
good,A day at my job is a very busy and energetic environment filled with UPenn students and UPenn employees. As a bookseller you handle one on one questions directly from customers and given a limited time to respond with a pleasant personality. I love it!! The afternoon is our busiest part of the day because that's when students and employees are either on class breaks or lunch breaks. I love the afternoon store rush with customers because you learn fast problem solving skills based on how you handle multiple questions by customers. Plus it makes my work day go by fast.
good,At work I assisted the college students and regular customers in finding books that they would enjoy reading or needed for school. Co workers were nice and friendly. Hardest part of the job was sometimes finding the books because of the great volume of reading material that was there.
good,"Fun place to work, but don't try to move up the ladder.  More responsibility does not mean more pay or compensation. blah blah blah blah blah blah blah"
good,This job is a great job for college student they work with your school schedule. The management are great with balancing your school schedule and making sure you have a little cash in your pocket.
good,"Fun place to work with entertainment media.  Challenging atmosphere whenever dealing with the public, trying to fill any request.  Not much advancement opportunity as is typical of the retail sales environment."
good,I was often the only person running the place most of the time. it was a nice environment but often got too busy for one person.
good,"I was a Cafe Porter. It was an easy job on paper but it had it's share of hectic fast paced moments,which I learned to adapt to so I guess that's a plus.  Some of the co-workers were great and fun to be around."
good,"A typical day was making sure the books were in stock for the students to purchase. If not to try to find it for them or advise them where to purchase it. The management was great. The most enjoyable part was converting with the customers. But most of all balancing the drawer at the end of the shift and counting the safe, making the drop and checking balances. This lets me know I have completed my job efficiently!"
good,"I worked here for two summers, the job was only temporary, basically for about a month. Worked the cash register as well as fulfilled customer orders for text books. Took customer calls and helped them out with questions they had about certain products etc."
good,"Though they do not pay well, or provide any benefits, they treat their employees well. They do not look hard for full time employees unless absolutely necessary, however they are a struggling business so that much should probably be expected. The managers are nice and treat the employees fairly."
good,Very friendly customers and a very quiet and decent place to work at. You get to learn about how selling works and how to organize books. The most enjoyable part of this job is talking to your customers who come from all around the world.
good,"Each year, payroll hours are reduced more and more.  Store employs less than half the staff it did 10 years ago.  Until recently, part-time employees could receive benefits, but the company discontinued them about 2 years ago."
good,"Every day I walked into work I would be unsure of what challenges would be faced in our busy little bookstore cafe. After learning the complete ins and outs of my job at  Barnes and Noble I was thrown an opportunity. My manager and my lead quit at the same time in the beginning of the summer of 2014. The company promoted me to lead  and split an assistant store manager (bookstore side) between the store and the cafe, leaving the two of us to manage the cafe. In this time I learned the details of inventory, waste, placement of orders, recorded training of employees to company guidelines and processing of our expenses. I had the full support of my team and was able to motivate them to drive sales and promotions, receiving accolades and achievements from regional and district level employees. Often times though, a company directive would come in telling us to create a display that we wouldn't have the means to create or to perform a practice we were not staffed to do, during peak periods. In these situations there would be a disagreement on how to proceed among managers and multiple employees would be told multiple ways to go about solving the problem. This led to confusion and redundancies, cutting down our productivity and dampening our morale. This along with very low opportunities for advancement or full time employment for my employees would make it sometimes difficult to motivate the team. That being said I always walked into work with a smile on my face, knowing that I would be able to keep up a relentless pace and laugh with my friends on both sides of the counter ( coworkers"
good,"My typical day consists of taking care of book fair details (marketing, wish lists, correspondence, etc.), community outreach, and assisting colleagues and booksellers."
good,"Organization and customer service skills were key to working efficiently in this work environment.  Becoming keen and knowledgeable on popular authors, books and themes not only helped customers but motivated me to read more.  I met some of the most kind and passionate managers who treated the mostly younger staff members fairly and with the upmost respect.  If a co-worker was finished organizing their section and helping customers they almost always lent a helping hand to others.  Not all customers respected the merchandise and so organizing and cleaning up after them could be a messy and time consuming process.  Whenever I would enter the bookstore I would get excited about being there.  There is just something magical about being surrounded by books, creativity, knowledge and masterpieces."
good,"I assist customers daily whether it's ordering books, calling other stores for customer's orders. I also assist customers with finding items within the store. I also stock inventory and assist in other areas of the store as needed."
good,Its a pretty easy job to do. Talking to the regulars was what I enjoyed the most. Since you are in a small section you do get to know your co-workers really well.
good,Very complicated operational procedures which led to loss of employee engagement.  They got away from typical book selling and veered off in too many directions.  I loved developing employees but had no support from higher management.  Culture changed drastically from the time I started to the time I left.
good,"It's a nice place to work. You acquire a wealth of skills. Also, the company culture is creates a very productive work environment."
good,"Every day was definitely different than the previous. I had the most amazing co-workers. Management, not so much. What I really took away from this job was appropriately handling yourself during difficult customer service situations."
good,"Funb place to work. Surrounded by books, tons of knowledge, and discounts on products from every department including cafe, music/dvds, and books on the floor."
good,"Work isn't that bad, but they want you to be able to work at a very fast pace without much real training, Membership goals and other duties are put above all else, and hours aren't scheduled the way they should be. With this, it is difficult to get a task done in the time allotted, and customer traffic consumes most of your time. Management fails to communicate with each other, and employees, effectively, as they have specific tasks they must accomplish. There is no sense of discipline if someone shows up late, calls in rampantly, or doesn't meet shelving/customer service standards. As such, most work that is supposed to be done in the evening hours isn't usually done, and the morning crew has to try to make up for it, as well as get their days work done. Working with customers and the company discount is great."
good,flexible work ours although have to listen to students complain about prices
good,"not enough hours, no benefits. pretty easy job once i figured out how to do everything. everyone o worked with was cool. managers were really nice as well."
good,This place is not only books but entertainment. There are endless supplies of toys .They sell Starbucks products.
good,People were friendly and helpful when needed during back to school periods.
good,"Fun work environment, mean management. No opportunity for growth, no raises."
good,"This job was very knowledgable. I learned alot while working here, read alot of books. Coworkers were great! "
good,A typical day is helping customers with questions and general stocking of merchandise.
good,The people I work with are great and the management team very supportive. Spend the whole shift on your feet. Never enough time to finish all the necessary projects.
good,"It's an interesting and busy place to work during buy back and at the beginning and the end of the semester. I learned a lot in the area of fulfilling online book and merchandise orders, Oracle and multitasking of all kinds."
good,"I learned so many things while working with the company; I can honestly say all I know about retail, I learned at Barnes and Noble. My co-workers have been great--every one of them. Management doesn't care enough, and sadly the location I've worked at for nearly five years is closing down. Management isn't great, and the District Manager has been simply awful. I've worked full-time hours for years, but am considered part-time, with no benefits. The most enjoyable part of the jobs has to be the people. Customers and co-workers alike. There is nothing better than doing my job the best I can and bringing a smile to someones face."
good,It was an enjoyable learning experience. They have a good training schedule and are extremely organized. They ensure that the work flows smoothly
good,"This position was not a difficult one. Part time work, cashiering, restocking. Not a bad position but not enough compensation."
good,"Work isn't complicated, management expects a lot from employees. The hiring process is pretty relaxed depending on the location."
good,"Interesting being a Customer Service Rep, learned how things went behind the counter. From accepting deliveries to selling the products."
good,Barnes and Noble is a great place for getting a part-time job. You will learn customer service skills and an understanding of the book industry. There is no longer health insurance for part-time workers. The managers are fair and will work with you on a reasonable work hours.
good,"A typical day at work involves cleaning up the store, greeting customers, organizing books, and selling the Nook tablet."
good,"I am a very honest person so... working there was very boring, they had me at one register most of the day. When the opportunity arose to do something else i would be the first to participate in getting it done. It was my second job so i learned a lot staying there about life and how everything isn't sun shine and rainbows and that a job like that is not were you want to settle and that is why school is so important. Management was good. My co-workers took time to get used to but they were alright. The hardest part of the job was the standing in one spot for almost 8 hours its tough on the knees and very boring. I am a very active person tell my to go up ten flights of stairs to hand someone a paper and I'm all for it. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be the comics i would read during my break."
good,"Once apon a time I enjoyed my job. There have been many changes in policy and management staffing that I feel have not been beneficial to the running of a customer service centered brick and mortar retail environment. This is not a negative reflection on any one store, but a result of corporate decisions that are not good for the individual stores. Market changes, including the growing popularity of e-readers, are also threatning my work place security."
good,Barnes and Noble has a very diverse and calm work environment. The sole purpose is to keep the customers happy. Theres isn't too much room for advancement.
good,"Barnes & Noble is a company undergoing changes externally and internally.  It is overall, a decent place to work.  They need to offer flexile work arrangements"
good,"Book lovers will be happy. Nice environment to work. You will however be on your feet for your entire shift which can be tiring."
good,"I really enjoyed this job but I knew it would be temporary. I really liked my boss and helping customers find the products they were looking for. The culture there wasn't the best, but I made the best of it. The hardest part of the job was the compensation. The best part were the books and the customers I provided the service of helping to locate the books they wanted."
good,"Like with bookselling, there is an almost ridiculous amount of quotas you must keep track of. But this is likely because bookstores tend to not get as many sales as other places. I don't plan to be here long term, but getting experience as a barista is cool (though I would like to work at a clothing store after this)."
good,"Bookseller position is not for everyone, but can be a great job if it fits your personality. There’s many roles to fill, so it was hard to get bored. I also set my schedule preferences and set two days each week to have off which gave me some reliability for my schedule."
good,"It's a fun environment, but the pay is absolute garbage. It would be nice to actually have a decent wage to live on, but with the new CEO we're all hoping things will change for the better soon."
good,"i had great coworkers and boss. sometimes it could get hectic but nothing i couldn't handle. i enjoyed learning , i was trained really well by great people. you gotta learn how to be professional at all times even with bad customers"
good,I wouldn’t recommend Barnes and noble to anyone. They give nothing to there employees and expect more and more as the company goes down hill. Instead of cutting corners on how much the stores have in dead stock they demand the world from minimum wage employees.
good,"Unless you can snag a full-time position, working at Barnes and Noble should be a supplemental or for fun (legitimate). The workforce usually weeds out incompetent and asocial employees, so the environment between coworkers is open and comfortable. Management listens to personal complaints, as for professional complaints and suggestions, management cares more about upselling rather than upkeep of the store, and getting the job done effeciently. Overall it's up to the part time people to care about what the store looks like until the higher ups show their face"
good,"Working for this company used to be great util they changed there business model, things have been extremely tough in my position as well as the retail stores"
good,"No persons that is pursing a degree or starting a business should consider working retail for long.  Low pay, poor hours for entry level will bring down morale.  Pay does go up significantly at management level, but salary roles will spend a minimum of +45 hours on location."
good,"Experience and customer reviews were not taken into account when given reviews of performance. Working as a team was always talked about, but never implemented."
good,"Slow paced environment, can have it's rushes during events or the holidays. Pay is decent but not great. Great discounts on books and music. Overall relaxed job."
good,The workers at Barnes and Noble are interesting to get to know and incredibly committed to their jobs. Management is often not as involved as they should be and is usually unsupportive.
good,You gain efficient communication skills through the everyday interaction you have with clients as a bookseller or barista. It is always either really slow or very fast paced so always be ready for anything.
good,"good place to work, my location wasn't doing to well but that was mostly do to overstocking on products that weren't selling which was mostly the decisions from HQ"
good,"Sadly was let go after not even completing training but the job was not hard at all it's extremely simple baking, making drinks/food, using a very complex register"
good,it was a fine place to work. Mangament isnt great but the workis easy and as long as you do what your told you will do just fine. The coworkers are amazing.
good,"when getting a part time job at the cafe at barnes and nobles, understand you wont be able to live off that unless you are in high school living with your parents"
good,"If you're looking for a place to earn some pocket money and you genuinely love books, B&N could work great for you. However, it's not a place where I'd tell someone they could build a career. And this is largely due to how obsessed they are about Booksellers getting people to open up memberships. Your whole job essentially rides on your sales performance with those stupid memberships. If you don't have a good weekly quota, you either eventually get let go or if you're a temp hire, then they don't keep you on."
good,"Most of the shift was helping guests find books and attempting to shelve books. Nothing that was asked of us was difficult, but without the support of corporate it was getting harder and harder to do our jobs with the same amount of love and care that we wanted to. Most of the management staff had out back and were very supportive but there were always one or two that were very micromanaging."
good,"Barnes and Noble is a corporate structured company and it limits the additional input from employees for better moral and work environment. Barnes and noble offers advancement opportunities, but has recently removed some positions that were advancement position so now there is limited advancement and no incentive."
good,"I worked in the Cafe. I enjoyed the work for the most part. The Cafe Manager was exceptional when I worked there. They were extremely understanding as an individual, and tried to be fair to everyone. The Cafe manager also gave everyone a chance to be candid with them, and wanted to make sure everyone was comfortable in his/her position in the Cafe. This is the only reason I gave any stars to the ""Management"" portion."
good,"Started great, but corporate management took a dive and the company shifted it's focus from customer service to sales and became unbearable. They cut our staffing so severely that those of us left were forced to do three times the work, with twice the expectations and goals, but with the exact same pay. The district management made unrealistic demands with no support or advice on how to achieve the goals demanded. The company cannot keep up with the market and will flounder at their current pace."
good,Store usually stayed pretty busy and there were people in & out all day so the time went by faster.  Always something to be working on. Being on a college campus made for an enjoyable work environment.
good,"B&N at the start was great; it was a bookstore. But the company has attempted to make itself a brick-and-mordor (that's intended) one-stop shop for all kinds of media and educational traps. That is, it was more important for us to sell memberships and expensive educational toys than it was to find the book the customer was looking for. Policies only validated customer arrogance and entitlement; employees are not protected, they are easily replaceable."
good,"I've worked at a Barnes & Noble for about 5 and a half years now, first as a bookseller, then as a cafe server. My issues with the job may be limited to my location alone, but while I had a great time in the first three years of my employment, my experience has slowly gone downhill in the last two. The hours are inconsistent, I make less money than new hires with no experience (to which they claim they ""can't do anything about it""), and the store is constantly understaffed, making the customers angry and the employees stressed. The management does not care about the cafe at all, to the point where we've started calling ourselves the ""black hole"" of the store. If the store was adequately staffed, I was making more money, and the management cared a little more, I would call this a good job, but all I can say is that for a retail/service gig, it isn't unbearable. Would recommend to high school or college students who need a nice place to work for spending money. Would not recommend if you have issues with anxiety/working in a fast-paced environment."
good,The lack of open positions foe full time employment will deter many from seeking a career with Barnes and Noble. Many positions for management have wages posted as the bare minimum. The skills you learn can be helpful in other more rewarding careers. Best place for a stepping stone rather than a destination job.
good,"To keep competitive with online book retailers B&N has moved away the classic 'bookseller' who was knowledgeable and enthusiastic readers, to people who can just sell without any prior knowledge or interest. This has changed the corporate culture and the culture of individual stores."
good,Okay place to work but needs more pay and more hours management was very good to the workers very understanding and fair workplace was kind of stressful
good,"Barnes and Noble is going through a tough time right now. They recently erased all their full time positions and let go the employees except store and assistant managers. Corporate seems to think it's reasonable to spread part-time employees more thinly across more work with wider responsibilities and still operate efficiently, but it's not working."
good,"Barnes & Nobles is great place to work. The problem is they give you a lack of hours, when they promise you a certain amount every week. They give people hours who don't want to work. Book floor is dead most of the time, but the cafe' is always busy. This is where I worked. The problem with the company is the prices and the lack of deals on their products. Staff is always low. But it doesn't really matter to the fact that most people don't purchase anything."
good,"B&N depends so much on the store management and co-workers; it can be the best place to work, or the worst. All the normal retail pros and cons are there; hours change seasonally and are dependent on sales, you can get some really terrible customers, and the corporate overhead (do two people's workload in half the time!) sucks. If you love books or music or cafe, then apply--you'll benefit from the culture and make some great friends. If you don't, then run...the retail part of it will suck your soul and you will end up bitter & miserable. That sounds like a joke, but it's actually the truth."
good,"Working at the BN college bookstore at the NOVA campus was my first job. It was a great place to learn the ins and outs of retail, as well as customer service."
good,The book industry a place where you can find an assortment of strange and wonderful co-workers. Weird situations that crop up and have your creativity tested daily. Where your schedule can change from one thing to another in a single day. And of course a steadily declining clientele that is aging every day. In other words this business model is slowly disappearing.
good,"A typical day at Barnes & Nobles is helping students get their books for class. Putting back books that students didn't want. Helping new co-workers that need help. Doing returns and buybacks for the students that were returning books. I learned how to do shipping and receiving, which I didn't know how to do. The workplace was very laid back, quiet. To be honest, their really wasn't any hard part of this job, maybe except inventory. This job was pretty self explanitory."
good,"The pay is low and the hours are long except after the holidays when they cut everyone's hours drastically.  There are never enough people to help and always too much to do.  Typical retail job.  However, the people you work with are amazing."
good,"When good, the management were fellow bibliophiles.  When bad, the management came from other retail jobs that did NOT lend themselves to book selling.  My last store manager did not even know who wrote ""Hamlet"" and I think only read sports magazines."
good,If you plan on working at Barnes & Nobles then prepare for a fun time. I would describe it has a normal cashier and service job. You get paid a high salary but it is always busy during certain days.
good,Fast Paced environment with scheduled timeline duties that require very detailed oriented activities. Management is company culture focused. People are friendly Meeting the timeline are very difficult but possible.
good,"If you go to the Mount in Emmitsburg, this is not a good job to do. It is hard due to the slow pace and constant need to find things to do. It is simultaneously frustrating and hard."
good,"Barnes and Noble is a company that looks for and achieves results, by offering employees expectations and coaching on a regular basis. They have daily meetings with the staff reviewing successes and opportunities of meeting sales needs."
good,"They pay so far below other employers, but honestly the job is ridiculously easy. It's impossible to get fired, so sometimes you have to work with people who are slightly unpleasant or who don't care. But it's very slow paced, standards are really low. If you don't need money, and you just want to fill hours in your day and you don't mind having a lot of time to think, it's not terrible. Most of management just seems bored, and they don't care very much."
good,"Had the pleasure of working with this company for a very long time. This was my first real job so I learned a great deal working with amazing staff and management to create a productive workplace. The only thing I will say is that opportunities for advancement are rare to come by. The work hours can be sometimes almost less than 10 hours. I did work in a Barnes and Noble on a college campus so there wasn't a huge influx of customers. The work flow is not too stressful but it can be when school semester starts. I loved the staff I worked with. Management could be difficult to work with sometimes but all in all as long as work is done and numbers are good, there should be nothing to worry about. Salary could improve for staff."
good,Working for the American's largest bookseller was extraordinary. I had the privilege to experienced such a diverse environment in Barnes & Nobles with minimal experience. I was conducting two part-time employment at the time both rewarding at the end of my employment. I love taking action and finding solutions for the staff and for the public sector.
good,"Management is disorderly, and they always mess up the schedule. There are always holes in the schedule that we have to fill with 2 hour notice. Most customers are very friendly and enjoyable, and the Cafe manager is the only one who knows what she's doing."
good,nothing to say. it was a job and seasonal at that ok. I hate doing this part o here. a typo. owelp.why do u insist on people doing this. it takes up time I could be using for a job search.
good,At Barnes and Noble i was mainly a cashier and i learned only about working the registers.I also learned about customer service and successfully making transactions.
good,"Discount and staff cannot be beat. At the corporate level, leadership changes so often that there is no comprehensive strategy that is communicated to stores. This company seems to avoid firing bad leadership at all cost. In stores, there is an excellent culture, very collaborative. Few opportunities to advance at the managerial level because nobody leaves--this can be good and very bad! Fun place for a part-time position, would avoid building a career here."
good,"I worked here during college and although they were accommodating to my college class schedule, this was not the best place to work.  The other employees were amazing."
good,The job was a pretty fun job to start with when you're starting out in the working world. Outside of that I didn't get much else from my employment. So if this a job for anyone that is adding on for their job history.
good,"As long as you are looking for advancement, you would like Barnes and Noble.  I took the ASM position as a step down from my previous company, but when a new DM and SM came around it was unheard of to them."
good,the management at barnes and noble left much to be desired. However the work was enjoyable and made the difference. I liked making coffee and Enjoyed getting to interact with customers on a regular basis enough to put up with scheduling and stocking issues from the management.
good,"Barnes and Noble on the whole is trying it's best to survive Amazon as it continues to monopolize every market, and for that I am grateful. The methods for doing so, however, are generalized across every B&N store, and do not succeed in areas with a fixed and unusual demographic such as ours had. Expectations are unreasonable and put the entire staff under extreme stress, resulting in poorer customer service which of course spirals downward rather quickly. That being said, if you have a great management team, which I did, internally everyone is able to find some sort of balance and make things work. It just makes it near impossible for any of us to impress higher ups and Corporate- who have all become rather detached and unaware of what working in the store level is like. If Corporate allowed their store managers to be flexible with their demands of each store, B&N would likely see a more desired results."
good,Snotty students would likely be the hardest part of the job. Very fast paced environment. My good memory was very helpful. I learned how to handle incoming stock.
good,"Honestly, I worked there so long ago, that I don't really remember specifics. Nothing sticks out in my mind, beside the lackluster management. So yeah, not a terrible place to be, but not great."
good,I really enjoyed shelving books and helping customers find what they needed.  I also enjoyed learning about bringing in inventory and how to rotate and stock products.  I was not a huge fan of one of the managers who didn't like me and made helping customers difficult.
good,"Great co-workers. People are fun and knowledgable, it feels like family. Love working with books. Seeing all the new books every day is one of the great perks."
good,"Good bookstore environment.  Looking to improve sales and competitive pricing. As far as the job, work life balance is up to your store manager. Pay and benefits for the FT and PT booksellers could improve."
good,The company is not making enough money to sustain employee hours which means shorter staff which means being backed up usually. Not something you would take on if you need to pay bills.More for people who live at home with 0 responsibilities
good,"I really enjoyed working at Barnes and Noble. However, as enjoyable as the job was, the pay was not enough for the work I had to do. My years of retail and general manager experience were only worth an extra 50 cents an hour to them and there were no advancement opportunities in my area."
good,I loved working in my field and with my co-workers. I loved working on storytimes and creating activities. I got the biggest thrill when I could find the right book for the right little customer. I was the Children's Lead. But I was also a lot of the time required to be in other parts of the store such as the cafe' or the music department or at guest services and that led to customer's in the Children's Department were not being helped or tasks were not being completed and not being able to man two stations at once was not an acceptable reason. Management in my store in particular was not very organized and would pull me out of my are of responsibility to back up other parts of the store but wouldn't give me the same help when I needed it. Overall my experience was very good and I loved helping customers and the people I worked with. I just didn't like the disorganization on the management level.
good,"The job was not fast paced or hectic really except holidays, which was nice. However selling memberships is much easier during the holiday season, but management and corporate expect you to sell at the same rate all year, which no one could do. So it was very stressful trying to live up to something that would not happen. That was definitely the hardest part, being pushy and trying to sell memberships. However, stocking shifts were better, as you can work more at your own pace and not be bothered much by customers or other employees. Also, the customer service desk was basically just helping people find books, which is interesting and gives you a chance to recommend books and discuss literature with customers and connect."
good,"Barnes and Noble is a great place to work if you need flexibility.  You can put in dates you are available to work 3 weeks in advanced and they will select from that, but you are expected to work at least 2-3 days each week.  The only problems I have had working at Barnes and Noble are being very bored during my shift and the time going by very slowly, and the management.  At our store we have 5 managers and 3 of them are wonderful, but the other 2 make me hate working there.  Booksellers are suppose to sell memberships and be at 2% and if you aren't at 2% they treat you bad, and are on your case because they assume you just aren't trying."
good,"The hours were hard, the pay was low, but the managers were, for the most part, caring about their employees. While I worked there, there was a quick turn over of store managers: I worked for 4 different ones."
good,My day at work begins with reading any notes about events in the café. Then I help a customer if needed and try to find what  they want to eat or drink.
good,"working here as a barista was fun. however you mostly worked by yourself so if you get slammed with soooo many people to serve you're doom! I and all the other baristas were cross trained so we could help anywhere but mostly everyone else was not. not only that but if you got things to take care of its hard getting decent hours. i would recommend this job for someone between the ages of 17-22."
good,"A typical day will run smoothly since the operations team there is excellent unless the General Merchandise dept decides their work is the chief concern and leave a work load of their duties to other depts and cashiers. The pay, minimum wage and you get bumped .25 cents a year, enough said there. other then that if you love books or tcu clothing great discount."
good,"The job itself was easy, way too easy at times. I worked at the bookstore at USC-Columbia, which unfortunately had over 13 managers running it (between merchandise, shipments, and textbooks). Because of this, and because they moved students in and out so quickly, most of the managers seemed really standoffish and didn't bother to get to know you at all. The temporary position lasted 3 months, and at the end of 2 months some of the managers still had to ask my name when doing attendance. Once the busy season died down, managers fired an overwhelming majority of temporary employees simply because they didn't want to pay them anymore. Otherwise, scheduling was fine but varied greatly--there were weeks I would work close to 30 hours, and weeks when I randomly wasn't scheduled to work at all. Worst part was they have little to no intention of keeping temporary employees (everybody starts as temps), which meant it was impossible to get a raise so the pay would always be $7.25."
good,The most enjoyable part of my job are the employees that I work with. Its not easy to work for this company.Management doesn't communicate well. Condescending environment.
good,I enjoyed Barnes and Nobles Cafe that is where I honed my barista skills.  The menu was the same as Starbucks so I learned all their drinks.  The down side was the hours I had to mention to the cafe manager that I had worked 6 to 8 weekends in a row!  But I also made good friends at Barnes and Nobles.
good,Coach and train employees on selling our membership program. Give hourly updates on sales and what we need to improve on.
good,"Typically a day at B&N was just working with customers and finishing whatever daily tasks were assigned to your area. I honed my customer service skills there and how to package and ship returns in the bookstore. Management was probably the least savory thing about the job there. Ultimately being the reason for leaving too. The most difficult part of the job was trying to shelve books in the early morning fast enough to their liking. I was always pretty meticulous about my organization so I was slower then most. The most enjoyable part of the job was most definitely the people. Getting to meet and greet so many different kinds of customers and just help them out with whatever they needed or were looking for. Whether it was in person, or just customers that needed help over the phones, I was always happy to lend a helping hand and an understanding ear to all. In the end that was definitely the most enjoyable part of the job. Working the music section regularly gave me the opportunity to expand my horizons on what genres and bands to listen to as well, since many customers would inform me of and recommend so many to myself over the years. Definitely the people coming into the store made it the most enjoyable."
good,"This job was great for while I was in college. The hours were flexible, however, the pay was not so great. During holidays and summer breaks, we were limited to 29 or less hours."
good,Management has changed significantly.  Pay is low.  Not much room for advancement.  Good benefits.  Nice staff.  erratic schedule  seems managers micro manage everything
good,"Overall it is company with good product and well managed at upper levels, yet not so much at store level. This must be understood a store is some what like an individual each one is different and follows the personality of the people who work in the store itself."
good,"you have to be a quick learner to succeed, proficient with computer, quick sales"
good,"It was an alright job, mainly just stocking merchandise as well as books. There wasnt anything really hard about the job at all."
good,"I enjoy the interaction I have with the customers on a daily basis, and the busy season is fun to work through because of the fast-paced environment. However, the hours are unsteady and slim. There are some opportunities to advance yourself but only if you have a decent manager."
good,All of the employees were able to get along and work well as a team. Corporate policies seemed to hinder the company rather than help it grow and expand. Too big of a focus on selling it's useless member cards.
good,"A lot of the management was very nice and supportive, but there were a few who could get very unprofessional very quickly.  There was an expectation to drop everything else in your life to work there as much as possible, even though they paid close or equal to minimum wage.  There is a constant turnover, leaving few employees who generally know what they are doing.  However, the coworkers were nice, and the discount was amazing."
good,"Clock in do busy work help customers and stand around finding books to either put away or read, clothes too. Mostly you cover call outs and the managers do the real jobs. "
good,"Assist with media setup in response to campus requests, trained new employees on technology use I also worked independently to set and meet deadlines and handle multiple media projects."
good,"My tenure with Barnes and Noble was very beneficial for my growth as a young worker in a customer service focused environment.  A typical day always included an interaction with a customer, and their satisfaction as a top priority.  Other responsibilities included merchandising, team building exercises, and designating tasks.  I learned a great deal about the intricacies of each.  The most enjoyable part of the job was managing a small team and keeping them happy in the work place, this was also the hardest part of the job, and I felt especially rewarded when I saw a team working together in harmony and enjoying themselves."
good,"I enjoyed working with books and movies. Helping the many varieties of people was also enjoyable. "
good,"A typical day of work consisted of helping students search and locate textbooks for class. Also shipping and receiving duties of the store for students, and sometimes having cashier shifts. Learning how to use the bookstore database to search things, and also learning how to use ups world ship was also very useful. management and co-workers some were pleasant others weren't. The hardest part excepting the rate of pay and the little opportunity for advancement with that particular branch."
good,"I have learned a lot at B&N about management largely due to a couple of good managers that I have had. The company in general is a good company but they do not value higher education in determining compensation or even as a valued skill. They expect their managers to live, eat and breath B&N, workin 70+ hours a week."
good,"Pros: Coworkers and management are great; very easy to get along with.  I met many interesting people here and loved being able to talk about books all day.  The schedule is flexible and the environment is pretty laid back.  Great discounts on books and food.  Low stress."
good,"A typical day at work would be making sure customers get excellent service and to keep them happy. Ive learned how to communicate better and how to work in a high-volume environment. The management isn't too good. My co-workers help out a lot, were a team. I don't think there is a hard part of the job, its simple in my opinion. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know the regular customers and meeting different people everyday."
good,"Working here has been good The company has very strong values, and follows competence in roles very closely.  This degree of detail is what helps the stores operate very well."
good,"This can be a fun place to work.  You have tasks to do every day  like stocking and customer service and occasionally helping a manager set something up.  But there are certain members of the management team that you can't count on to be friendly or supportive on a day to day basis.  When it comes to moving up in the company, the assistant manager has been in their position for years and doesn't seem to be going anywhere.  Merchandise manager seems like an ok position because you get to set up the displays and maintain the store, but from what I can see they are constantly being dumped on by the assistant and store managers.  The store manager can make people feel uncomfortable by grilling booksellers on which MOD they like working with and it feels like she is pitting people against each other.  Other than all of that, depending on which manager you work with for your shift, you can get all your tasks done and even have fun doing it."
good,"This store is in a great location, close to shops and food in the Maverick Avenue inside the CSU of Mankato State University. They are flexible with your class schedule and they are willing to let you leave early if you have homework or tests for classes that day. "
good,"I met some of my favorite people working here.  However, the first manager I worked under was nightmarish, and while the next manager was a much better person, I almost didn't receive my last paycheck due to his confusion about my schedule."
good,"Was a great company to work for in it's day but as the market has declined so has the quality of its operations, management and ability to deliver on its values and ability to commit to its employees"
good,Overall the experience was ok and I made some great friends. The pay was good too. The only thing I found unfortunate was how the management acted. One of the managers would always throw you under the bus to make themselves look good and the store manager made work unfavorable. She'd talk to you like you were a child and act passive aggressive when you'd talk to other employees. You'd have to come to work and work. It felt like elementary school. Sorry but I'm a people person and I want to love my job not be treated like I'm one of your children.
good,"Overall, a decent company to work for. The employees and most of the customers tend to be very friendly. Management is usually pretty helpful, but often times they become so sales driven they don't seem to care about the well-being of their employees. The hardest part of the job is dealing with irate customers who would rather shop online. The easiest part of the job is being around what i love, books; it makes helping the irate customers that much easier."
good,I was responsible for many different duties however I was completely isolated in a small area for 8 hrs a day. This was NOT fun & made for extremely long days. My co-workers were wonderful although I saw them for 30 minutes a day before one of us had to leave. I learned to ship/receive/order merchandise as well as installing electronic equipment & performing job interviews. The hardest part was being alone all day doing the same boring things day in day out. The most enjoyable aspect was selecting unknown music & playing it over the store to promote sales. As for the management- it was a sink or swim mentality as at times was jaw dropping as I was threatened with losing my job for having two shoplifters arrested *they had warrants out*. I had no real support from management & was never thanked for anything I ever did.
good,Make sure you are a full time bookstore team member otherwise they won't care about you.
good,"There are a lot of fun and exciting things going on at Barnes & Noble. It is an easy job and can be fun. However, it can be equally stressful. The customer base is trying and the management (both store level and corporate) do not value their employees. The good does not out-weigh the bad."
good,"It was a very demanding job yet enjoyable. I was in charge of scheduling over 50 people per week, overseeing the operations of the store, and resolving customer (external and internal) complaints."
good,Interesting mix of the best and the worst when it came to co-workers; still many growing pains to be ironed out.
good,"I had a lot of fun working there because I love books and customer service, but it gets so stressful at times. There are just too many books and customers except you to know everything about everything. Especially during the busy times, management does not staff more people, so customers get upset for the 20 people waiting at the customer service desk // the 10 people on hold on the phone to get help. I learned a lot about what was hot in reading during the time. The co-workers were great, but I get along with a lot of people. You get 1/2 off the cafe and 30% off books. Management was wishy-washy. For a job that does not pay that much, it is what is expected. I didn't get let go, but I got pushed to one day a week because of the ""off season."" Not worth the money, but worth the experience."
good,"It's a smaller store which is nice. There are always tasks to be completed and the co-workers are very nice. Customer Service is a huge part of the job. Whether they are in the store or on the phone. A typical day requires, answering phones, receiving inventory, helping customers in the store, filling online orders and keeping the store looking great."
good,"While at Barnes and Noble, the schedules were very flexible and the workers were all very easy to get along with. Barnes and Noble were very welcoming and allowed every day to be carried along as smoothly as possible for the workers and the customers."
good,Barnes & Noble is one of several dream jobs of mine and I can happily say I’ve accomplished it. I got very lucky with my department. They welcomed me in from day one and we all treat each other like family.
good,"I loved what it taught me about books and how it also gave me the selling aspect with B&N Memberships. However, Barnes and Noble can be very slow at times and may be very boring for some."
good,"Working here was amazing and a lot of fun, management wasn't good at all but I think their is new management. not very flexible with hours. great pay and holiday pay"
good,I've been with the company for five years and the day today can change depending on the customer traffic but the main focus is to keep the store organized and keeping displays full. I have learned a lot especially being in management. The biggest thing that i have learned is patience and empathy. The work environment can be tough because we're short staffed and have been for a few years now. The hardest part of work is dealing with upset customers on busy days. What I enjoy the most about the job is being able to make people happy by helping find what they are looking for. .
good,"Pros:"
good,"Corporate retail is going to be the same pretty much everywhere, but if you have a passion for reading, you can at least enjoy that.  Be prepared to be frustrated with corporate interference and shift cuts."
good,Minimum pay but always got hours and the people are really nice  management has been flexible and understanding about schedule. Everything is good besides pay
good,To live in Florida the payment definitely was not enough but the management was very chill and understanding and scheduling wise was fairly flexible do not think anyone ever got fired.
good,"Working here was a pleasure as it allowed me to obtain customer service skills, organizational skills, and research skills. Management was a pleasure and while opportunity for growth could have been better, it was a pleasure to work for them."
good,"Working at Barnes and Noble was fun, until the management started falling apart due to the declining business. B&N doesnt seem to really care about employees but they cant afford to during this terrible time for the retail market so I get it. Who doesnt love being surrounded by books all day so that always made it worth it but definitely not a place to make a career."
good,"Working at Barnes and Noble is just about exactly how you can imagine it, casual. The work experience there was something that anybody can do, but it might not be meant for anyone. If you enjoy helping people out daily and have no problems standing for long periods of time, then by all means apply."
good,A typical day at work includes opening toys and games and receiving book orders. You may also have to shelve the books and games in the correct places and while shelving assist customers In finding books.
good,This company offers room to grow for employees. I definitely recommend this job as a temporary job as opposed to a permanent position. Training is decent and management works with you to grow.
good,Fun place to work. very laid back but a great environment. Wasn't easy to advance in the company  so it is a great job for someone who has never had a job before.
good,"I was first introduced to the job through a friend who said they were asking for help. I simply enjoyed the people and slower pace of the job, but ultimately it was only ever a way to earn some extra money while I was on campus and I never had plans to advance. That being said, I was committed to doing my best at the job until I left, and shortly after I graduated and left the store made some major changes in staffing."
good,"I worked part-time as a bookseller before I was promoted to SIM, and I loved it. As a manager, there was a lot more responsibility, of course, but there was a lack of training and teaching in regards to those responsibilities. We were very short staffed, so I had to be as many different positions as I could, all while being the key-carrying manager on duty in charge of driving sales and coaching booksellers. Being short staffed meant a lot of work but little time to do it because overtime and and payroll was monitored quite heavily for full-time employees. Part-time employees were overworked, 32+ hours most weeks. The benefits aren't terrible, but there could definitely be more stability and compensation."
good,I enjoyed working here but my manager was not very flexible with my schedule that I warned him in my interview would be constantly changing. The training is minimal and often employees teach other - there is a lack of formality here.
good,"The managers were cool and it was fun but they only hire part time so they don't have to give anyone benefits, and the hourly wage sucked with no tips. The break policies are also ridiculous because they make you clock out then stand in line instead of just quickly making and buying your food before you go. It's a sinking company and unless you don't need money, I wouldn't recommend it."
good,Packing items for customers orders and specials orders that would have to go out on time. The job is temp to hire. I would recommend to lots of people
good,"Management was kind and willing to train you well, especially if you come on during the pre-Holiday hiring, but their talk of future potential was all lip service. The Manager I worked for retired 2 years ago so I can't speak to how the Broadway branch is being managed these days."
good,The day to day is very simple average retail. However the current manager at Barnes and Noble Fullerton is awful. They micromanage and are always telling you what you are doing wrong which is most of the time nothing. They do not make you feel appreciated and work you to the bone. They act as if this is your career even though it is a part time position.
good,"They give a lot of breaks and the managers are nice and care about you. Unfortunately, pay is very low and there’s pretty much no opportunity to receive a raise or advance in any way."
good,"I love the people I work with, and I love management. They work with my schedule and are understanding. "
good,The people working there were super nice and helpful to me just coming in. The holiday rush was pretty stressful but I did enjoy the work. I really did like working there and I wish I wasn't a temp
good,"Book readers are, from my experience, the nicest people I have serviced. The team members rival these customers in their pleasant attitude. I wish I could have continued working with the company. However, it just did not provide a livable wage."
good,I didn't worj for marnes and noble I worked for a call center and I do not remember their name. It was not a good experience they would take money from your pay
good,"Ultimately, this was just a job that paid for expenses during school - but it wasn't anywhere near as bad as most retail I've worked in my life. Managers were extremely understanding with regards to my school schedule, the pay was above state minimum wage, and I found fulfillment insofar as I love books and talking to anyone I can about them."
good,Had a couple of managers who behaved in an unprofessional manner towards employees. They would approach me either very condescendingly and with a sense of superiority.
good,"Not ideal for early on in your career, probably a better place to work if it's your 3rd job. Decent, not great hours, not a particularly demanding job unless it's during a product sales season."
good,"It was a decent place to work. 12 hr shifts, 3-4 days off. But after 15 plus years being called in to find out your entire department got outsourced stunk. This was 3 years ago. The reason for this review isnt to hammer them but to tell people to Google Barnes and Noble layoffs for the year 2018 and 2019. Major layoffs.  As for the poor CEO rating, they have had 4 different CEOs in 3 years. All researchable information. They are dying"
good,"cafe lead was a very fun job and I met some amazing people working there. unfortunately the SM there likes to micromanage cafe for some reason and it quickly turned into a place I could not stand to be at. the job itself is very fun and you keep busy, the customer base is awful, the coworkers you meet there are the best. but, this was just my personal experience there."
good,"Worked as a barista in back of a bookstore. Nobody buys books anymore full price so most of the business fell to me. Managers were all bookseller managers who didn't know what my job was like and were no help,"
good,"Fairly good place to work with relatively good job advancements. There are good management, and other employees are nice. I would reccoment this place to others"
good,"This was a really fun place to work when I started back in 2007. Over the years though, declining sales meant either long shifts with little backup, or few hours."
good,The working environment is only fast paced during the beginning and end of the school semester. It is very relaxed. Kind of boring working as the cashier.
good,"Boring job, with poor pay and rude customers. The only plus to the whole job was the employee discount on books and in the café. Management was lazy and uninspiring"
good,just a customer service job. No complaints really. It was fine. There was a lot of up selling required. Pleasant atmosphere. We got breaks. It was quiet
good,"I was a lifelong employee, because I love books. The last few years were more and more stressful. I think s part time position wpumd still be fun, but the company has changed."
good,The company has experienced many ups and downs had has restructured in the last few months.  The pay is disgraceful and you do work hard to achieve.  The manager does recognize when you work hard
good,It really depends on the particular store and the management team. My management team never had the same ideas of how to run the store and their employees. It made the days tiring and stressful.
good,"Working at Barnes & Noble is working in a slower paced environment and there's not much stress that comes with the job. There is the occasional difficult customer, but nothing that can't be handled in a quick and effective manner."
good,It was very laid back and fun! The recipes were easy to memorize and construct and the customers were very friendly! They were flexible with my schedule outside of that particular place of employment and tend to be mindful of if you have a second job or if you still attend school. I looked forward to my shift.
good,If you want a general manager to be up your butt for tasks that are outside of your pay-grade then work here by all means! All other managers are absolutely wonderful and competent people as are most all of the associates. GM just pushes for way too much without enough compensation. Good for part time high schoolers.
good,B&N was a pleasant place to work but they offered no full time positions and the 20 hours of part-time employment came with no benefits and they wouldn't budge from five four hour shifts and since it was 50 miles round trip the gasoline took a nice chunk out of the low pay
good,"I worked at barnes and nobles for a year and I have to say the workers are great, but days will go from no customers to a full on rush hour.  The one thing I did not like is the fact that I applied for a bookseller's position and ended up in the cafe instead, and what is even worse is that I ended working their the entire time in cafe and only got to work as a bookseller once."
good,"it is interesting to be able to work with the schools, businesses and non-profits on a daily basis.  Helping them to find books that they need for their students."
good,"The job was in a good location from where I went to school. The management was not ver knowing of what they were doing, and wasn't a very welcoming enviroment."
good,There felt like no connection between the employees. The management only seemed to interact with us when they needed something or we had done something wrong. Horrible scheduling and posting of said schedule.
good,They relied on too much competition for sales driving and up selling. At first it was fun but after a while it becomes tiresome. The discounts are nice but the overall working experience isn’t that great.
good,"The work environment was comfortable, just not enough work hours for my liking.The manager was very helpful if I had any questions, and I learned a lot from working there."
good,I really enjoyed the discounts with this job. It's a great job if you like working with people and love books/reading. The pay isn't great. Management was okay.
good,"My B&N has a very high turn over rate in terms of employee employment length. However, I think this not only has to do with amazon's overhaul of popular products making them more available at a more affordable price. Barnes and nobles also doesn't pay their workers enough to stick around especially knowing there is no room for career advancement as also mentioned in the hiring interview."
good,"management is biased, hours aren't distributed evenly the customers are great usually give or take. The people there aren't that pleasant but overall its an okay place to work"
good,"Unfortunately this position was downsized, but loved the job.   If company can stay competitive with outside forces and stays relevant it excellent atmosphere."
good,Scheduling is very flexible. You’re meeting new people everyday. After the main event there weren’t many hours given. Management was fair. Not many tasks on a slow day.
good,"I worked for a campus bookstore, so it got pretty hectic during the first few weeks of classes, but other than that, it was pretty chill. I mainly worked in the twxt book department."
good,"Overall, it's a good place to work. However, some people would call out a lot. The people who I worked with were nice but I couldn't adjust to the atmosphere of the place."
good,"I do not have much to say as I did not work for them long enough to have an opinion."
good,"Working at B&N was fun for the first year. As time went on, corporate took over more and more, and we had less and less freedom as employees. People started getting laid off, so we were short staffed all the time and therefore always stressed at work. The pay is less than what you’d make anywhere else in the mall. Things are constantly changing which makes employees have to be on high alert at all times in fear of messing something up and getting reprimanded."
good,Almost always super crowded so its hard to move around. Some supervisors have favorites. Improper health training. Almost impossible to switch positions.
good,"Barnes and noble was an enjoyable place to work, simple job that comes with the benefits of books and coffee. the employers of Barnes and noble (at least at the time I applied) are willing to hire those with little to no experience which is greatly appreciated."
good,A great job for young people who have this as their first job. The hours are flexible and being around well read people is a very nice environment to be in.
good,"Just a bookseller in all phases pertaining to the business."
good,This was a great place to work. Everyone that I encountered there was very professional. It's a shame I had to move or I'd still be working there to this day. Amazing benefits.
good,"Barnes & Noble is an equal opportunity employer. For a full time employee they provide good benefits. Among these benefits are health, dental and vision insurance and a 401K option. A store discount and paid time off are also included."
good,"I adore the people I work with in the store, and even the customers aren't bad compared to other retail experiences I have had, but the company doesn't care for it's employees. We are consistently expected to meet demands that we have not been allotted enough payroll for. Earlier this year they laid off many of our full-time employees so they wouldn't have to pay them benefits, which left us under-staffed and under-trained. I was expected to take on the responsibilities of my supervisor on top of my own, with no prior notice and no pay increase. Then an employee with the same position at another store got pregnant and asked for health insurance, but they didn't want to pay for that so they cut her hours AND mine (and every other receiver, I hear) and now I can't afford to pay my rent."
good,"I worked with some great people at this company, but as a bookseller with over a decade of experience it was painful to watch the company continue to make poor, cutthroat decisions more and more frequently.   Truly sad."
good,The coworkers made this job so much better. The management had a tendency to ask you for above and beyond without even giving raises or an incentive to go above and beyond. But it’s a good job to have while you go for something more permanent.
good,"BN is great for the sense of community if you find yourself in the right store. The employee discount is pretty awesome, and employee appreciation weeks push that even more. Being able to work with a select clientele rather than your ""normal"" retail heps as well. "
good,I worked here years ago when you could still find book stores. It appears to be a dying industry and there are dwindling opportunities for jobs or advancement.
good,"Barnes and Noble was not a terrible place to work, but the manager was not the best and I couldn't take that they cut everyone's hours. The dress code was very linnet so that was nice!"
good,I had the opportunity to work with some great people. Management and Staff were passionate and knowledgable about the business. Work is fast paced and rewarding.
good,"This job was actually a lot more work than advertised and personally i felt that the pay was too low for the amount of work you had to keep up with. Regardless, i did enjoy the job but the shifts were only four hours long when I worked there."
good,"I was a seasonal hire and then became a regular part time worker. Since i was seasonal i was trained on almost everything and was bounced around the store, while other workers were not expected to do that. Pay was awful as minimum wage in IA is still 7.25"
good,"I didn't really learn anything during my time at Barnes and Noble. This job wasn't as inclusive as my other one, and I only needed it because of money"
good,"Higher-ups in corporate started forcing booksellers to sell a certain book to ""every customer who comes in the door"" which totally destroys the personal relationships between customers and booksellers."
good,"Worked during day writing code. Mentoring junior and senior developers since I did the work as a project lead and architect."
good,"The Barnes and Noble Cafe is an ok place to work. The people and position can provide a fun work environment. However, this is the only Barista position I've had that doesn't allow tips. so you will probably earn minimum wage."
good,Stressful with managers who expect a lot with no a lot to do daily. Very strict with little things that made the whole atmosphere hard to work with...
good,"All my coworkers and managers are enjoyable to work with and when things are going well it's wonderful to work for this company, however, with the competition of Amazon, this company has begun to suffer and has begun to cut back all staff they can possibly cut back on, leaving booksellers to pick up the slack, running themselves ragged to get work done. There are never enough hours in a shift to get all tasks done."
good,"Hours go by very slow, you often stand doing nothing. It's never busy, even the busiest days are easy to handle. Customers tend to be more hostile here for some reason though."
good,Its not a bad job by any means well above the average retail job. But its not something your going to be able to live off of for the longest time. For the most part the coworkers and discounts are better than the job itself.
good,"This is a great place to work, laid back and everyone is friendly. Lots of independence and some awesome food options compared to the typical Starbucks. Also discounts on books!"
good,"As it is with any other specialty retailer, this job is best suited for those who have a passion for the merchandise. If you are an active reader, have an inquisitive nature, and otherwise love being around books and media, this is a great company. This is not a retail situation that works well with someone who is just earning a paycheck."
good,Great starter company to work at to gain experience. A good learning company to pick up great skills. Workplace is business friendly and comfortable. Everyone is easy to work with and get along with.
good,"Working at a bookstore means you will encounter some interesting characters; this includes your fellow employees and the customers, which makes the job a bit more interesting. Being cross-trained in all areas of the store makes one ten times more needed. All in all, working for Barnes and Noble makes me want to always work at a bookstore no matter where I'm living in the world."
good,Barnes and Noble has stayed in the past when it comes to running a business in the current economy. They promote who has been around the longest instead of who is most qualified. As a result there are many store managers and higher that have no business running a store.
good,"picking and pulling orders, forklift operation loading and unloading trucks,.fast paced no time to relax.all work. overtime available during seadon. putting inventory away with fork lift"
good,While  I love working for the company recent events make me feel insecure in my job. The company used to offer benefits for most of its employees but has greatly scaled back.  I need to find a full time position with benefits but would like to stay on part time.
good,"while working at Barnes and noble I had my first experience with office politics. My manager made work uncomfortable for anyone she didn't favor. I felt super uncomfortable a lot. Many days my cafe manager and store manager wouldn't do any work. They were very close and would literally spend HOURS in the back office watching YouTube videos, Netflix movies, texting or just talking. This behavior literally happened every week and there was absolutely no oversight what so ever. No one monitored them, and no one came forward to complain out of fear for losing their jobs. Barnes and noble the company I loved working for, I enjoyed my job and coworkers, but a serious look needs to be taken at the structure of management."
good,"I really can't go into many details regarding my time at B&N. As part of my severance agreement, I can not say anything that might be construed as disparaging."
good,"Worked in the Cafe, and was absolutely appreciated for my work there. I was always thanked, and it was pretty great."
good,"This company is going down because of short-sighted corporate management and a refusal to align their stated vision with their policies."
good,The individual stores have very different environments to work for. Most are their own little family which is nice. Unfortunately the company is on a down hill slide and eliminating all full time positions.
good,The job was easy but frustrating at times. There was not a lot of work space. Backroom could be crowded but management was kind and friendly. They worked with you and looked out for you.
good,Nice workplace culture. Able to have good customer interaction. Management very understanding of the work/home balance. Most enjoyable part of job was customer service.
good,"As the little time i worked there, i knew i didn't belong there. The manager made me feel uncomfortable, i wore a hijab then so i knew many were to fond about it."
good,"Worked there for months."
good,"It is fun working with books though it is a retail job so the biggest drawback is that it only takes that one customer to ruin even the best of days. Schedules vary from week to week though they do try to have them out 3 weeks in advance. Recently hours are getting cut and additional work is being piled on the people who are there, a trend that I only foresee continuing. You really get the impression that the people making all the decisions only care about the bottom line and don't give a second thought to their hourly peons."
good,"Management positions are challenging, with the expectation that you juggle quite a few responsibilities while being coverage on the bookfloor. Metrics must be met. The people are amazing, though."
good,"As a sales representative at B&N, my main objective was to up-sell company membership and credit cards. Within the first two months, I was commended and awarded as the #1 district salesman (the best sales employee across two U.S. states and 15 stores), and held the title through 3 consecutive months. Aside from promoting memberships and credit cards, I served as a head cashier and also helped with product organization, re-stocking, and the upkeep/cleaning of my department."
good,Hardest part was balancing helping customers and doing projects. Some days we just didn't have enough staff to get everything done and sufficient assist customers.
good,"Typical retail. Books are ancient technology but the way they are being sold is changing. Most people will like working there, but don't expect to read on the job."
good,cutting hours and making a bookseller do the same amount of work in less time is unrealistic and unfair when the managers don't try to pick up the slack. i wouldn't recommend this company to anyone since its failing as a whole anyway.
good,"Typical day: receiving the day's shipment, sorting the contents, assisting co-workers, returning books to publishers, attending to various other duties. What I learned: a strong work ethic. Management: over the years it has ranged from fair to outstanding. Workplace culture: depends on the staff at any given time--if you have positive, committed employees the culture is good; when you don't the culture is bad. The hardest part of the job: dealing with a large number of people, all with different personalities and temperaments. The most enjoyable part of the job: being recognized for a job well done."
good,"Barnes and Noble is a nice start off job for high school students. Very open to train other, and it's expected to be a team player. Its important to keep the customers satisfied at all times, for after all thats why we are there."
good,"The best part of the job is working with my store manager. She is a great person to work with. She's very positive. However, I don' t like working in retail. I struggled with being on my own from the minute I was hired. No one really knew how to help me train for my job because my department was the lowest priority. It was really hard to get part time help in my department during the busiest times, so a lot of the times I had to manage a job of three people."
good,Working for big companies is always stressful as they're very uptight about their image. If you just keep your head down you'll do well but I didn't like the feeling of being on thin ice all the time. Also my working schedule was different every week which was hard on a student.
good,Not a bad place to work. The energy is really good and if you like books it can be really ideal. I also thought that the hours were fair and managers weren't bad.
good,I enjoyed the relaxing atmosphere and the chance to meet many nice and interesting people who were of many different cultures. My co-workers and I got along very well.
good,Working at B&N was very stressful. Its a retail place so customers are generally rude and stressful. They spread you too thin and you are asked to work certain areas before you are trained.
good,"Working at this place isn't that bad, management is okay, although I think the customers really make or break the job. Considering it's a small cafe and many customers believe it to be a Starbucks instead and them hassling the staff makes it a stressful job. If you're great at handling trouble maker customers and you enjoy it--this job is for you. Also caution pretentious customers who come in everyday expect you to know their order as they're a regular."
good,"It is ok. The day is grueling. The use of the break system is ok and the use of the days off policy is sometimes difficult to operate, particularly during holidays. The opportunity for growth is dependent upon the region of the country you are living in."
good,"Fun place to work for a college kid just working to get through school. Nice discounts on books, food and drink. A unique working experience and environment."
good,"you get to meet a lot of new people in this store but it is repettitive work and gets boring.  The cafe is hard labor as well.  If you're young and looking for a first time career, then it's a great place to work."
good,They work around your schedule for school. Management was not always cohesive. High turnover. Friendly atmosphere. Easy job. Laid back. Could get boring at times.
good,As a rule those who read are more knowledgeable. Took part in many fun and broad ranged conversations while working in a bookstore. The nature of the business has moved into the technological age.
good,"very good work environment"
good,"If you like reading, there will always be a good part to your job. While the company is quickly becoming more retail focused than laid back, the backbone continues to be selling books. During any day, you'll find yourself having to recommend multiple titles, shelving books in their correct section in the correct way, and selling the membership. On a lesser note, you'll be moving anywhere between 1-40lbs at a time, building fixtures, and attending overnights to revamp the store. Even with selling the membership, it's not a competitive workplace, and it's generally enjoyable."
good,learned a lot about lease accounting when I worked there.  The people that worked there were very nice.  Everyone helped each other out as much as possible.
good,"Very fast paced, and ready to make orders in a timely manner. Learned people really love their coffee. Management could have been more interactive. Workplace was very driven. Hardest part was always wanting to help one more. I enjoyed keeping a well kept area at all times."
good,"Very fast-paced environment, friendly co-workers and flexible with shift changes/schedule adjustments. Discounts are great, good training setup from existing managers and staff."
good,I enjoyed working at BN.  It was a booklovers dream job.  We had access to pre-published books and could help find the perfect book for each customer.
good,Good place to work if you enjoy books and helping others. Not a lot of room to advance and pay is not very competitive. Stressful if you don't meet goals
good,I enjoyed my time working for the bookstore. The customers were nice. The employees were nice. The employee discount was nice. The commute was short for me.
good,"Typical retail environment with emphasis on hand-selling, up-selling, and driving sales in general. Supportive and friendly coworkers, but slow advancement opportunities."
good,Discount was the best part of the job as well as building a connection with customers over mutual love for literature. Management was pretty good across the board.
good,"Fun, enjoyable and well structured.you learned customer services skills. Management was fair.The culture was diverse. The hardest part of this job was the re-organizing the book inventory since it got really messy at the start of the semester.The best part of this job was you get to interact with a lot of people and help them."
good,"What I loved most about the job was that no two days looked alike, and that I got to dialogue with all kinds of people about my passion: books. Every shift had a different assignment and slightly different schedule, so all week I would be performing a variety of tasks from shelving to store displays to customer service."
good,"Good company to work for if you are starting out in the food industry or customer service. Workplace was a pace that anyone can handle, and team members were very helpful to work with."
good,"Lots of responsibilities in author management and events, special promotional events and partnered events like those conducted with Disney. Workplace culture is challenging with some personalities."
good,Changing managers and directors at the corporate level make for stressful workplace. At this point they don't know who they want to be.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
good,"low pay, low respect, very monotanous, but its good for college kids that need a flexible schedule.   I really would never recommend a retail enviroment to anyone its a form of modern slavery.  Youre never gonna have enough money to start a family or even enjoy your life... I really cant think of anything this job did to improve my life, or skill set"
good,"It's okay. It's very labor oriented, it's hard to figure out what's next, some days get a little slow but there's still a sort of fun vibe to it depending on how things go day by day."
good,"•	Aided customers in finding desired products and placed orders for items not found in-store"
good,I only worked here part time during holiday season. Hours were minimal. Co-workers were fun and friendly. Typical retail employment experience. Not much else!
good,"Many B&N College locations feature mainly daytime hours with limited late nights and weekends, which is unusual in retail.  Being such a large company means health benefits are fairly inexpensive, and there is a generous 401k match."
good,I work directly with our customers assisting them in finding the items they are looking for and recommending additional items. My sales per customer consistently rank higher than any of my co-workers.
good,"filled book orders for students for upcoming semester, customer service, ring up orders on cash register, ordering supplies, inventory of stock, restocked shelves, helped students with purchases"
good,"I handled books from the freight arrival to the cash register. Being able to talk to someone and give them a recommendation and having them come back for more feels fantastic! I've learned a lot about hiring, training, and promoting. I enjoy watching someone I hired go up the ladder."
good,"I worked as a part-time barista at the Barnes N Noble Cafe, and crossed trained for the book store itself. I recommend this job for college and high school students because it is mellow, short shifts, and a great atmosphere. However, there is about a 5% chance of career advancement and pay increase. Compensation is barely minimum wage, and they give wage increases yearly that are about 25-75 cents. The staff is respectful and family-oriented towards one another. Customers are usually chill, but it gets stressful around holidays, and expect to work them."
good,The environment was generally very pleasant.  New management made the environment less cheerful.  I had been there a year without complaining until new management came along and was way over his head.
good,"Working for Barnes & Noble was ultimately rewarding experience solely due to the job culture and employees I worked with. There is very little chance of job security and basically no chance of advancement. The compensation was, while slightly better than most local retail wages, not enough to make up for the days that I was called 15 minutes before my shift and told not to come in nor the days where I was called 30 minutes before a shift that I wasn't scheduled for, to be told I must arrive for the shift."
good,"Working as a Barnes and Noble ""College"" temporary bookseller was simple. You sell books for full time hours as a part time employee and get paid minimum wage and usually are on your own."
good,"Pay was low, the benefits are good though. Constant churn of executives led to sometimes contradicting messages coming down to store level. Working there was not bad."
good,"it was a great place to work but the hours were few and far between, the management had a couple problems but were resolved quickly after they came to fruition"
good,I wasn't there that long. Management was nice from what I remember. Coworkers were just kind of desperate for cash college kids. Consistently busy because it was textbook buying season.
good,"great place for a first job. there is a very distinct way of doing things and while the job itself isn't hard, it is however very stressful if you do not enjoy large crowds."
good,This job was a great opportunity as a college student trying to make extra cash. It allowed me the chance to work throughout the year and not really have much interruption of work where that would be the case with a work study job.
good,"The associates, managers and district managers create a strong network for an outstanding organization. They deliver the best customer service of any book industry out there."
good,what you would expect from retail. the work can be difficult and unrewarding but it is also a low stress environment. Barnes and noble does not offer great benefits
good,"This was my first job many moons ago. I loved all of my coworkers and have since learned that you don't make lasting friendships like I did here at other places. The cafe is fast paced many times in a day and being quick and efficient is essential to a smooth running day. The pay is a little above min wage, which is expected. If I were to ever move back to that town and needed a retail job I would go back."
good,"Learned the basics of retail book selling. Placed orders for textbooks and supplies with regional distributors. Processed online orders for customers. Answered customer’s questions about store policies and products, as well as the status of their orders. Handled Cash. Trained new employees to use the book-buy-back computer system."
good,"A typical day at work is pretty fast paced and you will learn a lot of general workplace skills like communication, sales, cashiering, handling product.  Co-workers are amazing.  Hardest part is working long shifts or being asked to fill in for people who do not show up to work, which happens more than it should."
good,"A typical day at B&N involves examining product displays and filling them in to make them attractive.  Dusting, cleaning spills up, organizing the books -- all pretty easy and straightforward.  Inventory is a little more work, but keeps you moving and the days can fly by!"
good,"Before I begin, a caveat - my B&N experience was almost 10 years ago, so I know things have changed.  The best parts of the job were working in a bookstore (love to read), the low-pressure sales (no earbuds with manager barking how far the store is from its sales goal, like in other retail), the 50% cafe discount, and the insurance (if you can get it - i hear part-timers can no longer get insurance.  When I was there, part-timers were eligible after a year).  "
good,Organizing scattered books back to there original sections. Assisting customers on the availability of books and recommending other books based on their liking.
good,I liked working here because I enjoy being in a bookstore. I did not care for the management. There wasn't much opportunity to advance either and I had to work with a bunch of snooty hipster types. I liked the retirees who worked there part time. I hated having to shill for their stupid membership though. It's a ripoff unless you are in the bookstore spending money every day. i always felt bad talking someone into buying something I wouldn't buy myself.
good,"The company overall is a good company to work for. they do not pay their employees ( servers, and booksellers) well in my eyes and they asks a lot of them for little pay."
good,This store was not the correct match for me. I prefer to not comment on this company. It maybe a good fit for someone else. It was not for me.
good,Barnes and Noble is a great place to work. I love being around books and people. My typical day involves providing customer service and add on sales as well as membership sales. I also stock and maintain displays near the register. I get along with who I work with. I do find it hard to sale memberships at times.
good,"My first impression of the Barnes and Noble Cafe is that it is very organized and most people are willing to help others to reach a common goal; giving the costumers fun and friendly service. Throughout my time here, I have learned how to balance 40 hours of work a week with 14 hours of classes and still have time to study and hang out with friends. Not only are my co-workers supportive of me, they have become really good friends of mine in such a short amount of time. The hardest part of the job is definitely working with people who don't have the same objective as I, or the rest of the team, does. When in this situation, it is difficult to handle all of the chaos that usually comes with the job along with people not wanting or willing to do their job. On a different note, the best part of the job I currently hold is talking to my fellow co-workers and getting to know them better. In just a little over a month, I have made a friend who jumps up and down with joy when we're put on hot bar together, a group of people who I go to Breakaway with every Tuesday and another friend who motivates me in all the craziness life brings to a freshman college student."
good,"The location i worked at was in the mall, were it is always busy. people would always come in and out of the store wither to get to the mall or to the parking lot, people will always end up shopping in Barnes and noble always keeping us busy. I enjoy learning about new books and talking with customers about a book they are interested in. I was a very fun environment."
good,"The barnes and noble of today ,is much different yhen the barnes and noble of yesterday . Much less secure of a job place and a more of a try anything to see if it sticks desperate measure of a company now a manager there's fear that you could be next to go for any reason AT ALL due to stores being closed and dms wanting to keep and move other managers ."
good,"If you are a booklover this is the place to work. I started there part-time because I spent most of my free time there. My favorite place to work was in receiving.  I saw all new merchandise as it came in."
good,The best thing about the job is the people and the books. Love meeting and working with new and established authors. Helping people discover new books!
good,Loved my coworkers but mangers could be a bit difficult. Only one manager understood what us as booksellers went through in the store with customers. Was a great place to learn about multitasking.
good,Good workplace friendly enviroment good salary an everyday view of working at barnes and nobles consists of arranging books reselfing greeting and being responsible for customers
good,I learned many different skills while working here. The scheduling was flexible with my class schedule when I was a student. During the first  couple of weeks and the last week of classes is the busiest time of the quarter. Co-workers were just like family.
good,"The job entails fast paced drink making, food preparation and customer service. Difficult customers, here and there, but the work is simple once one learns it. However the management often messes up schedules, doesn't listen to availability, and is seldom understanding or helpful in terms of time off, sick time, and even transferring locations. Much personal bias in the annual reviews, as well. "
good,"Wasn't always too busy, or too slow. The perfect amount of customers. I learned food handling and drink making skills along with customer service skills. The management was strict, but efficient. My co-workers were great and made the day go by faster. The hardest part of the job was difficult customers. The most enjoyable part was making friends with co-workers and the regulars."
good,Fast paced worked environment that allowed me to learn more about the products we sell and working alongside coworkers that were about the same mission of customer satisfaction.
good,"Working at BN is great if you enjoy different types of media and talking about them.  With an open mind you can have a fun time working there.  Some of the managers are awesome; supportive teachers who won't hold your hand but they will teach you repeatedly if you ask.  When the s*** rolls downhill, it gathers more as it rolls.  Dayforce is allowed to schedule people whenever and where ever you are available, so craft your availability carefully and vigilantly.  The customers are above average at BN; some characters, but mostly quality folks.  If you find you love retail, BN is the place for you."
good,"Working for Barnes and Noble has been an interesting experience.  I've gotten to work with and meet lots of interesting people.  Seeing different authors come in for signings has been neat, doing events for Denver Comic Con and Get Pop cultured at the store has been fun.  I've been there seven years and have seen many changes happen within the store and around the neighborhood it is located in, some not always for the better.   I've liked my co-workers and at times it has been a good place to work but unfortunately things have changed in the managers and type of people who come in.   Customers seem to have ""better than thou"" attitudes, managers don't support or back up employees, they cater to people who just come in and loiter and trash the store.  Way past time to leave the job."
good,"Management is quick to over-hire and bring in ""permanent/ full time"" help during the busy season, only to drop these employees' hours to nearly nothing (6 hours/week) in an attempt to force resignation during slow periods."
good,"The barnes and noble cafe was fun to work in, due to the fact that it kept me on my toes constantly. The management there for the whole store were not the friendliest, but the cafe manager was the nicest person I have ever met in a managerial position."
good,"Sees great value in each member of staff. Systems are out dated and company needs a face lift. But a good place to work "
good,"I would either be working at customer service, music, or at the register. I would answer phone calls to help people look for books, dvds, or cds. Throughout the day I would put away books in there correct location and make sure that they are in alphabetical order. The hardest part of my job was selling memberships to customers. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with coworkers."
good,"This is not a job if have a lot of responsibilities such as rent or car insurances. Its ok for high school or college students. Your interacting with people everyday creating drinks and food. Its a multitasking so you have to be fast and have good memory. You are normally trained by the manager, assistant manager, or the cafe lead. It will take at least a month for you to know all the drinks."
good,Great opportunity to gain work experience as a bookseller. I think that the corporate culture at Barens & Noble is very encouraging and good overall.
good,"I enjoyed my time working here because it was a fun environment with some cool coworkers and customers. There wasn't a lot of upward mobility though, and the hours and pay were a little light."
good,THe most enjoyable part of this job includes being surrounded by all the books and music/movies!! I love our store because I helped open the store from the beginning!
good,"I love the customer service aspect of my B&N job. My co-workers make the job fun. I also enjoy learning about market trends, books, and sales."
good,"the pay is horrible, the management put everything on me, it was a extremely stressful job. The co workers were okay but I wouldn't recommend this job to anybody. I been at this job for 10+ years and I only received one promotion. This job is literally just a step stone job until I find something better."
good,It was just something to pick up a few hours a week. We organized books that students ordered at the university and had it ready for them when they came to pick up their order.
good,"My days are filled with multiple tasks from customer service, cashiering, and shelving. This job allows me the chance to extend my love of reading and to hopefully pass this along to others. At times, the days are too full but there are always new things to learn."
good,"learned a lot of starbucks drinks "
good,BN was a fun place to work. The people were interesting. The pay wasn't great and when you hit your ceiling on the matrix you get a minimal raise every other year.
good,"Barnes and nobles has an endless amount of work to do, its great to keep busy but its hard to balance customer service and work with a deadline. The company itself can be good and bad, the location i worked in had 3 store managers in a years time, that alone can tell you a lot."
good,"In my experience, employee satisfaction is dependent on the management team as well as your position in the company. The full-time benefits are great and the pay is decent if you've performed well enough long enough to have received several annual raises. However, being part-time and minimum wage is not fulfilling for anyone. Thankfully the company has decided to start paying new employees more than minimum wage and I hope to see morale go up in the future."
good,Good place to get a college job that is on campus. Typical day is stocking shelves and helping customers check out. Busy days could be hectic with all the students needing to rent/return books in the beginning and end of semesters
good,Barnes & Noble is a great company that provides great benefits to it's employees. Paid vacations and health is always a plus
good,Great job for people who love being surrounded by books. Rotating shifts enable employees to get a chance to work alongside everybody else. Management is generally supportive. The only downside is minimal to almost nonexistent chances of career advancement and lack of job security.
good,"I work in the receiving department as an assistant to receiving manager. Accepting shipments from various delivery sources (e.g. FedEx or UPS). Scanning ASN to receive produced into automated inventory. Average shipment consists of 100 boxes depending on time of year.  I help booksellers locate books in the backroom overstock, and take care of located misplaced items and other abnormalities. "
good,Work several different shifts throughout the week. Enjoyed working with different people and would always learn something new.
good,"I actually worked for star bucks inside of Barnes and Nobles,  I learned how to make the different coffee drinks I like that and dealing with the customers was fun"
good,"It was a fun second job that was so easy, it was almost mindless. Work was very routine on a daily basis and very straight forward. The only way to get good raises was to be cross trained which hardly ever happened. I was thankful they asked me if I would like a promotion, but knew I had to turn it down because I didn't want to be stuck in retail knowing that my family lives half way across the country."
good,"At Barnes an Noble, I worked my way up from a Sales Associate in 1997 to Assistant Store Manager to an 18M Store by 2003. "
good,"Mimi's is a fine place to work. Nothing is overly difficult or demanding. Tips here aren't the best, but it could be worse. Overall, this is a good steady job."
good,"The staff was friendly and fun. it was a seasonal position during a college break. So, I didn't expect much. I had a little extra money in my pocket and that's all that matters."
good,"working at this establishment i learned multiple skills and strengths that prepared me for different work force including being a team player, being responsible, High energy and Time management"
good,"The season was fun, it can be hectic and some workers are rude but overall ok. The supervisor and manager are nice people."
good,I enjoyed my time with the company. I gained a lot of different experiences and met different people. It was a great opportunity.
good,I work in the shipping/receiving area and the café areas of the store.  A typical day includes unloading shipments from the truck.  Receiving and stocking new merchandise to be shelved and sold.  Café duties include opening and closing the café.  Strong work ethic and great customer service is required.  Preparing food and beverages to customers.
good,The job was a great learning experience for me. It helped me develop my skills as a team player. I learned how to take initiative in the work place and be more involved.
good,"I was usually by myself, closing the cafe. I never got too close with any of my managers or coworkers for this reason, which was difficult. My favorite part was the learning process since I went in with no knowledge of coffee."
good,"The West Gray location is beautiful with engaging customers. I loved  working with books, the cafe is nice also. The pay does not support an independent lifestyle"
good,It was an awesome being around people who wanted to learn about new things and wanted to read. I got to interact with people that were also touring the campus.
good,Great place to work.  Good benefits.  Great people.  Started as seasonal and was hired part time. I would keep this job if I ever got another job.  Highly recommended.
good,Work flow is steady hours are flexible though a few work days are few. Management and co-workers are friendly and helpful.
good,"My experience at Barnes and Noble wasn't the best. The managers sometimes rude to the other employees. But the other employees were quite nice. A typical day at work would include me working at the registers. I worked in the text book department before school started, so it was very busy at times.The hardest part of the job was dealing with rude customers. Since I was a new employee at the time I didn't have all the information to answer certain questions and customers would get very angry about that. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was pulling online book orders off the shelves or reshelving books."
good,"A typical day consisted of a variety of responsibilities depending on the shift worked.  Everyday consisted of customer service--using the computer database, walking customers to sections, ordering product for customers, and cash handling.  It could also include ordering product for the store, opening or closing cash handling procedures, payroll, HR tasks (vetting applications, interviews, reference checks), or shelving product."
good,"seasonal work where you may go a few months without working. Great for a college student. It was a fun working environment and during rush season, the manager took great care of the employees making sure we were comfortable and always had lunch for us during our busy time."
good,a typical day at work would include a constant flow of customers during the rush seasons; all of which have many questions that need to be answered. if you are working over 5 hours you take a 30minet break then you get back to work. the hardest part of the job is fixing a new employees error because then it means that they need be retrained. the most enjoyable part of the job is that the management will work around my schedule.
good,"Barnes and Noble provides a work environment that is far more dynamic than one would initially assume.  A typical workday could see an employee work in three or four separate departments.  Cross training is emphasized, so ability and willingness to learn on the fly is highly valuable.  Being able to prioritize tasks is a necessary skill, as the demands on a manager's or bookseller's time are both diverse and constant.  The successes within my specific store were a direct result of a partnership between the talent assembled on the management team and the quality booksellers and cafe servers on the sales floor.  Successful managers placed an emphasis on communication: whether that be coaching-in-the-moment with employees or having productive selling conversations with customers.  There are many challenges to operating this type of store in a mall environment, but by in large the team was always in position to achieve sales goals and deliver a high level of customer service.  The more recent shift towards a trend-based retail environment means a more diverse product assortment that will keep customers coming back to see what's new.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with such a great and diverse group of team members, and getting customers--both children and adults--excited about being in our store, especially during my instances of directing store events.  I place a high value on my experience within the store and feel that my time there strengthened my skill set and made me a much better manager."
good,Offers benefits only to full time positions. Although they seemed very flexible with availabilities.
good,"I was just basically a cashier. They didn't tell me when I was no longer going to be working there, they simply didn't schedule me."
good,".My co-workers were passionate about literature. Conversations with customers were often lively and enjoyable. "
good,Hours were able to work with my school schedule and management was very friendly.
good,Barnes & Noble is a gathering of great minds; where people come together and integrate thoughts until they are one idea with a strategy.
good,"Enjoy my department; overall job culture can be stressful.  As is the case with many companies you often feel understaffed and overworked, but bosses still have high expectations of performance."
good,They aim to make their Customers satisfied. It was your typical customer service call center.
good,"When hours get short, you work long days with no help.  Often alone.  Overall it used to be very pleasant to work at."
good,"Outside of the beginning of the semester, it's run at a very slow pace. There is a lot of tedious work. There is no incentive of staying long term because there are no pay raises. Unfortunately, there is a lot of favoritism that goes on. It's a place that if you need a job is okay to work but you shouldn't stay long term. It's almost a waste of time. Store manager works around your schedule but seems to forget that the workers are students and holds grudges it seems like."
good,"Everything feels pretty average, except the people.  Seeing co-workers becomes the best part of the day ."
good,"The cafe (Starbucks coffee) is busy fast-paced, repetitive, & very task oriented."
good,"employee discount was nice the environment was nice"
good,"a typical day is greeting customers and helping them with their purchases in a popular bookstore...management was decent as were the coworkers,"
good,"Barnes & Noble is a good company to work for.  It's really easy to connect with a customer as you are helping them find the perfect book.  A lot of your customers are regulars that you see almost daily and you can build a good relationship with them.  "
good,"The environment was very friendly, the staff in some ways became extended family.  It was definitely a job where you would get you put in. Thus, it pays to make yourself a valuable asset, taking advantage of every opportunity to learn and grow."
good,While work can be slow your fellow workers are usually a joy to work with.  Do to the general youth of the work force there is a lot of energy in the work place.
good,This is good company to work for. Good employees and fun place to work.
good,"I enjoyed learning all aspects of the book service industry. I learned how to receive, order, and ship book, as well as helping customers."
good,Job is either easy or difficult depending on the day of the week.
good,I learned the value of a more impersonal workplace. lack of communication with all managers.
good,"Not relevant. Prior to this career in Accounting. Retail was fun, but tough."
good,This was also a nice company to work for. This was in a call center environment.
good,learned a lot about health insurance and handing high intense calls with customers
good,"On average this job required a lot of tidying, especially for all of the different displays. Returning products to their correct places and helping customers find the right products or books. The textbook department of the store was the most difficult department to work in. It required a lot of patience while dealing with angry customers and students that didn't know what they were looking for."
good,"I've worked in retail before, but working at Barnes and Noble was different.  Each hour was something different as far as either working on projects, cashiering or shelving.  It helped make the days go by quicker.  There was pressure to sell memberships, which was never easy.  There was a lack of communication regarding open positions within the company and those who could apply for them, which was frustrating.  What made the biggest difference were the people I worked with and my managers.  All excellent and made it worth it!"
good,"Because the LSU Bookstore is directly on campus in a high-energy community where the school is the spirit of the city, I was able to meet people who shared the same goals and aspirations as I did for my school, and worked to ensure the highest customer service for each person. It was because of the management staff at this bookstore that I was able to obtain employment in Chicago at a management level. "
good,"This is not a bad place to work if you need a time in your life that will give you a stable pay check but not be too demanding of you (physically or mentally).  However, don't expect to move forward with your career...it is retail."
good,i loved reading and suggesting and discovering new books to read
good,It sharpened my interpersonal skills by meeting different people everyday
good,It is great to work at Barnes & Noble when you don't have previous work experience or a student and can only work part-time.
good,I worked there as a temporally cashier through an agency named Lloyd Staffing Agency.
good,AVI is the Cafeteria for Wayne State University Students. While working here I was responsible for cleaning dishes. I had to take the dishes off the belt. Clear the dishes from any food. Load the dish washer. I also clean restrooms and worked the register.
good,"busy during peak"
good,Good company for a recent college grad to gain retail experience. Must be willing to relocate anywhere in the country for any hopes of being considered for a management position. Great group of co-workers.
good,great atmosphere where you can get to know some of your fellow students at BSC
good,I would have stayed at this company but they were cutting my hours.
good,"on a daily basis I stocked books, returned books, and checked in books daily"
good,"Fast paced distribution center, responsible for the .com portion of the organization. Enjoyed working with the people there, made some great relationships and gained experience in distribution."
good,Learned alot. Had a good time meeting people and doing things that kept me stimulated. Great place to work.
good,I worked as a barista in the starducks in barnes and noble. My job consisted of making drinks and selling snacks to customers. It was a pretty easy laid back job.
good,Day starts at a good time and the distance from home made the commute very pleasant. Management was always involved during the course of the day and was very knowledgable of the stores workings. The co workers were students and clerks from other stores and they were very helpful as well. There wasn't much to really say that was difficult other than constant lifting of packages but it came with the job at a book store. The good thing was you got to meet new people have a good work experience.
good,My experience here was tolerable. I had a minimum of 20 hours and had overwhelming periods of time during each semester. The workload wasn't as bad when I got the routine of how things were functioning. I learned many things especially how to supervise and work with different personalities. The hardest part of the job was keeping things in order as far as ordering textbooks because I was most responsible for those being placed. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting and working with new people.
good,I enjoyed working at Barnes and Nobles Bookstore. I met some wonderful people. Management was very supportive of it's employees.
good,"I'm an avid reader, so enjoyed working at B&N.  I love helping others learn to love reading as well.  There were some unique perks while I was there, such as being able to borrow hardcover books, which was fun."
good,"Barnes & Noble has a great staff and management, fast paced environment. A typical day at work is handling paperwork, gift wall, making drinks and preparing food, taking orders and keeping the place spot on and neat. "
good,"Barnes & Noble maintains and great relationship with it's customers in providing great service, a wide selection of great product and accessories and ensuring to do what it can to meet the customer's needs."
good,"All booksellers start at minimum wage and can receive no more than a .25 cent raise a year. It varies store to store, but I experienced great managers who were understanding, and willing to work around their employees schedule. There are no part time benefits.  "
good,"worked way too hard for the way i was treated"
good,If I work the morning shift I'm responsible for getting the deposit ready for the bank.  Also setting up the cash registers for the cashiers to use for the day.  If I work the evening shift I'm responsible for closing down all the registers and making sure they have the correct amount of money in them for the bank deposit the following morning.  If any cashiers need more money I respond to calls and get them the funds they need. I'm also responsible for administrating customer refunds and some management calls. Working at Barnes & Noble I've learned how to provide great customer service. I go above and beyond to satifsfy each customer so they leave with a smile.  I've learned to cater to each customers needs and really listen attentively.  The management team at Barnes & Noble work so well together.  They are very approachable and treat everybody with complete respect.  I work with a diverse group of people.  In my position I have gained the trust of my co-workers.  I always try to support my co-workers in every circumstance. I also listen and value their opinions.  The hardest part about the job is working late at night.  The most enjoyable part of the job are the relationships you build with co-workers and customers.  
good,"Working primarily in the Music and DVD Department; cross-trained throughout entire store. Have achieved superior customer service focused upon greeting, assisting in locating items, ordering items not in stock, suggesting similar and featured artists, and answering inquiries from all resources available; additionally, have focused upon increasing efficiency while receiving shipments, ensuring all items are properly accounted, tracked, and stocked; making certain merchandising is in accordance with company directives, as well as quickly reacting to trends, both national and store-specific, to increase store revenue ; by following loss prevention guidelines, such as customer attentiveness, accurate inventory procedures, and meticulous cash handling, have solved specific problems and improved profit margins.  "
good,"Most the time work 7-8 hours in a variety of places, from cash, customer services, section, cafe, other departments. "
good,"This is a fast paced enviorment. On the plus side, I was emersed in something I completely adore; books. On the negative side, retail is ugly and Barnes and Noble is no exception. Lots of work with little appreciation. Odd hours and severly cut hours as well. "
good,the job was ok the co workers was fun to work with too bad it was seasonal i really enjoyed it
good,"Overall, it was a great place to work. Memberships are important and stressed daily, as is excelling in customer service. Multitasking and speed are imperative skills to possess as there are often long lines of customers to help. "
good,"	Provided excellent customer service above company expectations "
good,"I have been at Barnes and Nobles for almost 8 years and have been passed over for advancement about 6 times.  I do my job, come in when a shifts need to be covered and work in almost every area of the store.  When BN first introduced the Nook in 2008 I was the employee in my store who did countless research outside of work, bought the product itself because I thought it was one of the best on the market.  I promoted the per-orders of the Nook and helped customers with setting up accounts and troubleshooting.  When a new job position in charge of Nook opened I applied and was passed over so the company could hire someone who had no idea what the product was, then I was forced to train my new boss.  in my opinion Barnes and nobles is good if you are just looking for a part time job, not a career."
good,Barnes & Noble is a national company that is noted to be the largest specialty retailer in the country. It's core inventory of books and media is the best in the country. Having worked in 3 different stores I have always been impressed with the caliber of it's employees. While pay scale tends to be at the lower end of retail a superior staff is still the rule. The company is currently experiencing growing pains in an effort to stay competitive in the emerging digital market.
good,"Typical days at work will consist of arriving for my shift, logging into the cash register, and immediately ringing in customer orders. Once the line of customers has been served, I will then fill any empty or low inventory slots in the bakery case and date the products with accurate expiration dates using the FIFO model of inventory management. I will also restock cups and lids, wipe down countertops, bake cookies, take out trash, and make espresso drinks that are hot, iced, and blended creme. My coworkers are very nice people and one of the best parts of coming to work, and management is competent."
good,"Some of the skills I have learned at Barnes & Noble are management skills, scheduling of events, programs, up-selling and cross selling of product. I manage my time and tasks and assist/train part-time booksellers with their assignments."
good,Large format specialty retail is contradiction. What was lost in Customer focus and product knowledge is made up for in sheer product availability. When it works well it can be a pleasure.
good,I spent 2 years with B&N a very long time ago. I loved being surrounded by books. But the management at the location I was at was lacking. This was back about 15 years ago. I sure things have changed since then.
good,A typical day at work would consist of basically boxing book orders for students. I learned how to work a cash register and how to act/talk in the workplace. There really wasn't a hard part of the job. The most enjoyable was just coming into work. I loved working there.
good,"A typical day at work with the University of South Florida Barnes and Noble involved going downstairs and opening, labeling, putting away incoming book shipments according to class sections, professors, and area of study. It also focused heavily on customer service as our traffic in the store was always packed due to end of the semester and the incoming semester. The hardest part of the job was the slow period when we did not have very much to do in the morning and the most enjoyable (and sometimes stressful) was when the store was packed. That was enjoyable because at the end of your shift, one felt fulfilled that they had a solid work day assisting people. We had to be able to efficiently serve customers who had varying levels of understanding what they needed. I learned to adapt quickly to fast paced work environments and to always, always give the customer the best experience you can."
good,Though this job was to be temporary i was able to stay on as full time as well as advance in the company.
good,"On a typical day, I would interact with customers both over the phone and in person, taking care of bulk and individual book orders, keeping track of them, making sure they were processed correctly and quickly. I entered a great deal of data into the computer system, including teachers' information, or information on new accounts. I did a great deal of troubleshooting: resolving customer issues. For example, if a customer had not received the correct book or was having trouble with an order, the problem was referred to me for resolution. I answered any calls asking about setting up institutional or school accounts, and also created invoices when necessary."
good,"Since 2001, I have had the privileged of working for a great organization. The management was very flexible and willing to work with me around my school schedule. Worked in various sections of the store. Met a lot of great people."
good,Everyday was similar and predictable. The management was overworked and often unavailable to assist customers. Barnes and Noble did not promote within and that policy made customer assistance challenging.
good,Barnes and Noble was a productive place to work. There were plenty of people that are willing to mentor new employees.
good,Cash wrap:
good,"management is not consistant, breaks their own rules, and is unprofessional."
good,"a typical day at work is just helping the customers and making sure their satisfied. i've learned alot about customer service, what to say and wat not to say; i've learned to be a leader. the management to me could have been a little cleaner and more professional. my co-workers were tolerable at times. the hardest part of the job was dealing with the rude customers that would come into the store. the most enjoyable part of the job was clocking out to go home!!!."
good,"worked everyday doing paperwork completey alone at the computer terminal has to be very productive, doing differnt jobs task at the same time eg .( cashiers, buyback window& supervisor all at one) fun friday."
good,"Job entailed maintaining overall store appearence helping with cusomers, cashering"
good,I worked for BN for over 19 years and found it to be most rewarding.
good,"Helping others, especially loyal customers find their next escape(fiction) or something to enhance their reality(non-fiction)"
good,"Was one of the members who helped piece the store together, should do it again in a heartbeat"
good,The stores can get quite busy. Not enough employees to handle the amount of business the stores receive on a daily basis. Pay is not great. Co-workers and management team are great. Hardest part of the job is picking up and recovering during extremely busy nights like bookfairs.
good,"Spent more money than I made, twice as much! Employee discount is nice at Starbucks in store...."
good,"Good benefits, store discount. A good atmosphere of books and those who love them."
good,"-i realy enjoy this job, it fun and high energy. the managers and my coworkers are great and freindly."
good,"Tasks are easy. Management is at least decent, mostly good. Discount is nice. Its great to be around people who have a passion for reading/books. Managers seek people who work well with others and are considerate of their coworkers. Day consists of one or many of the following: placing product, cashiering, receiving product, customer service, organizing product, heavy lifting (for a few tasks)."
good,Café and book side are treated and handled differently. I did not feel I got adequate training or support in the café specifically. Book side/general management was very kind but the café left much to be desired
good,"I worked in the cafe, and it was typical food service/barista work. Customers were either snobby and entitled or incredibly nice. There was a big push to get memberships, but that's not something that's easy to do in the cafe since people are typically only there for the coffee, and saving 10% on a $3 coffee doesn't really sell memberships. There was a big discrepancy between corporate and the actual managers I worked with every day. The managers were generally kind and understanding, and would take time to speak with you as a team rather than just as your boss. Corporate was obviously very disconnected from the everyday work we did and would come in and be all intimidating and arrogant to us lowly wage workers. In this day, making the amount I did, even part time, is unacceptable. Especially for such a large corporation. We did get a 30% discount which I'm hearing used to be 50 and is now going up to 40. We did not get any free food or drink even if working in the cafe (besides water). I had to spend a lot of my paycheck on getting food for lunch. Then, at the end of the day, all the pastries and food that was going down had to be thrown in the trash. Nobody is allowed to take it home and we did not donate it anywhere. Just lots of food thrown in the trash. Overall, my experience with my store was complicated. I loved my coworkers and my managers were great, but the overall culture of the company is out of touch."
good,"The managers were/are great, the atmosphere was/is great for any book lover, but the flexibility in scheduling and pay is not there for someone with real responsibilities/bills."
good,I was hired as a temporary (90 day) part time employee. You only get minimum wage to lug all those books around & being on your feet all day. I did like that I was given early morning hours (4am-10am) because it really made me feel like I had work/life balance.
good,"Barnes & Noble is a decent company. Management tends to be understanding, and HR reacts to employee issues in a timely manner. Like many retailers, the company does not offer significant pay, and the lack-luster benefits are for full-time employees only. Opportunities for advancement are slim. The company has suffered in recent years from CEO turnover, creating a lack of vision. Often Barnes & Noble feels like a company clinging to its past successes."
good,"I worked at the cafe inside a Barnes and Noble. It was incredibly fast paced. My fellow employees were fun to work with though. They also promoted me pretty quick. However, it's a pretty strict work environment. Everything is under and key; discounts, organization, special promo's."
good,"Managers were nice, lots of hours to pick up. They dismissed full time people because there wasn't enough profit. Only thing I didn't like was pushing the membership on to customers."
good,My experience working at barnes and noble was just alright. Luckily you get to learn about a lot of great books and help customers find what they are looking for . The system was chaotic and often disorganized and finding books can be a real chore. Customers often run out of patience if the book is not on hand.
good,"Given a choice, I chose the Children’s Section. The managers were hardly there and I wasn’t as familiar with the books as I thought.  I was trained on the cash register using the manual; I was told I was too slow. I loved answering the phone and helping customers but I was barred from doing that. Stocking books was difficult because I wasn’t familiar with the store. I’m not good at retail."
good,"A relaxed environment, no room for advancement. But, a very good place to work the team was a great group of people to work with.I  would recommend this employer to all of my friends."
good,I was was only a temporary cashier and sales associate but I still felt like it was barely even part time and the pay was low. I didn't get a full shift although the manager was a friendly person.
good,Barnes and Noble is a typical retail establishment.  Hours are tightly controlled and advancement is not quick in coming.  Some managers tend to be lazy and rely on others to lead.
good,"It was constant, repetitive work though it wasn't to the point that I wanted to rip my hair out. The pay however is extremely low but you receive great discounts on books and especially the cafe"
good,As a specialty store for entertainment items there was a lot of customer service required. However the customers and employees shared a love of the product and made for great interactions.
good,"This is a good company to work for if you are a student or can only work part-time. The only way to have a full-time position here is if you are a manager."
good,"Working in the Barnes & Noble cafe in the NYC area is not recommended for everyone, as we are typically understaffed and it is a very fast-paced environment where you will be expected to handle numerous customers at once all on your own."
good,"A good place to start your work experience. Working in the cafe, you do have room to move up but takes time like with most places of employment.  You'll find that the staff is more enjoyable than the job itself."
good,Its a great enviroment. Management is friendly. Understanding to a point. Its fun to work there. The other employees are friendly and helpful. It like one big family.
good,"The number one thing to know if you want to work here is that you're going to be dealing with a lot of crazies. That is, people with very obscure and specific requests that don't have any patience when their expectations aren't met immediately with a book in their hand."
good,"Barnes and Noble has been one of my favorite jobs so far. It is great for people getting a first job. Pay could be better. Other than the pay, it was a fun environment!"
good,Great part time job while in school. Great discount. Fun to work with others who are into books. Emphasis on a sales-driven culture. Can get stressful when short-staffed and managers want you to do everything.
good,Boring during some hours but too much of a push to sell memberships. I liked that I could go to school and still have a job. Had favoritism towards who got the most hours.
good,"Best part of the day is the slowest as you just chill and help the few guest wandering around, and talking with co-workers."
good,I liked working here. All my coworkers were chill the management was decent although they would sometimes get worked up over sales which is understandable but for a PT college student I didn't care enough to feel bad that we weren't selling because of Amazon. Most of the money is coming from the books so I don't know why they'd pressure the Barista's into upselling .40 cent coffee cups.
good,worked with many great co workers- additional training only available to those who a supervisor selects to receive training-  has an old school woman's club click  -if you are on a team that is being eliminated they will not try to place you an a thriving team--  they just can you and keep the lower paid newer employees
good,"If you are a college student looking for a job on campus, there would be none better than working for the bookstore."
good,"Pros:"
good,"The times have changed a bit, at Barnes and Noble. It was quite a fun job when I started there. The staff still tends to be the reason to come to work, but the overall amount of pressure has slowly ramped up to the point its a bit ridiculous. Still, if you love books and a bookstore atmosphere, its worth it."
good,"BN is one of the most varied places to work it's almost unbelievable. When you're busy there isn't enough help, there are more demands than normal and the stress levels drive you to the point of quitting. When the slow season hits there's nothing to do and it feels like you have too many people working. "
good,"management was soso, and managing your responses to your boss was laborious half the time but was reasonable the other half. "
good,"Barnes and Noble has difficulty navigating changes to the retail and media industries and evolving customer expectations. As an employee, this can be frustrating as goals can change frequently and with little notice or clear direction."
good,"During rushes, the day was full and interactive with students and staff. The lulls were always busy working on the next semester. Always bust either helping students or faculty."
good,"If you have a good manager, Barnes and Noble is a great place to be, though the industry is dying and corporate doesn't know which way is up.  "
good,when it ones to this company and location it is a very up and down environment. Management needs a lot of work on sticking to the rules and making sure each employee follows and is not selective about who needs to follow it more than others. And in terms of management being consistent is off as well. all different managers ask and require different things. so you never know how your day is going to go. I also feel management should be better role models in terms of how they want the store to be run. Or be more willing to give a helping hand when needed. But some of them are very good at communicating in terms of their employees and are able to connect with them. making the work and environment easier to tell with. and be able to bring issues and problems to them very easily. in terms of work load. I feel they point out a few people in the store to work a section in the store and only have those few trained on it. so they are the only ones able to do those certain things. so when one person wants to take over they cant. or when one person is tired of doing the same thing every day no one is able to relieve them from their spot. So it's an on and off. You never know who you are going to get and what they are going to expect from them on a daily basis.  The customers are pretty much the same as any retail you will get good and bad. the culture again is based on who is managing the store that day. the hardest part would be doing things in their timely want and need.being able to do multiple projects in a shift on their time frame. The best part would have to be the few friendships
good,"Pros"
good,"This job was not fast-paced enough to keep my attention. It was peaceful and quiet, but there was no competition and there was no incentive to succeed, as I recall."
good,"First of all, it is all about sales! Sell the books, memberships, gift cards, etc. You can do this if you enjoy engaging customers are good at not taking ""no"" for an answer."
good,The company was great to work for at one point family oriented. They worked as a family and cared about the employees. But I guess like anything else. The big picture took over and lead to bad decisions.. Of course when that happens the little guy gets the bad part.  A lot of us were outsourced just because even though the outsourcing company didn't have the people to do our jobs. ..
good,"I greatly enjoyed working for the company as a whole. I learned many valuable retail management skills that can be put to use for other companies. Unfortunately, the manager I work under is not as committed to the success of the business as I am and that has caused me to start seeking other employment. I also believe my management skills and experience combined with my culinary experience can help me in finding a higher paying position."
good,"Obviously stores vary, and so do the personnel, I really enjoyed the people I worked with. I got to meet some really nice people. But the culture that the head office forces down the managers' throats make it a less than appealing place to work. I understand they don't necessarily agree with every policy and that it is their job to implement them. However, the head office should listen to their low level employees more as we are the ones helping them make money."
good,Barnes and Noble takes care of their employees. It is a good place to work and you will feel valued by your employers. Working in the cafe can be stressful but fun as well.
good,I like working here. It's like a family. Coworkers are great. I like being around books all day. It's flexible around my school schedule and home life schedule.
good,"I like working at Barnes & Noble. My problems are that I work in the Music Department and they are getting rid of it. The store manager right now is terrible, she is supposed to be temporary but may be the full time Store Manager. She supports getting rid of the Music Department and is an awful leader. She never introduced herself to me when she came into my department and no one likes her. All the other managers are great. I work very few hours and am being told that HR wants to lower my pay due to that. The pay is low and that's one of the problems. Everybody that works there is really nice."
good,"Good place for a first job or a job for a college student. The management culture is great, and the Barnes & Noble employees try to make new workers feel welcome."
good,There is nothing more annoying than a required review of a company that I worked at for less than 4 months. I think this entire process is complete and utter garbage.
good,"I stocked & inventoried Audio Books, CD's & Dvd's. I helped putting up displays & cashiered customer purchases in a timely & professional manner. I leaned about the literary & operations world of business. the workplace was congenial. Sometimes specific items weren't delivered on time to customers disappointment.The enjoyable part of the job was seeing customer happy about our customer service."
good,Barnes and Noble College allowed me to have a flexible schedule during school semesters. Provided me with wage increases and opportunities to move up in the store.
good,"Working at B&N College was rewarding. I learned how to work in retail and work with people. However much I enjoyed it as I met students and staff and got to greet people , it wasn't helpful. I was a student and it became hard to keep my hours with my studies. I know it was the same for my peers and the managers at the time were not helpful or accommodating to the fact that we are student workers and not full time employees."
good,"Take the good with the bad, enjoyable to talk books with customers but hate working nights weekends and especially holidays.  Corporate is always trying new procedures and policies, sometimes it feels like they have never worked in a store before."
good,"I have enjoyed working at Barnes & Noble, you work in just about every part of the store, Café, register, textbooks, and the backroom. Most difficult would be working hard, and not rewarded."
good,Enjoyed daily interaction with both shifts and developed a strong management team that worked collectively to meet or exceed all goals and targets. worked with all directors and VP to address policy and planning needs.
good,Good work life balance and time off policy.  Nice people.  Good IT support and overall organizational functionality.  I would not have left the company if I wasn't moving out of state.
good,Extremely fast paced. Customers are always in a rush. People call out sick all time. Managers are ok but have way too many responsibilities on their plate to focus on the customers and employee development.
good,"Management wasn't really on task about things or wasn't around when you needed them. I didn't mind working there but now I been hearing bad things if you are working there. I would not recommened working there, shopping is okay."
good,"Old Barnes and Noble concentrated on authentic selling and being a supportive, helpful, and fun environment for customers and employees to partake in. However, over the past seven years, the company has been going through big growing pains. In particular, figuring out how to compete with Amazon and other online retailers. This has lead to corporate having a strong disconnect with their employees and many of their customers. They are trying to find their footing in an uncertain retail world.  They are having trouble finding a CEO who knows ""the book business"" and who can run it well, and they are struggling with how to evolve (relying on gifts and toys and games to pad nook and book losses), and trying to build corporate and educational contacts to gain bulk sales and stay essential to their communities. The unique retail niche that is Barnes and Noble, (store, library, community center) is interesting to run but very challenging to be everything to everyone."
good,"I'm very passionate about books, so really enjoyed that part of the job. Most customers are friendly and love recommendations for good books. Turnover, was a bit of a problem. I believe the low pay contributed to that issue, especially with the expectation of open availability and the work that is required."
good,"A step above your average retailer.  B&N is an employee-centric company that asks a lot of its employees, but provides a fun and personal atmosphere."
good,"The majority of the day is task driven, completing projects, putting stock away and cleaning up after customers. Expectations always increase and staff continues to decrease."
good,"Though there were people there that were cool employees, there were some who made working more harder to do. Some were a distraction and would blame others for their mistakes."
good,"My work days have changed over time since I was hired. I initially came on as a shelver, just putting the books on the shelves every day for my entire shift. As the seasons changed and we had less stock to get on the shelves I was given the opportunity to learn other jobs such as overseeing the children's department, helping customers at customer service, taking old stock off the shelves, etc. My co-workers have been incredibly helpful in this, I can ask any of them a question and they'll either help or find someone who can help. If you can trade shifts around you can get hours where you're primarily doing the kind of jobs you prefer. But the hours are very limited."
good,"It is fairly easy to hold a job here. Typically, you could be scheduled to do anything from stocking to cashiering. This is an on-campus bookstore where the clientele is typically either visitors buying school spirit clothing or college students buying either textbooks or something from the cafe. This results in large rushes during the beginning and end of the semester and during football games. Other than that, the store can be fairly slow. "
good,"The fellow employees were pleasant to work with and many customers were enjoyable and curious to know more about the books that were available and newly published."
good,"Nice place to work, very dynamic environment that allowed to learn new technologies, very professional and cooperative co-workers, however, no job security due to low demand for the product on the market"
good,Your job is laid out for you in terms of what your expected to do. Hours can be random if your part time and can make it a little difficult planning life events. Overall a good place to work while looking for other opportunities.
good,A typical day is good but that depends on the customers. It's good as a temporary job but the advancement/raises are nothing great. I would say the most enjoyable part of the day is seeing a customer find that one book they were trying so hard to find. The hardest part is dealing with an unruly customer or trying to explain something they are not understanding.
good,Great way to develop customer service and computer skills. Loved the friendly staff and diverse employees. Hardest part is keeping up with the rush and buyback times of the school year.
good,Its the perfect job i just wish it wasn't just temporary. But for a job to help while going to school its a very good way to make money on the side.
good,I have been with the company for many years and the benefits are great.  The problem is trying to advance to a higher position.  There are always 5-6 people in line for one opening and many times hiring does not happen from within the company.
good,"Although this job is interesting - it does not pay the bills."
good,BarnesnandNoble.com is great for being a mid-sized company that feels much like a small company in terms of workplace culture.
good,"Good place to work most days, aside from people who believe they don't need help. The hours are not there if it's not RUSH as well."
good,"It's easy, it's quiet, and most of all, it's unfulfilling. The managers try and stress how hectic this job gets, but even on it's busiest days it's dull. The cash wrap is super easy, customer service can get a little annoying but customers are usually extremely patient. Putting books back where they belong is probably the most challenging thing to grasp at first but even that quickly becomes easy. You do have metric goals but there really is no incentive other than to please your manager; no commission, no personal awards, and no guaranteed advancement."
good,"On a typical day, the customer base was very diverse, mainly because it was on a college campus; this is something I found high desireable. I learned how to work with other cultures and ethnicities, how to listen to subtle differences in the ways people pronounce words.Most importantly I learned that these cultures aren't as uncivilized and barberic as the Discovery channel portrays!"
good,"Good work-life balance, great culture, smart co-workers, collaborative environment, free lunches."
good,Good Structure. Doesn't have all the high end operational systems needed to manage a store.
good,"I really do enjoy my job. Most of the management is supportive and pleasant to work with. As a head cashier I receive medical and dental insurance, as well as decent vacation and paid time off. That said, the pay is severely lacking and less than market value, "
good,My only problem working here is that the upper echelon of management (district and higher) had little to no interest in advancing those that already worked in the store. Experience meant very little to those at the highest level. They moved slowly and ineffectively to replace our inventory manager. They passed over two of the most experienced employees to hire someone with no experience and offered no reason.
good,"basically exactly what you would expect from any other retail/sales position in a major merchandise store.  Show up, keep your stuff in order, make the customers happy, clean up at the end of the day and do it all over again.  Absolutely nothing wrong with that, and working with a book seller is a lot more interesting than other retail fields. My lunch breaks I would sometimes never leave the store, just grab a book and sit in the café."
good,"I was hired for the Christmas season and received fantastic hours. As soon as the season ended, I went fro 38 hours a week to 9 hours a week. If they're going to give their employees such awful hours, they may as well let them go."
good,"At work I was required to be a cashier, a general merchandiser, answer phones, clean and restock shelves. I had two managers who basically hid in their offices until an endcap needed to be built or we had some sort of crisis at check out. The hardest part of my job was having to defer to a manager to do something as simple as a return or exchange. I did love the fact that we were involved in arranging products and displays and being creative."
good,"Everything was perfect....then new management moved in....and it turned into a different store almost instantaneously. Watch out, just cover your back in every way you can and don't for a second think that you're ""cool."""
good,"A typical day would differ depending on where I was working, but I was usually in the receiving department. Each day we would get a shipment of boxes that we would unpack and prepare for shelving the next day. If there was time after the shipment was over, generally we would pack return shipments to publishers or shelve the books and give the booksellers more time to finish other projects. What I learned from Barnes and Noble was how to work a PDT handheld scanner, how to order books and other media to be sent to the customer or to our store, how to work in all areas of the store, and how to properly process incoming and outgoing shipments from the receiving department. Management was good at listening to employee concerns, but was occasionally stymied by corporate in addressing those concerns. My co-workers were some of the best people I've ever dealt with and have made many friends as a result of working there for so long. The hardest part of the job was trying to get promoted from within the store, as most times management or corporate tended to have an incoming transfer lined up to take an open management or section lead position. The most enjoyable part was the interacting with my coworkers and seeing what new books came is, as well as being able to unbox and shelve the product as it arrived."
good,Typical day at work was merchandise and customer services.Reliable team member dependable mature and fast learner.They have good managers ability to work well with others co worker.Love what you do in your job for me is very important .
good,"Worked as a music seller. A lot of down time, CD's these days aren't flying off the shelf's. Nice place to work, great people, management is well educated.  "
good,"Every shift is different, whether you are opening the cafe, doing a mid day shift, or closing the cafe. Every shift has difficult but doable expectations. "
good,"In the context of retail in general, BN is a good company to work for."
good,"Challenging place to work with a myriad of interesting customers. Wonderful coworkers, but management could be challenging at times, even when you were a part of the team. Love of books, reading, and matching each customer to the perfect book was a must. Sending customers, especially children, home with a book they were excited to read made each day worth coming in for."
good,Great benefits even if the actual compensation is low. Excellent co-workers. A lot of cross-training so it gives you a lot of experience in different areas in future jobs. Definitely a good place to start employment but would not expect a long-term career.
good,"Company is on the decline. Great place to work, ensures great home life. Pay is under current market value for positions offered. No chance for advancement."
good,"Merchandising,customer support, requires open availability for FT"
good,"My experience at this store was quite fun, but there were no benefits for part-time employees, unless they worked there for a year. I liked the managers, but there were times when we would run out of supplies that were essential to our job, which would make it difficult to bring up our daily sales."
good,"The company was very organized, kinda old school with the ancient registers. Supervisors were kind, helpful and patient"
good,"As a sales associate, you are able to assist students with getting their books for the upcoming semesters and assisting in online orders. It is a wonderful opportunity to get to know the campus. It is also a great opener to begin sales experience and customer service training for young adults. Hours are very flexible to work with class schedules and management is wonderful."
good,I enjoy working here. Unfortunately the last few years have seen several changes in upper management which leads to a whole new way to do things every 8 months or so. Hoping the new owners can balance it out.
good,"often the goals the management would put forward for you to meet would be impossible amidst the customers who needed assistance, especially after they removed the customer terminals to look up books."
good,Low job security company sales is bad. Not to look as a career. Good job to learn skills from room for growth is verh minimal due to the company continues to downsize
good,"Better than most retail positions, especially if you enjoy books and reading in general. That makes it much easier to assist customers looking for books. Has the general issues with dealing with the public in a retail setting, but nothing out of the ordinary."
good,B&N is a great place to work part time while in school.  It’s easy to get time off and the managers really look out for you when a customer goes too far. The training program is a bit messy. I definitely had to teach myself most of the things.
good,a typical workday would usually be decided at the beginning of the week. the supervisor would direct each employee to a specific job area in the warehouse to work for the rest of week. management was pretty good and the workplace had a pretty relaxed yet productive atmosphere.
good,"I was hired as a bookseller but unknowingly ended up taking on two more positions as a cashier and customer service representative. I would say that the work is not hard at all you just have to be really good with customer service. The environment is very relaxed as long as you do your job in selling memberships and day to day responsibilities. The manager is generally laid back as well. However, you can and WILL get released and replaced if need be so do not get to comfortable."
good,"A typical day in my position entails forensic research of customer claims; order history and fulfillment, payment transactions, inventory management as well as proposing amicable resolutions to complex customer service issues that benefit both the customer and the company as a whole."
good,"I honestly don't remember much of working there. I was just a wee lad. I just remember that everything was really expensive, I had to pay if I wanted any coffee even though I never did (yes I stole espresso), and my immediate manager was super chill and stole coffee with me."
good,"It's fun to work at Barnes & Nobles but the pay is very low and little job advancement. The managers are very friendly with you and keep things professional as well. They sometimes pressure you to sell memberships but they do it in a positive way and not in a negative way. Which works because if it was negative pressure, we wouldn't be getting any memberships. Co-workers are all good friends outside of Barnes and Noble. Culture in the store is really fun and friendly. Sometimes customers can be rude but you shouldn't let that get to you. You're mostly walking and standing up. In your shift you're either in Receiving, Customer Information Desk, Kids Dept, or Cashiering."
good,"The people I work with are great. Really friendly atmosphere between employees. Sometimes management can be a bit overbearing, but usually within reason. Meeting quotas is very important, which can be a bit of pain. Good first time job; I learned a lot about customer service and the retail industry. Can be a bit stressful at times, especially during the holidays."
good,"The culture at Barnes and Noble Store 2840 made it feel like my second home. My coworkers were like my family. Members of management, while often overworked and stressed, were great. They were compassionate about emergencies, yet they were firm when they needed to be. The hardest part about the job was balancing loss prevention on top of all the other responsibilities that were expected of booksellers and managers. There were times it felt like we ""babysat"" shoplifters more than anything else, but I think it was partially due to the store's location. The most enjoyable part about the job was forming bonds with my coworkers. I loved the spirit days during the holidays that served as a sort of Holiday Countdown which helped relieve the stress from the holidays. I loved the special national story times every Saturday. This is a great place to work, and I wish I could have stayed a bit longer."
good,"As a university student (I technically work for B & N College) there isn't a whole lot I can do to advance in my current position. My one big complaint is a lack of hours. I enjoy my job, though."
good,"I really do enjoy working here, and the people i work with. Very much a work family. It's Corporate's views and values that make it hard to want to stay. With their recent and unexpected cut of all full time employees, part-timers like myself are expected to pick up the extra work load on top of their expectations of work ethic. Corporate is just trying to save the company but are absolutely not putting their employees first."
good,"Just like any corporate retail store the employees at store level are not respected by the corporate office. The company continually increases demands on the store without providing the stores the resources needed to succeed."
good,"Do to the restructuring of the company, job future is not a certain."
good,"For students or those seeking only part-time employment OR for those in higher management positions such as Store Manager or beyond, it can be a great job in almost every category. Excellent environment, low-stress customers, consistently friendly and welcoming management and co-workers, flexible scheduling 3 weeks in advance so you can plan your life. However, for those in middle-management or supervisor/lead positions the pay is nowhere near acceptable for the quantity and quality of work demanded, and that quantity grows every single year with more and more cuts to other avenues of aid, from regular staffing to support services, with absolutely no increase in pay or benefits to the employee. In other words, you will be constantly asked to do more than your job with no compensation or extra time offered. On top of that the industry is not stable at the retail level so some full-time positions are not guaranteed to still be available."
good,"You'll be paid better as a manager versus just being a bookseller, but if it is a temp/summer job and you really love books, then you'll probably enjoy working for B & N."
good,"Things are changing, so is our culture. Less hours to accomplish the same amount of work or more. Team culture is excellent . Benefits are best in retail."
good,"I enjoyed my benefits, but was asked to have too much responsibility for the pay. My store's staff was pretty great, customers were not the nightmares I had heard about, but there were always a few exceptions. "
good,"Lack of advancement, poor training, management is never very clear or not very often will you find one that is. Staff can be friendly if caught at the right time and place. Workplace environment varies depending on staff members at the time and their mood. Very hard to get things done and to focus. Very nice place to learn and to get discounts, meet new people and to also find yourself."
good,"Do not go into a career with Barnes and Noble thinking that you will advance. You cannot plan for the future. There has been a steady decline in sales and avaible positions. Amazon and lead competition is taking over and BN cannot keep up. This was my most favorite job and I made best friends. I gained a work family, with coworkers and customers in the store. I was laid off this past week, shockingly and randomly. My dreams crumbled in a split second. I find myself unemployed with no health insurance. This is the most terrifying experience of my life. Look else where if you are seeking full time employment with benefits. Do not plan on building your life around this career. My heart is broken."
good,"This is a relaxed, comfortable workplace. It is a good first job for someone looking to get their foot in the door in the retail world. I would recommend this job to teenagers and young adults looking for a part time job with lower hours."
good,Overall it is a good place to work but the company is undergoing major changes and this is causing lots of stresses in pretty much all areas.  Even with this it is on the more laid back side of retail
good,I worked in the cafe rather than as a bookseller. I wish I would have worked on the floor instead. Working in the cafe can get extremely stressful. You spend a lot of time wondering why you're understaffed. Something that would boost morale in the cafe would be allowing servers to recieve tips from customers. Not sure why there isn't a tipping system already in place.
good,"If you want to work retail, work here."
good,"Hardly any hours regardless of how many times I've asked, great employees and workspace but not a high enough pay or enough time to support oneself let alone a family."
good,"I believe I  this company, but the focus on arbitrary metrics as a measure of success is detrimental to the company as a whole. Being expected to sell 4 memberships every full time shift isn't attainable. "
good,"I work with the kids department. I loved working with the books and doing projects with the kids. I learned about children, as well as work ing in other departments. I also work closely using the register"
good,"I work at a fantastic store full of great people and a bunch of regular customers.  I think my store is very welcoming, mostly because my store manager is a dream and creates a team environment where everyone has each other's backs.  I love that I work with a lot of different people, and I've learned a lot in my time here. There is a lot of training and managers will work with you on different training programs depending on what position you're interested in.  "
good,This is a retail enviroment that is fun and fast paced compared to other retailers. It is customer serviced based and they have fun events for the customers based around new books and movies that are coming out.
good,"The hardest part of the job is the rush season when students return back to start a new semester. The lines can get ridiculous, especially with those using financial aid to make their purchases. "
good,"I clock in and start to do the basic chores, arrange boxes, books, drinks and food in the fridge. Organize books in orders they should be, help the delivery man with the unloading of books. Then start to help customers with what books they are looking for.Learned how to deal with crowds effectively. The hardest part of the job is the pay after a week or two."
good,"It's a bookstore, I think that says a lot. It's a quite place of work. At times one would have a rush but as soon as it starts it's over. I really enjoyed working here."
good,"Overall, working at B&N was fun with the crew (including Management) and had it's crazy busy days like any other retail store; nothing we could not handle."
good,"I wish I could review B&N higher because it's truly a fun place to work and the work you do can be very rewarding personally—being able to help someone find their new favorite book is a great feeling."
good,"I've spent a little over a year as a seasonal bookseller, then part time bookseller. I've enjoyed the discounts and where I work and who I work with. What I don't like is how they barely give hours. Corporate is also disconnected from what makes a company and store thrive by controlling everything and not giving store more freedom or the information on demographics and marketing information that can make a store do what will work best for that area. "
good,Had a great experience working here.  The management team was very on top of things.  Easy to get time off when needed and was able to get time off for school.
good,"Sales allowed me to build strong relationships with customers. Management arbitrarily made scheduling as tedious and rigid as possible; requesting days off for important reasons were next to impossible. Management guilted many of us for doing so, which was unnecessary."
good,Typical day at work included selling memberships and dealing with various people at a fast pace. Knowing where everything is in the store is extremely helpful because people constantly walk up asking questions about where certain things are placed.
good,Barns & Noble offered the opportunity to engage the public with the love of books couples with the ability to communicate recommendations of favorite books.
good,"Typical day at Barnes and Noble was either working the cash register for the whole shift, or being behind the scenes making drinks and food for awaiting customers."
good,"Took care of daily tasks"
good,"My day included staying at the register and maintaining my area. I worked primarily in the textbook department where the TCC students would come cash out with their financial aid. The employees there were are nice and I met a few others who had returned for the season. My biggest problem with this store is that training was poorly done. A lot of things were not explained so much as expected of me. I was not introduced to the whole management team and I ended up being flustered whenever a customer problem would come up as certain things were not explained to me. My advice to you, if you are trying to work there full time, is that you avoid working there seasonally and try working there when full time employment becomes available to you."
good,"During a period of major change to the retail environment, bookselling in particular, B&N offered me an opportunity to grow as a manager, and experience what strong customer service should look like. Almost everyone I worked with or who worked for me was a dedicated professional that left a lasting impression upon me. Despite a difficult commute and hectic work schedule, I always looked forward going into work."
good,"I'm happy with the company strategies and fellow employees abilities via the HR process. Biggest challenge is definitely not the traditional competiton, but the outrageous rent increases in NYC for every business facing end of lease negotiations."
good,I loved Barnes and Noble. Leading a bookstore is pretty much the best job ever. Upper management is not very communicative with their visions. No room for growth for an ASM. They traditionally hire Store Manager's from the outside.
good,"Fun work place with great staff, but people outside of the company do not realize how much we put into it. the misconception is that if you work at barnes and noble, you are reading all day long! Thats not true, we work very had to present the store in the best way possible so that our customers can enjoy a great shopping experience! One of my favorite things about working here is the interaction with the customers, especially those who are loyal readers to certain genres. Talking to them is always interesting and you both leave that conversation with 100 more books to read!"
good,Barnes & Noble is a good company overall to work for.  I've been with them for 11 years and have learned and grown from the experiences I've had.
good,People who were temporary had to do the majority of the workload. I felt like because I was temporary I had to work harder while those who had a part time position were more relaxed.
good,"a typical day would be walking in, clocking in, and letting my manager know that i was there. then the manager would take me to a room where all the money was kept and take out a drawer for me to count and then take me to my register, log on and then i was on my way for the rest of my shift. management was okay i can say.. can be a bit different there is always room for improvement."
good,"-STOCKING"
good,You'll make friends with your co-workers and they'll be your second family. Management is pretty good with most people knowing how to properly do their job but unfortunately there is no room for job advancement. The hardest part of the job is dealing with annoying customers and they most enjoyable part of the job is your co-workers. The pay is minimum wage with very few benefits out of which the best is probably the discount on merchandise.
good,"TYPICAL DAY"
good,"Fun and productive environment, mainly customer service and stocking."
good,"If you don't LOVE books, you need not apply. That is what you'll be doing all day, every day. Selling books."
good,"I like working at Barnes and Noble but wish I was paid more. The hours are flexible which helps while I am in school and management is generally good. "
good,"This is a good job for a young person who is just starting out. It teaches valuable skills, such as being detail oriented and working with a team. The team can also be a joy to work with."
good,The job was good. I enjoyed my co-workers. I enjoyed the books.
good,"I am the Community Relations Manager at a local bookstore."
good,"Barnes and Noble College is a fairly good company, in terms of business models and procedures. They treat their customers well and they are always seeking to improve their business. The company is fairly easy to work up in, and rewards hard workers."
good,"Barnes & Noble is a wonderful place to work... if you don't need the money. In all seriousness, the quality of life is fantastic, the people are friendly and personable, and the atmosphere is enjoyable. The only downside is the compensation -- most employees start at minimum wage and annual merit raises are typically minimal."
good,"I worked in the cafe, worst part is that there is constant confusion with customers unaware that the cafe is not an actual Starbucks. The cafe serves Starbucks coffee, not an actual Starbucks franchise."
good,"Flexible schedule, great environment (if you love books).  There were some wonderful events. Opportunity to move up within the company."
good,"Place where customer service and attention to details comes first!"
good,"A typical day of work would begin by receiving the daily shipment, consisting of 120 to 140 packages on average, ensuring that the count matched what was expected to be delivered.  Additional shipments from UPS, FedEx, and third-party carriers would also be received in a similar manner later in the day.  It was then my responsibility to process these shipments, delegating tasks to my employees to see that everything was accurately received.  I was also responsible for processing outgoing shipments (i.e. returns, customer orders).  In this position, I was able to expand and improve upon my managerial and customer relation skills.  The hardest part of this job was to schedule the help necessary to finish the tasks listed above on a daily basis while working within a strict payroll budget.  Management was exceedingly friendly and very easy to work with.  However, I often felt as though there was a lack of communication amongst the store manager and assistant managers.  My co-workers were a collection of kind, fantastic individuals, making them the most enjoyable part of this job."
good,"Barnes & Noble in Stamford is a very interesting place to come to work. Many of my co-workers are very interesting people, coming from all walks of life. My managers are very supportive, interesting people. Seldom do they get stressed out with their employees, but nothing serious. A typical day would consist of manning the Customer Service desk, attending to customers that need help finding a book; either in person or on the phone. Along with, covering the breaks of other employees in other departments, along with occasionally helping managers with side projects in the store. The most stressful part of the job is that there is no real consistency with receiving hours if you are a part-time worker. One week you might have 18 hours and the next it might drop down to 10. But the part I enjoy most is talking with other co-workers about intellectually stimulating topics in an atmosphere that encourages expanding your horizons through books."
good,A typical day in the receiving department is to receive all incoming boxes delivered to store. Making sure boxes are all accounted for. Sort product and ensure items are ready for shelvers/booksellers to shelve and merchandise on displays. Keeping area clean and organized. Assist booksellers as well as customers. Process any out going customer orders.
good,I worked at Barnes and Noble several years ago
good,"A typical work day is consistent of restocking the floor, maintaining inventory and assisting customers when needed. I learned how to multitask efficiently and how to adapt to a fast pace environment. Management is professional and enjoyable to work with. Co-workers carried positive attitudes and made the shifts more enjoyable. Hardest part of the job was adjusting to standing up for long periods of time. However the most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that you were going into a workplace where you could have fun while doing work."
good,"Days were 10-12 hours long, which typically only meant a four day work week, but some weekends were required for special events. We had a great Store Manager and a great management team. My employees were wonderful and always willing to learn and step up to the plate to help. I learned a great deal about multi-tasking there, as I was always doing quite a few a things at once, talking to an author who had walked in, placing an order, giving a quote over the phone, while planning multiple in store events at the same time with various groups and organizations. All this while being flagged down to help customers find books and help the cashiers with the neverending line of customers at checkout. It seemed there was never was enough time in the day. The most enjoyable part of the day was in the evening when I was ringing up the sales I had brought in from the previous hard days' work. I loved watching the numbers rack up and seeing that the store was going to make our numbers for that day."
good,Not a terribly bad place to work considering the nature of the job. Atmosphere is quiet and it's fun working with books. Co-workers were pleasant and cooperative. Hardest part of the job was the boredom and the constant micro-management you had to endure.
good,A typical day at work could be fun. I just love all the customer that come in... I learn alot about communication skill the management to much didnt care. I never work for a company before when the managment dont care... the hardest part of the job was dealing with the management.. the most enjoyable part was my co-worker know matter what was going on we always had each other back and always got the job done we was the number one cafe in the mid west for 6 years in the roll
good,"Very willing to educate on the ins & outs of the store. Focus on the needs of the employees as well as the customers. Friendly atmosphere. Always looking to hire part-time people, with possibilities of advancement."
good,Until the last two years this company was wonderful to work for. Due to the change in managment and the economy negative changes occured. Before that time I would only sing praises for B&N.
good,"Organize all of the ordered books, deal with customers"
good,"I was in a very busy store and we would have events all the time. Things could get hectic, especially when not properly staffed. It was fun though because the people were nice. Discounts in store and cafe. Management was pretty nice. Pay could have been a little better."
good,"The manager who hired me only told me that I would work part-time but then 3 months later they told me I was a seasonal employee and terminated me. When I worked there I wasn't properly trained and they would move me to departments I was familiar with. And part of the reason I was fired was because I didn't know how to do some things (due to lack of training). Basically, I was set up for failure."
good,"I worked at B&N for almost 4 years. In the beginning it was an awesome place to work, I loved it, even though it was going to be just a college job. I primarily worked in the cafe (Iwas cross trained elsewhere though) and I should note that the cafe and bookseller are two totally different worlds. I LOVED the cafe. I loved my managers, I am still friendly with them to this day. Super respectful, happy, let you know you’re doinng great when you deserve it. Tips were good. We had awesome regulars. Outside of cafe management though, like ASM and SM and corporate, are totally awful. Miserable, overworked, arrogant people. March around looking for anything to beliddle someone, even if it’s not their place. They pawn off ridiculous impossible projects on other people, and scheduling was a mess. A lot of the time cash wrap would only be one person, even during holiday season! No one scheduled in the music department. No one in the kids department. I saw it a lot. Again...the cafe has their own scheduling and projects, so it was different for me, but it was still super noticeable just being there. And towards the end, they would pull me from the cafe to work in other departments, wearing an apron and all. They would do anything to show dominance and that was tough. If you get a choice, I highly recommend the cafe! If you like barista/server life. Otherwise stay away!"
good,Work can be frustrating because of customers but the coworkers you meet make it all worth it. The culture of barnes and noble is wonderful. You make life long friends there. Mangers can be a little over bearing at times but its all thanks to corporate.
good,"Book retail is like none other.  There is nothing more satisfying than connecting people with books.  Barnes & Noble provides excellent opportunities to learn various aspects of the book trade in a fast-paced, often fun environment."
good,"Worked there part time for a year and half, before there was a job opening as a head cashier and I was immediately offered the job without a interview because of my work performance.. after a few months the company (not my branch but corporate) started making multiple changes and fired nearly half the company across the USA running people who've been full time for 15+ years out of jobs on one blind Monday morning, now nearly everyone has quit due to poor corporate management"
good,It was a great job for my first time working however the pay was very low. We did not get free meals during shifts and we could not take food after closing even if they were to get tossed.
good,"B&N was a fun place to work at. Everybody was friendly and helpful, though there were some differences. It was enjoyable working with customers and having their needs meet. Only wish it was not so profit driven but that is expected for any for profit company."
good,"Overall, working at Barnes and Noble isn't bad, I just isn't for me. I realized that I am better at working in small companies rather thank big ones. Although, you get pretty nice discounts, Including 10% everything and 30% in the cafe."
good,Th work environment is mostly relaxed and its highly encouraged to learn about the product they're selling. There is lifting involved but the reward is being able to see what new books are coming into the store.
good,"Organizing and systematizing store."
good,Working for Geneva Barnes and Noble will give you a well rounded day. Between customers and tasked given by management.  The Management team is well rounded in style and temperament.
good,"A great place to be if you like books. However, you are often working alone in the cafe, but back up is available. Lots of things to remember pertaining to baking pastries and making coffee."
good,"very laid back and easy  going, not very demanding, but there is busy work. Mostly shelving books in proper order and helping customers with their questions."
good,"A typical day at work would involve me talking with my Manager on Duty (MOD) about the day, if there were any tasks I needed to accomplish or if I was scheduled for customer service. We would discuss various role specific metrics and how I would plan to meet them. Then I'd be left to on my own to either accomplish my tasks or help customers as scheduled. "
good,"If you love reading book and working with people its a great place to work. Fun people, relaxed work environment. A good place to go if you need recommendations for books to read."
good,"Hired during the holidays, extremely difficult to become fully trained but got used to it over a few weeks, serves its purpose of a part-time job yet continue to struggle with a few tasks as I haven't been trained 100 %"
good,"Barnes & Noble is a relaxing, friendly place to work.  The employees tend to be readers who take a serious interest in sharing their hobbies with customers.  However, the pay is often barely minimum wage, even for supervisors and managers.  The impression corporate gives is that working in a book store should be recompense enough."
good,"I love my job because of my coworkers and my regular customers. It is a fast paced environment, so I always need to be on my toes. I have to think quickly. The hardest part of the job is not getting enough hours. The managers know how to do their job and they do it well. My coworkers are the most enjoyable part of the job. They are always encouraging me and they make my job fun."
good,I would help customers with their books by searching their text and I believe I would organize the books and other materials that  needed to be put in the shelf .
good,"I started working here because I loved the feel of books, the excitement of telling people of the last book I've read and helping them find the happiness in books I feel, however, I worked the floor less times then I have fingers on one hand. they continued to put me in the cafe. I liked the distraction, but it was not my purpose for wanting to work in the industry at all."
good,"My current position is underpaid and overworked. I moved up from a barista, to a cafe lead, to cafe manager, to district cafe training manager within 5 years. All you need to to be hard working, on time, a fantastically friendly salesperson, and willing to sacrifice a bit of your sanity to micro management."
good,"The corporate decisions sometimes completely misdirect from the overall goal of personalized customer service. Basically, they keep shooting themselves in the foot. They think that Amazon is their competitor, but really it is the newfound burgeoning of independent bookstore popping up in many urban locations that provide local flavor and a love of books and discussions and fun events."
good,"It's a good place to build a foundation of customer service skills and will add a variety of resume material. Sadly, the management team isn't too concerned with you being taken care of. The people themselves are fantastic; it's like an extended family that you would want to spend holidays with. When it comes to your advancement, be prepared to be waiting for quite a while. The full-time positions will become available is if someone leaves or gets promoted. Overall, I like having worked here but I'd recommend getting out within a couple of years for something better."
good,"- It was fast-paced"
good,"Barnes and Noble café can be really crowded at times and can be a fast paced environment. the hardest part of the job is that customer might not be so nice, But the most enjoyable part is the relationships you build with your co-workers."
good,"I enjoy the company, enjoy the work. Retail hours are hard to create a work life balance"
good,"cashier, cashier supervisor inventory, inquiries events, and focuses."
good,Constantly on your feet. Very organized and students were very friendly.
good,Great place to work for book lovers but not something build a family with.
good,I recieved on the job training in the digital area. I have learned how to use my voice help people get what they need.
good,"I spent most of the early part of my employment in the shipping area.  I would organize/stock/ship out product swiftly, much to my supervisor's delight.  However, employees in the Cafe were quitting left and right.  Since I had food experience, I had to leave the zen tranquility of the back room to the fast paced madness of a book store coffee shop.  The experience taught me how to make various espresso and coffee drinks though, so it wasn't all bad."
good,The management actually cares both about customer furfillment and employee happiness which is hard to come by. They also give you plenty space to do your job.
good,"Most of the staff is very friendly and schedules are very flexible for working around school and other commitments. Pay is relatively low and health benefits are useless, but it's an enjoyable work atmosphere."
good,"I was never given the tools to complete my job. My store manager was as frustrated as I was and tried to help me, but the district manager was useless. The infrastructure to support my position was not in place making it next to impossible to properly do my job. Other CBDMs were consistently threatened with losing their jobs if their numbers weren't where they needed to be."
good,The culture at work is great and it is a very open working environment. Everyone got along and were able to be productive together. There is severe understaffing which can make carrying out the work load difficult. It is still a good place to work just not a permanent home.
good,"This was one of my most favorite part time jobs. I enjoyed the work and my co-workers were great to work with. The woman that trained me was super nice and patient, and made sure I was doing ok even when she wasn't working. Would recommend to anyone looking for a stimulating part time position."
good,"Very diversified staff and cultures. A very quick-paced atmoshere and standing for long hours. The hardest part of the job is lack of hours for proper training. The most enjoyable part of my day is getting to know all of our regular customers by name and making new customers feel welcomed to become a regular. becoming a cafe manager inside a bookstore gives me the opportunity to cross train as a merchandising manager to zone, shelf, and set up displays."
good,Nice set hours & good people to work with.  Pushing of the membership cards @ $25/yr was a daily speech.  No vacations or time off during Thanksgiving to Christmas season.
good,"I love books and I love working at this store but unfortunately it was not all I was expecting. The staff is great, very kind and friendly. But provided with low work hours, working only 2-3 days a week. They continue to hire more people but provide few hours for people that are already employed. Very focused on selling! must be able to sell to make any kind of progress in that place. Honestly this place is a hit or miss."
good,"Barnes and Noble was a great company to work for that showed appreciation for their employees. "
good,"There is always something to do, can be very fun if you are creative. This company is very good with promoting employees"
good,I learning some responsabilities in this work old time i productivity il like to work with every people
good,"Store managers are very easy to get along with and very approachable, however at the district level they seem to have a rather large disconnect with day-to-day store operations, leading to much frustration with them. One of the worst parts of the job is that corporate only sees ONE aspect of your performance, selling store memberships, and judges your eligibility for raises/promotions/transfers on that alone, regardless of your performance in other areas (like actual customer service). They also do not like to actually give benefits, as I discovered after working there for over a year only to find out I was considered ineligible due to being considered a temporary hire for the first few months (which I was not informed of), then having the system default all the employees at my store to a system setting of 15 hours per week despite having actually worked about twice that on average. The pay is far too low to actually live on as well. I have coworkers in their late twenties who still live with their parents (as do I) despite being engaged because they simply cannot afford to save up and/or move out, even after several years with the company. I have become much more outgoing as a result of this job, and I greatly enjoy the satisfaction of being able to help customers find what they are looking for, but in the end I find it very hard to recommend this company to others as an employer."
good,"When my shift starts its steady and non-stop for the first hour. The transactions that take place are pretty short, less than a minute, so you don't get to be too personable with the customers. Here I learned a lot about food safety containing certain packaged foods. Refrigerated food can't be kept on the shelf longer than a full week and anything thats cooked and is hot has to be thrown away within four hours if not purchased. The management is pretty easy going and let the employees work independently. My co-workers are easy to get along with and have a variety of personalities that make them fun and unique. The hardest part of the job is restocking for the next day because of the location of the storage room and the small cambros we use for restocking, it takes up a long part of the shift. The most enjoyable part of the job is coming into contact with the customers because they are the students of the university and are so diverse."
good,"An excellent workplace, combining good management, with an inviting atmosphere. Employees can expect a good benefits package, and a low-stress working environment. On the downside, the pay isn't great, and hours tend to be spread thin amongst the company's many employees."
good,"If you are a reader, it's paradise. If you need to make money, look elsewhere. Everyone starts at mini wage and caps out at $12/hr unless you move into mgmt. No one but mgt gets 40hrs, so no benefits."
good,"You start your day going over your schedule with the Manager on Duty. You then don a headset and report to your assigned location (sometimes roaming if assigned to sell). If placed in the Cafe you will learn how to prepare Starbucks beverages and several types of pastries.  There is a very welcoming environment from all the booksellers, and plenty of time to socialize. The hardest part of the Cafe is that they are often understaffed and the staff is overworked because of it. The best part of the job is the management in Cafe and the relationships formed with co-workers"
good,They had a nice community of people working there. I was in the Cafe part serving Starbucks products to customers and fellow employees. fast paced but easy to get the hang of.
good,"Great people to work with. And a fun environment. Every day was new and different. The management was great and I never intended to leave. Sorry thing is they abolished my job, so I didn't have a choice. The hardest part of this job was sometimes the customers. And lots of times they were the best."
good,It was busy when school started but it became much slower as the school year progressed and a lot of my hours were cut along with my co-workers. There was not much work to do after that time was done.
good,"Interesting, fun and active place to work. Really enjoyed my time there. Employees that work there, really want to work and help customers and motivate each other."
good,"After 9 years of dedicated service, my position was eliminated abruptly. I lost my livelihood in an instant, along with many others in the company. Management works harder than they are compensated. The people who work there are great. Corporate is the issue. Barnes and Noble is no longer the wonderful company to work for as it was nearly a decade ago."
good,I worked at the Santa Fe College bookstore. It was a great experience where i met many people and got acquainted with the college. I tried to receive permanent placement for a job position but i was not offered one despite working hard.
good,Working for the Barnes and Noble company was an overall good expericence and provided me with a decent amount of compensation for my time working the as a College student.
good,"The management was great at the location that I worked at. It was awesome to get discounts on coffee drinks but the pay is not that great. The pay is enough for gas, food, and leisure fun- not enough for rent."
good,"As a bookseller, there's multiple duties that are given. Everyday is different and constantly changing. I work Customer Service, cashier, gift wrap, shelving and the music department on a weekly basis. Management is always available and assisting when needed. They're very much involved with the customers and the employees on duty. My co workers are team players and hard workers. The hardest part of my job is dealing with difficult customers. The most enjoyable part of my job is the experience working with great people and assisting the customers."
good,"It was great place to work at, I was offering my best services to the costumers."
good,This was a great place to work. It smelled like coffee and books. The customers were as varied as the products that we sold. Our location was great at hiring passionate and friendly people that were just the right level of strange. It was a job that required plenty of physical work along with a strong knowledge of the products that we sold.
good,"Learned about many books, and helped customers make purchases of books they were requesting. Had the ability to learn more about different authors."
good,"I work at the Flagship store located at Union Square. They are very understanding and flexible with schedules but the pay is horrid. They start off $8.50 hourly and a 25 cent raise every 6 months to a year. People ask dumb questions all the time like ""What floor am I on? Is the bathroom up here?"" Homeless people sleep in the event space. I enjoy the coworkers. Very down to earth. Only work here good discounts or if you're trying to go corporate."
good,Constant movement. Having the ability to multitask on a numerous amount of levels. Being on point focused consistent also hardworking with lots of energy. Having patience. Being very helpful understanding. Listening to the college students and giving them what they came their for. Staying focused also on task.
good,-help students located and purchase textbooks for semester length courses
good,I outlasted 10 managers over that time. Did everything other than the cafe and receiving the books in.
good,"Even though I was hired as a part time worker, they had me working hours of a full time employee and was not paid for my overtime hours. I did have nice relationships with colleagues which made it bearable."
good,Shortest job ever. No advancement really. Wish I could have worked more.
good,"Job was good until management/Corporate started pushing too hard for sales, the job wasn't what it used to be a year ago. Management started cherry picking and gave citations for any mistakes that undesirable workers did so they would get fed up and leave the company."
good,Ok place to work.  Busy. Co workers are fine.  Business brisk.  Mall nice. Restaurants nice.
good,"This was a career I was sad to say I was unhappy to work at. If you not making sales they push you out no chances, or help they just expect you to do it."
good,"The store manager is a bit of a problem to work with, but all other employees are fantastic to work with. Working in the cafe, the hardest thing to do is to make sure you get all the customers satisfied with in a short amount of time while still being the best customer service representative you can be."
good,"Barnes and Noble was a dream job, but then there was a management change and the level of turnover was astounding. This particular store lost almost 50 employees in less than a year, including core members of management who were instrumental in making the store a warm, welcoming place. At first, B&N was the ideal place to work, full of passionate, enthusiastic employees who connected well with repeat customers, had personal rapports built, and who were excited about working there. After the changes in late 2014, however, the store lost all charm and all important core members of management and core employees, and it was no longer a fun, engaging place to work."
good,"Slowest Barnes and Noble in existence. No fun events happen to bring people in and if they did, nobody would know about them. Hardest part about the job is actually trying to find something to do because there literally isn't anything."
good,"My review of this job would have to be a medium between good and bad because i liked the easy work and the hours that were ""Eligible"" but i was never put on a schedule i liked to work and they were not very cooperative about more hours or what work, being that im a good employee i found myself doing most of the work of even some of my team members job, in which i do not complain because i job is a job and if need be done then i will do it, but overtime i expect a little bit of respect for such actions and in return more hours or such. but nothing was ever recognized at this employer."
good,". A typical day at work is a customer asking if we have a certain book in stock and where it would be."
good,"good workers, decent training, not much business, not many working hours"
good,Management is unapproachable. No one seems to enjoy working there anymore and people are looking for other employment options.
good,"The upper management was the biggest reason why I left. Overall, it was pretty chill, great paid and even part-time people can get sick time, and after six months paid time off."
good,"I truly enjoyed working at Barnes &  Noble.  Unfortunately, the hours were very minimal at times.  Most of the year I only got about four and a half to eight hours of work a week.  The exception was holidays. I started at Christmas time as a seasonal worker and was not trained very well.  So there was a lot of on-the-job learning.  That was a bit stressful.  I also felt the  management  was too busy to really take time to really work with me if I had work questions.  even though this was a retail job, the customers were great."
good,I love everyone I work with and the management is pretty nice. Just not too much room for advancement and it is extremity short staffed. The pay for the cafe is rather low considering I feel as if I’m doing the job of 5 people. Great job while you’re in school/figuring out what you want to do!
good,I took this as a part-time job as I worked full time for five years. I love the books but I didn't work enough hours to be considered for advancement. The more hours you put in the higher up you go. It's like any other retail job. Not a lot of flexibility for hours.
good,Everyone was really kind but you had to make sure you reached your membership sales in order to be liked and kept. Was given minimal hours and was never trained anywhere else besides cash wrap.
good,"I actually enjoyed working at Barnes & Noble. It was tough at times, but that is how it can be in retail. I am even still friends with a lot of the people I used to work with there, both from general staff and from management."
good,"For the most part being a bookseller is interesting and challenging, Most days are filled with multitasking and no two shifts are ever the same. Customer service is at the core of the job but personal growth is possible with the resources available. Individual achievement is driven by the individual not management. As with most corporate retail jobs it always comes down to numbers and membership sales are the key to keeping hours and advancing,"
good,at the time management was terrible they didn't take in consideration that we had school to deal with along with our studies.
good,"Two rounds of interview - preliminary with one manager and then the second, final interview with two others. Relatively simple, asked what made me apply for the job, if I'm a customer,  and what my schedule would be like."
good,"Everyday at B&N varies in stress level, but there's usually something for anyone. If you want to be staying busy the entire time, there's always something to do, but if you'd rather take it a bit easy, customers love an engaged experience. Handling books is easy, and once you get a feel for the general areas of the store, you can lead someone to whatever they're looking for without much issue. Co-workers and managers are always willing to help, and reliable breaks help keep you going through even the toughest of days."
good,"I loved my discount, but the job is not ideal. Hours vary (both the amount and when you're scheduled.). I worked at two different locations in two different states and both were not the greatest experience. Mainly because of management. They expect a lot, but don't appreciate what's done. They also do a very poor job at communicating what's needed and you find yourself ""failing"" when you were never directed on the specifics. My coworkers were fantastic though, and we made it a fun environment. I also VERY much love books and coffee, so that part was enjoyable."
good,Was not a bad place to work will going to school. Added bonus of getting discounts on books for college which as you know can be pretty expensive. I would recommend working here to others
good,A typical day at work was picking and wrapping books for online orders. The most enjoyable part of the job was all the employees worked together as a family.
good,its a good place for a college student to work. the atmosphere is quick paced and very demanding. the managers change often. not many breaks are offered.
good,"The pressure to sell memberships is insane and without any form of incentive. Coworkers are usually really nice and good friendships have been formed and customers are typically pretty pleasant as well. However, they just had a nationwide sweep of layoffs and my store alone lost four of our best employees. Since the managers weren’t prepared for it, this week was a madhouse. Part time has good hours at the moment but full timers are left worrying about job security. Many of us are currently looking for work elsewhere. Ultimately, I think it’s a bit risky to work there at the moment with the decrease we’ve had in sales, who knows whether the stores will even stay open for much longer."
good,"My experience at this company was positive, and I enjoyed the fast-paced retail and cafe environment of the location. I had great experiences with the customers and became friends with my coworkers. I was able to continue my skills as a barista while I was attending a local college."
good,"Not really any room for advancement unless you had been working with the company for years."
good,"I was only a cashier, and you literally had to sit at the front and never leave. it just got to a point where i was constantly bored and unstimulated."
good,"A typical work day would include organizing books and other products on the store floor, providing great customer services, and working as a cashier. Breaks do not feel long enough and the hardest part of the job would be the long period of time that you have to stand before taking a break."
good,"working in the cafe is alright, wages could be higher. Could be a more balanced work environment. Good location and hours. Very customer service oriented."
good,"basically a customer service position which requires you to help customers find books and the occasional station at the cash register"
good,"While the pay in this company, on the retail side, leaves much to be desired the staff and job experience you encounter while working here are invaluable."
good,"Breaks are always received, but long hours and not very consistent in scheduling. The people have great hearts and are friendly."
good,"Management cared more for profit than promoting literacy. Dress code required.Poor salary, little benefits. Co-workers all College degree holding booksellers. Management poor and envious of Literary and Historical knowledge"
good,"Working here gave me both good and bad experiences, many of the coworkers as well as the customer base were wonderful, but the management left much to be desired. There were a few of the managers that truly cared for their employees, but the head management let a lot of policies slide under the table, as well as let other managers get away with slacking. The best part of this job was definitely the coworkers."
good,A good slow pace for a customer service based job. Terrible pay and no raises or promotions.
good,"Barnes and Nobles was an exciting place to work  at, the hours were great and the staff was amazing. the only issue was there was no room for promotion or advancement."
good,"the experience was great, I was hired for a seasonall position I was a cashier also i stacked the books. I love helping customers and this experience help me showcase my skills."
good,I would go in to stock shelves with books. I would wait for students to come in and be the first ones to help them. I have learned that there is order in every way of life. I learned that by helping students with books in a certain order would decrease the time of searching and would make the customer happy by moving quick.
good,"I loved my job here, truly, however, the hours are highly variable to what the ""system"" thinks you should get. Sometimes you'd get very few, and your bank account would be left high and dry, and sometimes you'd get so much that you'd find it difficult to find a moment of free time between this and other jobs/school/life. Overall love the coworkers and met a lot of interesting people."
good,"Working here was so fun, but very busy. The expectation of excellence isn't enough on most days. However, you would get recognized for doing your best. Christmas time was the best time. You would have a heavy load of things to do, and be exhausted by the end of your shift. However, it is the only time during the year you get the extra people to help support the load. Working in the cafe, there is normally 2 to 3 people working a shift. During Christmas, 5 or more. Which that should be the normal. Each night is touch and go. Some days you could have a total of 5 customers and other days, 65 customers. You can never determine when you will be busy. However, you always have enough staff when you don't need it and never enough when you do. It makes for over worked, underpaid, exhaustion that leaves people not showing up for their shift, or quitting with no warning. The discount is very nice at B&N and you can do almost all your Christmas shopping for cheap. I would work there again, but only part time. You get paid weekly, and it is very easy to blow your paycheck in the store. Don't get sucked down the rabbit hole! The store manager there now used to be the manager at the Cafe and she is always super helpful. The store manager before her was also amazing and started his B&N journey in the cafe. He helped a lot as well. However, the manager I had in the Cafe at the time, relied a lot of her manager duties on the rest of us. It made the duties we already have slack and made it harder to finish her projects and ours. She was an amazing, positive, fun person to always be around. As"
good,"Barnes & Noble Booksellers is definitely in the upper echelon of retail jobs. That said, its still retail. Hours are flexible but inconsistent, pay is far below a livable wage, handling retail customers is rarely if ever anything but taxing, health benefits are bare-minimum or non-existent."
good,"Management at my store is mediocre. But there is basically no way to move up unless you become a manager which is unlikely considering all of them have worked there for a very long time and don't plan to quit. The environment is relatively fast paced and high energy. I only recommend working for Barnes and Noble if you enjoy the environment and books. A  LOT. Otherwise, the pay is not worth it. The benefits are better if you're a full-time employee which there are not many of considering they got rid of almost all of those positions. Overall, Its okay."
good,"I love working at Barnes and Noble. Overall it is a great experience, but some of the management wasn't very considerate about time availability because of how understaffed we were. I was given too many hours and even when I asked for less it slightly changed and then again when back to how it was before. The work culture was mostly healthy but it was very difficult to handle while also going to college."
good,"At the beginning of the semester it stayed very busy, constantly. As the semester advanced it grew slow and boring because many people had already gotten their textbooks. They are wonderful people to work with and productivity is key. Some managers are nicer than others."
good,Productive and fun workplace. Pay is not suitable . Average Managers  Who Don't Think Outside the Box. But Overall Barnes and Noble is fun and interesting place to work
good,For somebody who loves books and does not want to make a career out of a Barnes & Noble than this place is perfect for you.Great customer service experience although slightly disorganized and fluctuating management at the moment.
good,"Working at this company has been a great experience, the problem that I endured was the lack of pay. There is no room for growth in this company. If you are a college student then yes, good first job."
good,"When you opened, you had to make sure everything is clean and organized, and make new pastries for the day, learned about all the new and upcoming drinks. the coworker s and the Starbucks manager was super kind and helpful."
good,"I enjoyed working at Barnes & Noble overall. However, it was frustrating that the pay was so low and there was no benefit to getting memberships for the store. Even if you were a top seller, it did not amount to anything akin to a raise which wouldn't happen until a year after you worked there (it would be minimal even with that). The management were willing to assist employees and support them with difficult customers. Behind the scenes, it was hard to feel like employees really wanted to befriend one another although this is likely because the employees are spread thinly throughout the store so socializing can only happen on breaks - and you're generally the only one on break at a time."
good,I got very few hours and was not paid very much. At the time my father became ill and passed away. They were very understanding at the time but right after the holidays they laid me of without warning. I asked for the schulde for the next week and they said they would call me ant let me know the hours and just never called. It may have just been the management at the store that I worked for. I may never know but it made me very inscure in my job security.
good,"was an enjoyable place to work until the district manager change.  when you weren't on his favorite list, you were forced out.  prior to that, it was enjoyable selling product that you love."
good,"Only worked part time, but it is a very relaxed environment. Gained a lot of knowledge about literature. Not very many opportunities for growth or moving up in company."
good,A competitve wage makes it much easier to put all your focus on the task at hand instead of worrying about how many hours you will need to pay your bills. at the time i made almost half of what a starbucks barista made even though I had to make all the same drinks and even more food than starbucks
good,A typical day could be both relaxing and stressful.  I have learned the importance of being able to have an open mind about everything and to think on a global level.  Erring on the side of the customer is appreciated by most
good,great place to work for college students. great benefits and great discounts on books. we didnt work many hours because they hired a lot of college students.
good,"Barnes & Noble is a nice company to work for, probably one of the nicest. However if you are looking for advancement within the company it could be hard to come by"
good,"This was a very productive job.  You learn a lot i everything you do.  On a typical day, you interact the most with students.  The store is usually crowded."
good,B&N is a wonderful place to work. There is very transparent communication at all levels of the organization. It is hard to move up because of scarcity of jobs. Most people in management don't leave.
good,"A great place to work for book lovers, and a great community of people. Unfortunately oftentimes there is not a lot to do in the day, and management can be pushy."
good,"Barnes and Noble is a very good place to start off your work experience if you have none. You get hands-on training along side coworkers who are always there to help.  The managers also will look out for you and make sure you're doing a good job.  The environment of the job is very open and welcoming and it's easy to slip into a good routine there."
good,"Working there gave me a chance to experience having a job and make my own money. In addition, I also acquired new skills in retail and an understanding of how retail is done. I also had a chance to provide a service to students seeking an education on campus."
good,"Your team becomes a second family, but the unprofessional environment can be both a negative and a positive. Working retail in general can be exhausting and without the right management team this job could be stressful."
good,"Fun store to work for. Sometimes, when things got hectic, tempers would flare but incidents were easily resolved with apologies. Sometimes co-workers would be confused as we were told the way we were trained was incorrect but then never trained the correct way."
good,Great place to meet wonderful people. Awesome interactions with customers who are possibly wanting to further education and learn a little more about the world and the people in it.
good,"I loved coming into work.  I loved the people.  I loved the books. I loved the people I worked with. I worked on the floor, behind the register, at the help desk, as a shelver, and as a barista."
good,great bookstore location to get solid food or drink choices. Pretty standard operation with not much happening out of the ordinary clients.
good,Store Manager was incompetent and impersonal. DM did not get involved in store issues.....................................................
good,"Anyone who loves to read knows about Barnes and Noble. the combination of a library and a social hangout spot for college students and nannies. When we would open up the store, there would be people waiting line at 8:00 A.M waiting to get inside. I enjoyed helping customers find new books they didn't know existed yet. Just by meeting them one time, I can tell what they would be inclined to read and the next week, they would tell me how much they enjoyed the book i referred them to and if i could recommend another."
good,enjoyed working environment and fellow employees. Some heavy lifting required. reduced staff to management only due to reduced sales.
good,"Barnes and Noble taught me a lot as far a being a leader, being a great sales person to customers, and learning more about businesses from a managers perspective. There I was a cashier, bookseller, sales associate, and a food preparer. On a typical day: I would count my drawer, turn on lights, make sure the floor was clean and arranged neatly, assisted customers with finding certain books and ordered books for them if we did not have the book they desired, fulfilled online orders of books or apparel, marked down prices, restocked shelves, restocked the floor with new or old apparel, arranged books on shelves alphabetically, and janitorial work. At the end of the day I locked the doors, and made sure the store was clean for opening. Management was great and by most workers being college students, they were very understanding and worked around our schedule. All of my co-workers were nice and easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job was when I first started because they did not train me and most of the time I had to figure things out on my own, which is not a bad thing. I'm a quick learner so I caught on to things pretty quick. The most enjoyable time of the job is rush because thats the busiest time of the season and it's pressuring but the we all worked well as a team that we got things done effectively."
good,"What I've learned most importantly while working for Barnes & Noble was how to handle customers or customer care. I also learned how to handle large volumes customers at once. My co-workers were all super stars that's all I can say. When times were tough they always try to cheer you up and put a smile on your face or ask you if you were tired, so that they can cover for you in order for you to go out for a five minute water-break. The best part of the job, I would say was the end of the work day not because work ended there was always work but you got to relax, and clean the store and chit chat with your co-workers. You got to know them as real human beings, even the management were not all that bad. As long as you did your job, worked hard, and occasionally went above and beyond everyone was almost like friends in the end of the day."
good,Overall I think it would be better if the could get more hours so that we can afford to receive benefits.
good,They hire temporary workers at the beginning of the semester for three weeks and fires 90%. there is not a single thing that is hard. Only thing hard to get is the position for the job.
good,well for students because you can get discounts on books and work around school schedule.
good,"I was hired fort he back to school rush, it was a temp job but my overall experience was good. I just wish the pay was a little better."
good,"If the managers don't like you, you're in for a tougher time. Stay out of drama and keep yourself busy. Manager and floor worker turn over rate is very high, yet the managers don't communicate well with each other (had 4- 5 of them at once). Lots of opportunities for training though. Favoritism is very present."
good,Being a bookseller can be interesting and look good on a job application. Being a good salesman is important. The daily tasks are very easy but you must enjoy people because this is customer service. You get a discount on books. Management was encouraging for the most part. Be knowledgeable and be friendly doing this kind of work. Don't be afraid to ask questions.
good,"Barnes and Noble is a fun place to work, however, most of the time people call in and you end up having to work more hours than you would like. And if you happen to call in because of an emergency/illness they’ll want to know every detail about it to determine whether or not you called in for a valid reason. Great managers though. Just wish the pay was better and jobs were secured."
good,"I folded more clothes than helped customers, something I really wasn't expecting when I applied for the role. But it worked for what I needed it for and helped with my college expenses."
good,"I loved my crew and their passion for books. Working with the schools and encouraging reading in my community was the best part of the job. My manager was difficult to work with, and upper management struggled with competition from Amazon and Kindle. Job security became questionable, and there was no room for advancement as they were closing stores and not opening them. It was the best job I ever had, but I had to move on."
good,"It depends which area of the store you work in, but the cafe is very fast paced and stressful. You also don’t get much help from others if there’s a rush of people."
good,I worked as a Bookseller for the month of December in 2009 as holiday help.  I enjoyed learning about how to help customers with their purchases and various forms of payment.
good,"I had worked both cashiering and stocking. I enjoyed stocking more as it was earlier morning, and less stress. Cashiering entailed selling memberships, and cleaning while not busy."
good,"If you love books it's a great place to work and talk about books all day long.  If you're looking for a career to get ahead, keep looking.  While B&N has changed into a more sales focused organization than previously just an upscale library - it's still an ideal place for book lovers to work."
good,Its a great first job. It is not a job for anyone that is responsible for bills. Its an exciting job but the pay is poor. Its fun learning how to make the different drinks.
good,"Simple design for the workplace.  If you work here, you are a retail associate, plus whatever your main job is.  If you're seasonal retail, that means you're a gopher who also is expected to help customers when they interrupt you.  If you're seasonal stock, that means you're supposed to deliver books to their proper places (Roughly) on the shelf and help customers when they interrupt you.  They have secret shoppers showing up every month which strictly enforces a very specific personality for their workers.  Their management is under constant stress to meet rather specific quotas which they only advertise to the day shift, and can effect whether people remain hired or are terminated."
good,Fun place to work if you are a student and only need a few hours a week. They won't hire anyone but managers full time and they don't offer any health benefits just discounts.
good,"I loved working at BN, the discount was great and the employees were wonderful. However, the management, even though I was one of them, was terrible, stressful, and unfair."
good,-Great starter job for college students! Management works well with your schedule and you learn great people skills with a diverse group of people!!!!
good,"I believe that the job itself is easy, if you are capable of being quick on your feet, friendly to customers, and efficient with tasks. However, the pay for part-time is only minimum wage and the opportunities to increase the pay are very low and only once a year. However, employees do receive a 30% discount."
good,"I learned some skills or improved my skills such as I need to answer phone call. Every day had  a lot of phone calls. Also, I needed to comunicate to the customers to help them finding somethings such as textbook or supplies. I used a TA program to search textbook for customers what campus they can find the textbooks."
good,"On a typical busy day, we usually have  a lot of customers come in to purchase their books and so it is essential that you be quick in finding books and other things they or even help multiple customers to help to their satisfaction."
good,"I absolutely loved this job. In fact, I would happily work there again if given fair pay. You are not limited to a single department. Moving up in the company is not easy. For some reason my particular store always hired from outside. The reason I left was because I was denied two separate management positions that I was more than qualified for."
good,I loved working with the other booksellers and managers. I do not like the pressure of having to sell memberships. I loved helping parents find books for their kids.
good,"Productive, nice place t work for. Managers are nice and easy going."
good,"Work can change depending on what department you're in. The managers in general are nice and understanding if something comes up. At times, dealing with customers that really tried my patience was difficult (college students, school tours, and college tours). Also, game days are almost complete madness but the managers are great at organizing the workers."
good,It was a fun and fast pace environment during rush week. The leadership was great because they new their products and where willing to teach you everything they knew.
good,"Secure, very little room for advancement if any. Management focuses on the negatives heavily while down playing success, which is fine considering they are driving for success, however a little celebration is nice at times"
good,"wish they could have paid me enough to stay.  management was awesome, but they gave me no livable hours, even after nearly five years.  Discounts were nice, but i cant pay my bills or feed my children with ten bucks and hours and less than 30 hours a week."
good,"Decent work environment, however, temporary positions are hard to maintain after the holiday season. Seeking opportunities with more permanency and compensation."
good,"A typical day is extremely varied and includes shelving, answering phones and helping customers,  merchandising,  cashiering, and lots of constant re-shelving.  I learned how to listen  and match customer needs with our product,  also customers taught me much interesting information.  The managers are overall very dedicated and hard-working,  easy to approach. Co-workers are extremely diverse well-mannered,  educated, hard-working,  and co-operative, well informed.  The hardest part of the job is not having a set schedule and huge swings in shift hours-work can start at 7am one day and another day start at 5pm ending at 1am.  Also you are on your feet all day on the floor and can walk miles during a shift back and forth to find products. The most enjoyable part is meeting high quality customer looking for culturally relevant products. i also enjoyed being active and not at a desk."
good,"My store had unprofessional drama in relation to the cafe manager position.  This made working with certain employees along with the manager very unpleasant.  The cafe employees were very separated from the book floor employees, and we were often left out of team meetings."
good,"B&N is a fun place to work and you get to meet a lot of interesting people. However, if you are looking to advance then this is not the correct place to do so. Depending on each store, higher management can either empower you to succeed or in other cases it can throw up a road block and have you coast along with promises of advancement and training that never come."
good,"As someone with a chronic illness and a very sick parent, I had trouble doing my job to the satisfaction of my store manager. I explained my situation to her provided multiple notes from doctors that said I was to be allowed to sit and rest when needed and that I shouldn't be bending down and lifting heavy things, both of which were part of my daily job as a cashier."
good,"I enjoy working with Customers at Barnes & Noble. Helping Customers find books, helping children pick out a book to read and the flexible hours are the perks working at Barnes & Noble."
good,The place is alright. The management could use a kick in the pants. They like to get people from outside to take jobs from the internal employees who deserve the promotions way more.
good,"The job itself was fine. People as usual are the problem. Since in this state parents are responsible for procuring their child's school books, there was always a rush and always an angry last minute shopper who will trash you personally for not having the book in stock."
good,"As a sales associate I gained knowledge in cashiering and costumer service. I also received shipping and order knowledge pulling books, packaging them, and sorting them accordingly. I often restocked shelves and displays while also answering and questions costumers had."
good,Its a really fun job in an amazing environment! Taking breaks and lunches here were the best if you loved being around books! If it weren't for the low pay and highly demanding work I would have stayed much longer. One of my favorite work environments though!
good,"I really enjoyed working at bnn, I got hurt and lost my job or I would still be there.  Good managers, adequate break oppurtunities, and steady repetitive work made this the best job I probably ever had."
good,"I've made great friends here and if you are comfortable interacting with customers, enjoy reading, and have good time management skills this is the perfect part time job for you. I never saw myself moving up in the company, but you get a wide variety of experience that can prepare you for a full time job."
good,"Days are pretty much the same day in and out, very little changes. I learned that retail management is tough. There are many moving parts to maintain."
good,Working in the mall and talking to people all day while you fill food orders. If you enjoy talking to people and working behind a counter this is the job for you.
good,"Barnes and Noble is a fantastic company with a lot to offer, but it is only really a good job for a student because there is no advancement opportunities past part time unless you are in a store with a high lead turn over rate, and if that is the case you do not wish to work at that location."
good,"Typically a day at work consisted of walking the floor recommending books and pushing ones we were required to push to customers. Management was helpful, and the culture of the workplace was very relaxed and laid back. The hardest part of the job were the customers, of course, but also the most enjoyable part."
good,"good job for student, calm and relaxed work environment. diverse work, pay good. care about employees. management could be better and more younger employees would be better"
good,"I work for Barnes & Noble College Bookstores, not Barnes & Noble, there is a difference, so anything I would write here would not be pertinent as I have never worked for Barnes & Noble."
good,"I liked it, since I was only hired to work for a month before Christmas I won't pretend I had a normal work experience. If the pay was better I would be trying to get back full time. Pay might be better if you aren't a holiday temp."
good,"I started here as a cashier and worked my way up to management. I would have stayed longer but had a difficult time with the district manager. Was ""too young"" to be promoted higher than I already had been."
good,"Barnes & Noble was the perfect job while I was studying in university. I learned a lot from working there, such as customer service skills, people skills, and meeting new people from all areas and walks of life. However, it was not a place that I desired to work for past graduation since I received my degree in Psychology."
good,Retail job with all of the things that go along with that; low pay and variable work hours with no set schedule. It was also located in the mall. Management was good and had a good workplace culture.
good,not a bad place to work for a college campus book store if your into that. thier isnt much job security unless your in a management role at the technical community college book store... atleast on North Campus as far as i know
good,"balancing customer service, employee training, product display and merchandise sales, while given the flexibility of work schedule. Great opportunity to learn from management team"
good,"About what you'd expect working at a place like Starbucks. However, because it was in a bookstore and stand-alone Starbucks was a block away, there weren't many difficult customers. Coworkers and managers were generally nice and friendly people. For a first job, this was pretty good."
good,"I really enjoyed working at B&N, the management was great, the hours were good and worked around my class schedule. Besides the craziness at the beginning of the semester an the end, it was awesome!"
good,"The job is fun, the majority of the book sellers and cashiers are great but the managers are awful.  They are extremely moody and there is a high turn-over rate all around for the company.  Once inside the company there is little room for advancement usually they hire from outside."
good,"Some days are busier than others. They like to keep you in areas that you succeed in. My managers are very understanding, and the company wide competitions keep everyone on their toes."
good,I enjoyed my time here up to a certain point.  I've worked with some great people & I love the books.  I realized that there really isn't any room to move up.
good,"I love books. I love people. I love people who love books.  I enjoyed working at Barnes and Noble, with the one exception; the floors in both the public and receiving areas were very unforgiving on my feet and knees."
good,"The whole point of it was trying to up-sell but also to help people that are trying to further their education find the best affordable way without feeling as though it would be a burden to pursue academic advancement. I may have been just a book salesman, but it felt nice helping families and fresh out of high school teens trying to make sure they weren't overpaying for a book or to make sure they knew what they needed to be ready for their first semester. I don't know if any of my co-workers felt the same, but it was pretty rewarding to get a thank you and a handshake from teens and mothers. The hardest part was leaving, it was a seasonal temp job, but it was still pretty enjoyable."
good,"Barnes and Noble is a very relaxed and fun place to work while also maintaining efficiency in the sales and marketing of books. Help customers either find a particular book or provide ideas that match the customers desires. Quickly ring up any sales and report back to the floor. Clean and organize the store as it can become quite disorganized over the course of a day. If they need help, make drinks in the coffee shop. At the end of the night,total store safes and tills"
good,"Was a nice place to work and had decent management. The position also came with decent discounts of almost all merchandise. however, the pay was far too low to live off of and raises are low if they happen at all."
good,I enjoyed my years at Barnes & Noble. The work life balance there is amazing as a salaried retail person. The insurance is decent and the 401K match is good. The pay isn't the best but the other items made up for it. There has been a lot of turnover from the top down so it made it difficult to create and maintain relationships with upper management to help move up career wise.
good,"Though I do enjoy this line of work to a degree, it is not of my central interests, so my review will be a bit biased. The job is typical food service work, albeit in a much nicer environment than most places I have worked at before."
good,"On a whole, retail can be challenging, between customer and company demands, but my co-workers in particular, make all of that easier to bare. Unfortunately, a lot is demanded/expected of a bookseller, without much  compensation or gratitude from higher up. And customers can be beyond challenging: they can be demanding; rude; ignorant; and ungrateful. But they can also be: gracious; considerate; and kind. My co-workers and I help each other cope with the meaner customers, and revel in the kindness of other customers."
good,Once the Holiday season was over I was able to get to know my coworkers better and I work with an amazing team. I don't always get along with my coworkers but I respect them and admire their work ethic.
good,"Overall a nice place to work, however the wage and available hours were less than desired and opportunities for promotions were extremely limited."
good,"Manager was ok, but supervisors and other coworkers were super friendly!"
good,"I enjoyed that all of my co-workers were very cooperative with each other. My manager was fantastic, he would let me know if I made a mistake and tell me how to improve it. I learned how to operate a register and how to help students find the correct book(s) for the courses that individual was registered in,"
good,"enjoyed working with customer, assisting in research material, helping college student local books needed for studies."
good,"The workers themselves are very friendly (Most).I worked as a temporary bookseller (cashier) so I didn't get the chance to socialize much expect for with other cashiers.You get great discounts and the schedule are pretty simple.Either opening shift, mid shift or ending.I would say it's a good part time job for the pay, but couldn't see myself working there long term.It was fun while it lasted but that's about it"
good,I liked working here. I got along well with my coworkers and most customers would come in in a good mood. The only issue was the dislike my manager seemed to have for me.
good,"A typical day at work can simply begin with checking out the daily assignment sheet after clocking on, and then speaking with the current manager on duty.  This is to keep everyone well informed and up to date with daily changes, including daily sales goals, membership sales, as well as promotions.  Throughout my shift, I cover breaks within various departments of the store.   The focus of my time is on customer service; helping customers find merchandise, offer recommendations, take phone calls, nook support/troubleshooting.  There are times when I am cashiering, or working in the cafe.  Often a typical day at work may not be the same as the day at work before.  I have experience opening and closing the cafe, preparing and serving food, cleaning, and recovering cafe area.  I have experience with helping supervise and train new booksellers.  The most enjoyable part of the job is working in a bookstore, surrounded by a variety of knowledge, entertainment, etc.  I enjoy helping other people find a good book to read and sharing interests and discussing our learned knowledge.  The hardest part is that it can be messy.  We are a service to the general public and there is constant recovery that must be maintained throughout the shift.  Depending on the time of year, specifically around the holidays, customers, continue to be the priority however, the store may become very dirty and books get pulled and placed in random areas around the store.  Recovery becomes a longer task."
good,"-Create a friendly, casual, helpful experience for customers"
good,I learned how to use a cash register and how to balance out the drawers. Managers were good nice people. I would just deal with costumers all day.
good,"This was wonderful experience. Management was okay, the manager I had was wonderful but there were problems with inconsistency with other management. The most exciting time was the busy hours where everything was fast paced. I would definitely recommend this job for people looking to gain experience."
good,"I learned to alphabetize, organize, and create attractive displays of books. I like learning about new books right when they are published. I also write novels so I am interested in get ideas from other writers."
good,"This was my second Internships and First as a Quality Assurance Intern, We worked and interacted with various seniors leaders and a diversity of personalities. Working here was learning a new experience by the day."
good,"I enjoyed my coworkers and the work environment, while I hoped to have gotten paid more for the area I live in, I still enjoyed working there and the management was good as well."
good,"There was a co worker that kept following me, My co-worker kept taking pictures of me without my permission. My job was very typical at times but it was okay."
good,As long as you can work in a fast-paced job with multiple things needing to be done then it is a great place. Making sure to have a list of things to do for the week really helped out. The management team strives to help things get moving and are very friendly.
good,"Nice place to work at, consistent, good manager staff, great discounts, great environment. Room to grow and opportunity to change your location within the store."
good,"At store level it was a really good and supportive place to work. The store manager was great, the staff worked well together and got along well. Everyone was fairly happy. THEN, they put a new District Manager in place and everything quickly fell apart. The new DM was more interested in being right than doing the right thing. She threw the store into chaos by walking through and ordering massive changes to the physical layout, with no additional payroll to support the work needed, then when it was completed she would order it all changed around again. Complete chaos. She then moved the store manager, who everybody liked very much, to another store though the store manager did not want to leave, and she replaced  her with someone completely unqualified but related to one of the VP's of the company. The store quickly spiralled downhill with the DM blaming everyone in the store except for those responsible, herself and the new store manager. It was at that point that I tendered my resignation. I went back a few months later and the two staff remaining from when I worked there were miserable and very unhappy. All of us a year earlier had  loved our jobs there."
good,"I really liked this job. My coworkers were all really cool and I liked cashiering and helping customers. However, we were forced to sell memberships and this is what ultimately made me leave the job that I liked. The assistant manager would always call me to the back office to tell me I wasn't doing a good job selling memberships (even gift cards around the holidays; how can you sell gift cards to people who don't come in specifically to buy them?!). He eventually began telling me I would probably be fired soon for my lack of numbers, which is what made me quit. I was a 19 year old kid with no prior sales experience and only got paid $8 an hour, what did they expect me to do? If you're good at sales and get consistently good membership numbers this job is really great, but it's not for someone like me who doesn't feel good about forcing people to buy a $25 card that may not even be useful to them."
good,The coworkers that are like-minded when it comes to pop culture/books are really what made it worth it. however there are some days that makes you want to pull your hair out
good,"I enjoyed working around books and learning. I also enjoyed stocking shelves and other merchandise. I did not always care for how corporate ran the store, and I do not think they always had the employees best interest at heart."
good,My manger was really great but the shift at the time was not. I felt a lot of the time I was left to run the floor by myself so the shift could disappear and not do their job for anywhere up to 10 minutes to an hour at a time. It was disappointing to leave but it was necessary.
good,A typical day at work depends on what position you work in.  No matter where you work you spend your entire day with customers so you learn customer service skills and great people skills.  Would not recommend this job to anyone who doesn't like dealing with people.
good,I loved working there..great store and the hours were good ..had to leave for health reasons .. I would reapply there but live in different state now ..great part time job
good,"If you love books and reading and meeting really cool people, then this is the perfect job for you! It was my first job and although management really gets on you about selling memberships (which was the probably the only reason I hated working there), I don't regret one second."
good,The other staff are Really fun to be around and really nice. Don't know about the other stores my mine and the other store in town one is massive and the other is super small
good,The staff is very relaxed and open to new ideas or new changes. The building itself gives off a homey vibe which is very relaxing for choosing something as a gift for someone or yourself.
good,"I really enjoyed working at Barnes and Noble when I started, but now I feel like I'm left to do too much for too little. It might just be my store, but I feel like no one truly knows what they're doing and I'm left to pick up the slack. The management is often careless when it comes to paid time off and vacation time. I was demoted from a position because I did not have full availability due to school, which is understandable, but I was still expected to perform the same tasks with a pay cut, no benefits, and similar hours. The company as well has lost a lot of it's love for its employees. They're very focused on money and trying to keep the company afloat that they're forgetting to treat those who take care of the stores and make their money with respect. I still love the company, but I feel like they're not approaching things the right way."
good,"When I worked at Barnes and Noble I helped customers find the books that they were looking for. Working there was pretty good, usually it was a relaxed environment except during rushes and when managers needed certain tasks completed."
good,"I enjoyed working at Barnes and nobles college as I was on campus and got to be around students like myself. I learnt a lot of things about books, and the days were always different depending on the period of the year which I loved."
good,"While working here I wore many hats. I was cross trained. I worked the register, in the cafe as well as worked on the book floor. Most of my time was spent in the cafe, unless they were short a person on the register or on the bookfloor. I love being cross trained because there is opportunity to work extra hours and receive more money on your check. The only downside is if you're over hours or if they don't have enough hours, your hours get cut. That's retail in general unfortunately."
good,"I worked for Barnes and Noble as a Store Manager for nearly 30 years and for 25 of those years I thoroughly enjoyed my job. They have an incredible benefits package and the atmosphere was fun and exciting. There was always enough payroll to ensure we were able to offer our customers a world-class shopping experience. Decisions made at the executive level to drastically cut payroll, to restructure their staffing matrix causing some stores to lose a third of their full time staff, and the constant almost daily operational changes that company has begun to implement, has drastically changed the daily atmosphere in stores. The stress level is incredibly high and employee morale is at an all time low. There is no work -life balance  and booksellers are increasingly unhappy. It hasn't helped that the company has had 5 CEOs in the last five years. In spite of it all, I wish the best for the company."
good,"Great place to work, the manager was easy going and understanding. Hours seemed fair and if there was ever a problem with hours they would be fixed quickly given enough time. Slow-paced and casual job."
good,Barnes & Noble (at least from my experience) had a great company culture that especially supported students (as I worked by a university). The managers made you feel part of the team and it was a great way to gain experience early on career-wise.
good,"The workdays are quite pleasant, the pay is certainly fair for a high school student. Management doesn’t allow much advancement to the employees. The people are nice and seldom is there a dispute."
good,"As far as retail jobs go, this is one of the better ones, especially if you love books. It's a lot easier to sell something you're interested in!"
good,"Great place if you're not looking for a serious career."
good,"I worked at Barnes & Noble during the 2018 holiday season as a cashier. It was stressful at times and you have to be able to focus on multiple things at once. I enjoyed my coworkers very much. You will be standing for your entire shift (minus breaks). Overall, nice place to work seasonal for some extra money."
good,"I enjoyed my time (four years) at Barnes and Noble. I love being around books and other media, and it was fun to be around customers and other employees who care about such things. I loved ordering in new supplies, making displays, and zoning through the books regularly to statistically figure out what was worth keeping in the store, what was selling well, etc. However, BN does not make the necessary moves it needs to in order to compete with the big conglomerates that are putting our jobs in danger every single day. The tech is ancient, the pay is terrible, and the benefits are less than desirable. For example, I took a full-time position because I was already working the amount of hours it required but not receiving the benefits; after I decided to change to full-time to get the benefits, I found out that their ""health insurance"" plan does not include BASIC amenities such as prescription insurance. One other thing that is a bummer is the employee ""discount"" is often less than what the customers get, which really lowers team morale. The environment was not fast-paced, but anyone who applies to a Barnes and Noble hoping they will have a relaxed job is incorrect and should look elsewhere. One problem many of my coworkers experienced (I never felt the pressure) was that the managers put a lot of pressure on employees to push the $25 a year membership program. Many customers get very agitated, and more often than you would think, aggressive about it. I saw many, many coworkers in my four years leave because they couldn't handle the stress of the managers putting pressure on them"
good,Seasonal Material handler from Barnes & Noble. I came late into the season and myself and ~12-14 other seasonal people were given a two day notice before we were let go. So keep that in mind. The work itself is typical warehousing duties. The thing that made it for me was the people. Management and especially the workers are very nice and welcoming.
good,"As a total book worm, working at Barnes & Noble was, for me, a very fun job. I worked in shipping and receiving,  processing books and getting them ready to move out to the floor. The culture was relaxed, the managers were patient and flexible. Overall it was a great place to work."
good,Nothing to say it’s retail nothing more. Looking forward to a new opportunity. If they paid better I’d stay forever. There is not enough staff and you can never ever get holidays off.
good,"Barnes and Noble is great to work for as long as you can keep up your new Membership percentage (Which basically is equal to how many people you can convert to the dark side). "
good,"I learned customer service skills in a fast-paced environment. The hardest part of this job was the customers, from my experience so far I have had to learn how to react to people who are opinionated."
good,"Good opportunities for lots of hours, but in the temporary bookseller position I was in customers would dwindle for a while, leaving me with little work to do. Coworkers are mostly nice, but any job does occasionally have coworkers who you clash with. I'm fairly agreeable and got along with most people, but it is a job that would be best suited for introverts that aren't offended easily as sometimes more experienced coworkers can seem condescending or catty, when really they're just concerned about the company. The hardest part of the job is being kind to mean customers and remembering all the technical aspects of the job."
good,Fun paced job where interacting with clients and exploring with them new authors and electronic books was exciting and getting to know the customers on a personal basis.
good,Being a part of the Barnes and Noble environment is fun but stressful. You have to make sure that all tasks are met but the co-workers are fantastic! Everyone is supportive and willing to work with you. As long as you work hard as well.
good,you don't really get to sit unless you're on break. you have to also deal with a lot of angry customers. but the managers were very understanding and one even helped me out of a panic attack.
good,"There's kind of a family feel with the employees here. I did end leaving because I needed to be earning more, but the job itself and my coworkers were great."
good,"The environment at Barnes & Noble is very welcoming and family friendly. The workers are very polite, the customers are understanding if there are shipping problems and since it is on campus, it is fairly easy for students and workers to get there."
good,"A regular day at work was pretty simple. We had a lot of regulars, so it was easy to get orders ready for those people, and they were all sympathetic when things didn't work smoothly."
good,"Not a horrific retail experience, and the atmosphere is generally calm. Long hours standing and re-shelving, and frequent short breaks. The discount is sufficient for those who enjoy purchasing books frequently."
good,good place to work lots of work to do but your surroundings make it better the employees are great the customers are customers so what can ya say but good place
good,"I had a wonderful experience working at Barnes and Noble.  My coworkers were great and everyone treated each other like family.  I chose to leave for personal reasons, but not because of management or anything.  Holidays would get pretty crazy busy, but the hours were better during then.  Pay is minimum wage."
good,"Not the best job ever, but good enough. Not very much room for growth. The company is tanking, so I would advise looking elsewhere. You do get some pretty nice employee perks, though."
good,"My full-time position consists of setting up/taking down/refreshing displays, customer service, planning and hosting store events, and recovering the sales floor. Even though the staff is always pretty busy, everyone is almost always in a good mood, and the management team is approachable and empathetic. Being around books and talking about them all day is a huge plus. MY least favorite part of the job was all the recovery that was needed on top of juggling behind-the-scenes projects - most days, I wish there were at least five of me to get it all done! Full-time people receive good benefits, and the in-store discount is fair."
good,"Because of my involvement with different departments in the store, I was introduced to a plethora of learning environment. In each one, I was instructed and guided proficiently, aiding in the Swift acclimation to the desired output of product performance. The standard of a Barnes and Noble employee is to remain friendly, and to explain that we will bring you to your desired product, not just tell you about it."
good,I worked at a college campus version of the store so it operated as the school store. It would have been better if hours were not either long or too short.
good,"I worked closely with the schools on Maui, traveled all over island to help promote bookfairs and teachers benefit from them. Fun atmosphere in the store and upbeat environment."
good,I enjoyed working at Barnes and Noble even though the pay and hours weren't great. I love books and the customers were mostly great. My main issue with the company was the salaries given weren't livable and most positions were part time.
good,This was a fun place to work for a part-time job.  There was great discounts and a very friendly work environment.  It is a very laid back and casual place to work
good,I worked there for one year before getting let go by the company because  they  had  to fired all full-time non managers. My coworkers were wonderful.
good,its a nice place to work during a summer or when you have to take classes . the job is easy you will be busy only the beginning of the semester and the rest of it you can focus on your study . its fit for people want to work and study
good,When working at Barnes and Noble you need to be able to tell the customer your honest thoughts about the book that thy are asking about. The people are fun to work with and the events that the company does are fun. During the rush hours is when the job is the busiest.
good,The company was dedicated to providing outstanding customer service in an effort to gain business due to competition. This led to a real education in one-stop-shop customer service learning.
good,A typical day at work involved organizing heavy college textbooks while helping customers find books for classes. Contact with professors was frequent.
good,"Everyone is very friendly with the understanding and able to joke about us not being a ""normal"" bookstore. Barnes and Noble College is a college textbook store so be ready for many angry phone calls. But everyone is super supportive as well and friendly."
good,"I liked the job for the majority, just wished they had paid more."
good,My experience with Barnes and Noble was a very fruitful one.  I learned customer service skills and problem-resolution skills.  The managers always provided a comfortable work environment and the employee discounts were great!
good,"My typical was 4-6 hours per day, 3-4 days per week. More hours during the holiday season. How many different types of authors, topics and other related products were offered in store. Management was very helpful and instructive. Workplace culture was quick paced and positive. Hardest part of the job was covering more than one duty at a time ex. doing displays and running a register at the same time. People were the most enjoyable part of the position."
good,"This was the school bookstore we we sold everything from textbooks, to school merchandise to regular reading books. I was able to learn some retail management and was given certain responsibilities such as ordering books for the store and for book signing events."
good,"I made alot of great friends working there, I learned alot. "
good,"Worked at Barnes & Noble Booksellers for over 7 years(full time), was laid off due to the company streamlining its labor plan.  I enjoyed the store I worked at, I always had hours, my managers were wonderful, and all my co-workers were helpful and insightful people."
good,"Company restructuring, was laid off after being with company for 7 years.  Took over 6 years to get promoted. Good benefits, even for part time employees."
good,"Great job Interaction with Military and non-profit agencies. Dealing with school districts and authors was very rewarding. This position gave me the opportunity to do what I do best, Business Development, with very little supervision."
good,It's a good place to work especially for students who need a flexible schedule. Laborious though it is the coworkers are friendly and such. Would recommend to a friend.
good,It was a great learning experience and very fun and accepting work environment. The management team are great for the most part and the company  offers amazing benefits.
good,"Barnes and Noble had good people working in their stores, and the work culture is relaxed. Hours shift frequently though, as does your position in the store (concerning various departments). I recommend this to flexible people who want a retail experience less stressful than many others."
good,"The people you work with are so patient and tolerant because they know there is a lot to grasp at first when you start. At first it will feel overwhelming but the moment you get the hang of things, your confidence will build up and you will be looking forward to learning more and more, and become even more useful."
good,"-Punctuality is very important and being quick to act and efficient is something that will result in success."
good,"I spent the day stocking shelves, organizing books, dusting and cleaning, and inputting information into the computer system. Management was subpar and hours were hard. Overall, it taught me to juggle things that I need to do."
good,Overall a great company to work for. Great benefits and working hours. A strong management team and many great employees. The company strives for a strong bottom line financially and there is some level of double standard but overall well built culture.
good,"Great part time job with lots of available shifts. "
good,Variación de trabajo con horarios cambiados y horas extras aveces
good,"Great place for a young adult to work.  The staff is friendly and overall the workplace was fun.  Great benefits and pay.  Nice quiet place to work, awesome discounts."
good,"I really enjoyed working here, even as a barista. The cafe management was terrible, but the store's main management was wonderful, and I'd often rely on them. My coworkers were like family, everyone was very supportive. It was busy day and night, especially during holidays. My cafe manager verbally harassed me, on a number of occasions. The last straw was when she pulled me into her office, for 3 hours, and berated me on anything and everything. I put in my two weeks right then and there. I would have absolutely loved to stay, but my cafe manager made it so difficult for me. The atmosphere was so wonderful, I loved learning about new books that were coming out, and events that were held were always uplifting and interesting. We got a small discount on books and other merchandise, but cafe drinks or food were not free or discounted."
good,"The main drawback for the company is their lack of competitive compensation. Otherwise, a day of work consists mainly of customer focus. A store's productivity and success is generally mirrored by their leadership."
good,"One of the best retail industries to work in. Despite long shifts and that fast-paced nature of a retail business, it was a light environment. The hourly compensation didn't seem to match the workload, so a higher pay would've been nice. The store in Rockville, MD has an amazing team."
good,"This is a very busy position, with constant running around. Books get moved around every day, so it can be hard to know where everything is when customers are looking for things. But overall the customers were very friendly."
good,"I worked at a Barnes and Noble on a college campus, and they were very flexible with my hours in respect to that. However, I did find that members of management were rude (not in a manner that was unmanageable or life-ruining, just mildly irritating). They only kept a small percentage of temporary hires to keep permanently, which kind of sucked. However other employees were fun to work with. The company treated breaks very seriously, so you never had to worry about not getting a break during your time on the clock. Not the worst job ever."
good,Enjoy putting a smile on for book readers! Barnes and Noble has a great work atmosphere. I had the blessing to work with some the best co-workers at the time.
good,"It was a good place to work. It was mainly students and their parents, so not a whole lot of young kids around. Management is also nice and understanding of students."
good,"The workdays were difficult, as the employers would often give tasks of the booksellers to the baristas. The management was tough and often sat and talked in the office. However, the workplace was fun and engaging at all times and improved my barista skills."
good,"I loved working here, but unfortunately, it ended up being seasonal. I got hired the day before Thanksgiving, and let go the day after Christmas. I would've stayed working there if I could've."
good,At a store level this was a good place to work. If you enjoy interacting with diverse cross section of people this is a great job. This is the aspect I really loved at this position.
good,"this job is a great place to be, the workers and the management are all very helpful. the regulars are always very helpful to the newer staff as well."
good,I very much like working at barnes and noble. Being a barista here is fun and i get to meet so many new people. The co workers were great and willing to cover shifts if needed
good,"llegar . entrar a scaner yh empezar con las ordenes."
good,Great part time job while in college or high school. Flexible hours and nice management. No Benefits for part time employees. Lots of call offs and no repercussions.
good,"It's pretty much like working in any other retail environment. You have to be comfortable working with the public, you have to be approachable and friendly. And you have to sell."
good,Acceptable place of business to work if you enjoy books. Customers and staff during my time were nice and friendly and were always receptive to recommendations.
good,"The day was normaly consistent. Always had something to do wither it was helping someone or making a coffee, all the work was fun and easy. Learned how to make coffee drinks and how important good managment is. Working on black friday was the harest part. There were so many people stoping in with us it was hard to keep up. The most enjoyable thing still was the fact that it was never boring. You are always doing something."
good,This was an environment that appropriately took care of its employees while also making sure to expect the most out of them. I always felt like an appropriate amount of work was expected of me.
good,"If you can get a full time position, the benefits are amazing.  However, the pay is not competitive.  The hours are flexible and the job is easy.  I worked here while going to school and it was nice to have a company work with my schedule and not have to stress out on the job."
good,Good company to work for when maybe fresh out of high school an good way to get introduce into the working world. I thought their benefits were really good at the time. And managers were very understanding to the employee's needs and concerns.
good,"Fun work environment for a retail company"
good,"I like working for Barnes and Noble, it's an easy place to work at. You learn to love the people you work with. Sometimes management might not be really well but there ok."
good,"I worked as a bookseller from 2003-2006. It is very customer focused with a lot of learning potential to learn a skill.The bosses are great, I enjoyed it very much."
good,its ok I love my general manger she's the best . she know how to talk to her employees not only she make us feel comfortable but also cares for us .and I like that about her
good,"Working here is great for college students. It is on campus, the shuttle provides transportation, and we also get a discount on our books. I really enjoy working here."
good,"A typical day at work for management includes opening the store, reviewing projects and reports for accuracy and necessary action, relaying important information in meetings and in one on one interactions with coworkers, etc.  Coaching is important, and I learned how to be more efficient at this.  Higher management can be your best friend and worst enemy at times.  You definitely have to pick your battles, but there can be quite a few of them at times.  Culture is great, albeit relationships come and go fast sometimes due to high turnover.  Overall, a very nice, chill place to work."
good,Helped students locate the correct book. Provide excellent customer service. I would answer the phone and also help associates from other stores locate inventory.
good,"The employees were very friendly and willing to help others. Provided different areas of experience. It was a nice place to work, better if you know english and spanish."
good,I was always on my toes at the book store and I loved the relaxed atmosphere and the management was very relaxed and easy to talk to. My everyday duties were always changing but I was thoroughly trained in everything I did.
good,"Barnes &  nobles is a decent place to work, very friendly atmosphere, only drawback is that the position did not pay that well."
good,"I learned to be a barista, learn how to make drinks and more. Not enough hours of work or days i received. I learned well. great work place and great people to work with."
good,"It isn't the best but it isn't the worst job. It's a lot of making sure that the shelves look presentable and full, helping customers find books and ordering it for them if it isn't in stock, and recommending books as well. The employees were amazing."
good,"Great fun when it comes to product and the perks of the job. "
good,"It has been a pleasure to work with the team of people that I have worked with over the past few years. However there were no opportunities for me to move up in management although I was required to go through the training. I would also handle certain parts of a job that were not within my job description, without compensation."
good,Okay. Good way to get foot in the dor for starting work. Daily tasks included customer service and ringing up customers. Must be independent when it comes to training and learning company guideline.
good,"Kept me busy, Great support from supervisors. Task were always well explained and simple.There was a focus on us being happy and therefore making the customers happy."
good,"I enjoyed working here."
good,Enjoyed working this job during the school year. Worked with peers and learned all the departments to make me a versatile employee.
good,"Easy-going environment with a lot of support from co-workers and management. Typical day will involve meeting with team, selecting user stories to complete throughout the day, working independently and/or with team, end-of-day review, code reviews, meeting with clients and/or stakeholder if required etc. Learned a little bit about cucumber on the job and other tools. Loved the people here and how friendly and helpful everyone is. Hardest part of the job is meeting client's changing expectations but through our 2 week sprints it is manageable."
good,"Very nice place to work. Managed inventory, organized store, trained new employees, ordered and stock all inventory, worked closely with school to ensure best possible working relationship"
good,"Great job satisfaction.  Enjoyed my co-workers and our customers.  What is better than working with books?  And I got to conduct our children's story hour on occasion."
good,It was decent work for good pay and decent hours. For seasonal work it is a great first job. It could get tedious to close. Why do I need more words in this review.
good,"I usually worked in the evenings and knew the closing routine well, completing all cleaning, restocking, and customer service needed, sometimes as the only employee there. I worked weekends then too, and therefore know the opening routine as well. I like working with coffee, and enjoyed the register and espresso machine duties most, though I will never shy away from scraping dried milk off from under the counter."
good,I got along really well with all of my co-workers and I still go and visit sometimes. Sometimes there were really long days on your feet but it was never unbearable.
good,"Was a great place to work"
good,It started as 2nd job during the holidays. I was kept on and enjoyed the environment and most of my coworkers. I learned about a great deal of books that I hadn't really known about before. The pay could have been better but was equal to the amount of work required.
good,"Good place to work with varied responsibilities daily.  High turnover among staff made flexibility a must. Unfortunately, revolving door of managers made a consistent management style difficult to maintain. Free book lending program for staff members a huge perk."
good,"This job was able to provide me with extra money whilst working as a manager elsewhere; it fulfilled that purpose, but it was only a temp position. I like the job well enough for the 6 months I was there."
good,I was not given tasks that were impossible to handle. She handled confrontation from irate costumers very well without losing composure.
good,Assisting customers with what they are looking for. Plus making sure the book or item is in their hands or ordered for them
good,at Barnes and Noble as a merchandise manager. At B&N I oversaw a staff of close to one hundred and twenty employees and assisted in the opening and running a fifteen million dollar facility. I also handled the purchasing of product and product placement.
good,I learned how to manage time and stock many items. also to have patience with customers and monitor in-store inventories and manage work assignment
good,"Greeting and helping customers, answering phone calls, help locate a certain item/product, cashier. "
good,"This is a great place to work as a part time employee. If you want to advance, this is not the place for you. The head cashiers all move on due to pressure on them from mgmt and from the fact that the company does not allow them to progress their career further."
good,I like putting smiles on peoples faces every time i successfully helped the customer on what they needed.  It also helps my determination skills when I have a difficult time getting what the customers need.  I'll keep going until i fullfilled the customers need
good,"As someone who loves to read, I really enjoyed working here. Helping customers with book recommendations, was one of my favorite things. I was in charge of the bargain, magazine and gift department. I really appreciated the opportunity I was given to run it my way. Discovering and creating a more officiant way of organizing my department. This position really honed my memory and organizational skills."
good,This was my first job ever started from the warehouse shipping and receiving product and made my way up to management. If not for job-corps I probably  would of stayed at this job.
good,"Overall they treated their employees with great respect and honor. If you way beyond, it was recognized and you were shown that recognition."
good,"Full of life and energy. A place where everyone works hard. If you enjoy waking up early, it's wonderful. I, honestly, grew to enjoy waking up early and arriving at work before 5AM."
good,Always on your feet.  Great co-workers.  Seasonal employees don't get paid too much. This bookstore was located on a college campus.
good,It was a college bookstore owned by Barnes & Noble. It's a fun place to work because everyone working there is college student.
good,"If you are looking for a temporary part-time job while in school, this is a great job.  I thoroughly enjoy working here, the one downside is the students can sometimes be so rude and obnoxious, but as with any customer service job that is to be expected.  Tough but fair management, just not enough work to survive outside of part-time temporary while taking classes."
good,The place has a diverse staff with everyone being friendly and outgoing. no problems with anyone and maid many friends during the time i was there.
good,"A typical day included checking inventory, assisting customers, and opening, and closing meetings. The hardest part of the job was meeting the demands of the customers on very hectic days. The best part was being able to assist customers who were also students to feel happy and satisfied with their purchases."
good,My co workers were and are like family.  Loved selling books and talking about books.  Allowed me to learn all departments of  book selling.  Was able to move around within the departments and up in position.
good,"It was a different time when I worked for B&N, the business model and the way people find and obtain books has changed dramatically. At the time they paid much better than most other retail companies. I can not say enough about their benefits. Their benefits were actually better than some I had at Fortune 500 companies later in my career. I worked here when I was young but it was a fun place to work, terrific benefits and exposure to great literature."
good,"Had a great time in the 2 years I was there, Definitely learned alot about the job and about myself as an employee and worker. Quite an enjoyable time spent there."
good,great place to learn and move foward. always something new to learn.  co-workers are great - always helpful.  free snacks. free drinks
good,"Fun place to work, coworkers were friendly and shared book recommendations. Management was well organized and helpful."
good,"A typical day at work at the Barnes and Noble Campus Bookstore was usually relaxed but still challenging.  My day to day duties were to provide customer service to students and faculty in relation to the textbooks they needed, process the sale and return of books, stock and organize shelves, and just make sure the store appeared presentable.  This job allowed me to gain skills in customer service, such as patience, determination, and time management.  I always made sure I kept the customers feeling calm and appreciated by the company, while also assisting them with their problems as quickly and accurately as possible.  The hardest part of this job at first was dealing with hostile customers, but I quickly learned that you cannot take that personally and it is all part of the job.  The most enjoyable part was being able to help people, and challenging myself to do a better job every day.  The management was very nice, welcoming, and helpful when I was new and needed training, as well as my coworkers."
good,Very good management and fun environment. Everyone was generous and kind there. The manager was very helpful and I enjoyed working there.
good,"This is a good company to work for if you need a second job or if you're currently in school. They're flexible with the scheduling and very understanding about other commitments. However, it's hard to make them your primary job. They're very careful about scheduling you just enough hours to keep you working there while keeping you very far from being scheduled enough to pay bills."
good,"Head cashier of Barnes & Noble, responsibilities included daily deposits, balancing cashier drawers.  Also provided customer service both in person and on the phone. Filled book orders for high schools, special request."
good,Working for Barnes and Noble was a fantastic learning experience.  I worked in shipping/receiving in the warehouse.  I enjoy reading so this was a great place to work.  I only left because I was looking for something full-time and the company was not able to offer a full time position.
good,This place was great to work for however the extreme hour cut forces many of us to leave. I liked helping customers choose their purchases and discuss other possibilities.
good,"The people who work there are wonderful and make it a job you look forward to going to, but the cooperation is extremely stubborn and unwilling to change their ways or listen to any of their employees which is incredibly frustrating."
good,For my first college job I love working at Barnes 'n Noble. I have been trained all over the store and have become an essential worker to the store for filling in for those who call off or when they need more people to work.
good,"accounts receivable and payable,stocked shelves and did shipping and receiving.Interacted with customers.Worked with students and met a lot of great friends."
good,"Barnes and Noble was a very fun, fast-paced environment to work. I enjoyed beginning as a cashier and working my way out to the customer service desk. Helping customers find books or answering questions for them about anything in the store was a great feeling when I was on the floor as a customer service rep. I also enjoyed working at the Nook kiosk and enjoyed helping customers to decide if they wanted to purchase an e-reader."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Barnes & Nobles College in the beginning. My coworkers and bosses were friendly and fun to work with, but for someone with anxiety around large crowds, I would not recommend this position. I eventually decided that the stress of working in such an environment was too much for my health. I parted on very good terms with all of my coworkers and bosses."
good,"Barnes and Noble is a great company to work for. I worked in the music department, I spent my shifts taking inventory, searching for media, and helping customers."
good,There was always something you could win for being a hard worker. A lot of perks if you love books because there was always new books we got to see before we even sold them. I loved the people and everything was always quiet and organized.
good,"I love working for B&N.  I work in the Nook office.  It's a great atmosphere, very casual and laid back, and there are unlimited free snacks and drinks.  I love my bosses.  However, I'm a temp.  And because of that, I get paid hourly, and don't get paid for lunch.  I never make a full 40 hours a week, and I have no benefits at all.  I really like working here and I would have liked for it to become a career, but there's no chance of this becoming permanent.  I've been a so-called temp for over a year, some of the other temps have been there three and four years.  So while this is an absolutely great company...make sure you can get a real full-time position if you want to work here."
good,"I've thoroughly enjoyed the years I've been with this company They provided flexibility and a comfortable work environment. They provided many opportunities for growth and were always quick to assist in training for higher positions. My coworkers are wonderful people who all share similar passions for the workplace, therefore making every work day easy and enjoyable."
good,"One of the better retail work environments. There is always something to do. Lots of customers to interact with and give recommendations on your favorite books. However, there is little room for advancement and the management staff don't always show their appreciation of your hard work."
good,You werent allowed to read while you were there.  I found that kind of ironic.  Working in the children's department was horrible.
good,All the employees got along very well and we all worked well together to get all reports and displays done in a required time frame.  Management was excellent and were available for any questions.
good,"•	Responsible for establishing rapport with customers and identifying/responding to their needs"
good,"Barnes was a fun place to work.  Great people who love books and a comfy atmosphere that makes you want to settle in.  However, some of the companies decisions over the past few years have made it kind of a rocky prospect.  I hope they can figure out how to make it out of their financial troubles, because who wouldn't want them around?  Bookstores are important."
good,"Environment that challenges you to achieve, fully supports your ability to do so, and recognizes and rewards your efforts when you do."
good,"Working in the receiving department of B&N, I kept track of what was received, then sort them into the different departments, as well as kept track of what was shipped. Pricing the books to match the discounted price was also part of my responsibilities. Many times I would move pallets of inventory received and report on damages and items that were stolen. Being a fan of reading, I loved working in the bookstore and made many friends to this day."
good,"Work at Barnes & Noble a very busy, focused and professional atmosphere, designed to delight customers and accomplish all our tasks with utmost efficiency."
good,Fast paced with orders for customers and memorization was highly needed.
good,"I was responsible for making sure the office ran efficiently when the supervisor was available and in absence.  I made sure coworkers were giving accurate info to our clients and customers.  I created Standards of Procedure manuals for my supervisor and coworkers for the soft/hardware applications used in our mass shipment processes via UPS WorldShip.  I also provided solutions for performance enhancements for myself and fellow staff.  I replenished most consumable supplies for my department and for several copy/fax machines in my custody.  I made purchases for members of other departments for office supplies and some appliances.  I made bank deposits at the local branch. I picked up and dropped mail and other parcels at USPS, UPS, DHL, and FedEx locations.  I distributed incoming packages and some mail throughout the company.  I was a transporter for the HR department for special events and for intern drop offs.  I represented the company by delivering and taking photos for our annual donations to the United Way.  I planned and presented my department for our annual Take Your Child to Work Day events."
good,Learn how to work together and try to learn new things when you are on the job.
good,"The typical day at work as a salesperson is mostly do sales/cashier and answer product questions. But, a lot of times, there are customers that will purchase books with financial aid voucher that requires for data entry skills. Some will rental the books that require different procedures, too. Usually the peak time are the first and last two weeks of the quarter. So, we have to provide service in the fast paced environment that sometimes only allow a very short break (10 minutes). There are also no healthcare benefits, the only benefit is the employee discount for product purchases. The most enjoyable part of the job is when each of the customers satisfied with my service. My co-workers and me always worked while aiding each other with helps. Therefore, the service will progress smoothly."
good,"Great working, lots of experience shelving and re-shelving"
good,I enjoyed this job the most as I was able to use my selling skills and interpersonal skills when conflicts would occur. The staff was very friendly to one another and other management was willing to listen to new ideas or problems being faced in a department.
good,"Perhaps it's a regular retail setting, but if you enjoy books or reading you'll enjoy your time there."
good,"I loved my job here - the customers, the management, and my co-workers.  I worked 9:45 a.m. to 2:45 on Tuesdays and Thursdays, except for the Christmas holidays when my hours increased. When new management came in and took over, they cut out my part time hours and wanted me to work full time, which I did not want to do. "
good,"I have been blessed to work for such an amazing company and with a solid, hard working team."
good,"I'm either positioned to work on the book floor to help customers find books, answer their questions, and put merchandise away or I'm at the cash register ringing up customers, providing customer service, and wrapping gifts for guests. I've learned better organizational skills, how to provide great customer service, and how to work with the customer in order to better troubleshoot the problem and answer their questions.  The company is like a well oiled machine in terms of management and my co-workers, which makes my job much easier to execute.  My favorite part about the job would have to be the fact that I'm surrounded by something I love and something I enjoy introducing people to: books. However, the hardest part about this job would have to be the late work hours on the weekends when we close at 11pm."
good,"Every day is fun, challenges  and accomplishment story."
good,There'a a bit of turmoil related to where books and the company will go into the future that sort of trickles down onto everyone.
good,"I love books and this was basically my dream job."
good,The book business is a fun place to be.  You meet interesting people on a daily basis and it is very laid-back at the store level.
good,Very culture oriented company. Operates like a family enviornment.
good,I went to work and the day would fly by.  I would stock shelves and help customers.
good,"Depending on which department you work, Barnes and Noble can be a fun place. The Music Department was a great place to work because the customers who weren't asking where the restrooms were were great.  Management, however, wasn't. If any backup was needed in the department, 2 out of 5 of the managers couldn't help with anything (if the other three showed up at all). The booksellers and music sellers were fun to work with and were pretty reliable. It is a retail job, so the most difficult part of the job was getting publicly reprimanded when things went wrong, even if it wasn't your fault. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping people find difficult/ancient items."
good,Management was very understanding of the students in the sense that they knew that we had much bigger priorities especially during finals week.
good,"Fellow employees are all friendly, management works with you to create a positive work environment, hours are flexible, full benefits for full time staff."
good,Enjoyed taking care of customers and interacting with staff.
good,"A typical day  would be working at different station stocking books, working cash register, and customer service"
good,"They take themselves too seriously. Its a bookstore, not a cancer research."
good,The company is light years behind on any info structure for Cafe employee. They have passion but the company needs to put more financial backing into the profitable cafes that they hold. As they already know that there is no moneys in books there is plant in coffee and that equals more payroll dollars. The company has no big programs or equal programs utilized to regular coffee companies in the market.
good,"A typical day at work would consist of me checking out customers, managing other cashiers, stocking merchandise, counting inventory. I learned to manage others. Management was easy going and goal oriented, as well as flexible with scheduling. Coworkers are easy going as well and management did a good job of hiring good personnel. The hardest part of the job was counting inventory, and maintaining good stamina from being on your feet all shift long."
good,"Working at a bookstore is both rewarding and challenging. Much of the physical part comes from shelving new product that we get in, redoing displays, and maintaining the general look of the store.  There's always something to do during the day, even the super slow ones.  Organize the stacks, replenish displays, or check sales to see if there are any trends going on."
good,"Barnes and Noble has allowed me to grow and fine tune my skills as a manager. Over the course the pas few years, I have learned better time management and productivity skills. My primary focus is to assist our customers figure out what they need and get them the products that they want. Along with the customer's within our store, I almost exclusively assist our Institutional Customers. I help obtain books, at a special discount, for our local schools and Institutions. "
good,"I loved working at Barnes & Noble. I was able to interact with many types of people. It got me out of my ""shell"" and I saw how good with people I can be. I was always eager to help someone find what they were looking for or help a coworker/manager with a project."
good,"Great co-workers and many great customers. However, it was unorganized along with an untidy work space. Improved my people, leadership, and teamwork skills."
good,I loved working for Barnes and Noble. It's is a place that will actually reward you for your hard work. My management team was probably the best that I have been exposed to. You will be put into a position to excel. It's the place where I really learned what great customer service means. It's also where I came into my own as a salesman.
good,"Crazy busy but we try to have a little fun."
good,Boast being on campus so they work around your class schedule. Hard to get a full time job. Lots of seasonal positions. Have to work every game day and weekends. Busy at the beginning and end of semester
good,A great company with great co-workers and management as well.
good,check bags entering and exiting the store greet customers provide safe and trustworthy customer service
good,"The ability to cross train as customer service representative, music, childrens, technology, café, cash registers."
good,Great job for an individual who needs extra money but definitely not a long term job.
good,"each day I meet new people and recognize old ones. Although it can be slow most days, there's always something to do. My managers are awesome, but there are things I don't like that they have to enforce through higher ups. I doubt I'll ever get a promotion in cafe. But the atmosphere is great and I never go home with more bad experience other than burnt hands or a little stress. I love working there!!"
good,I looked forward to walking into the cafe and interacting with fellow employees and customers.
good,I liked this place because I was surrounded by books. infanant learning. but pay was not great for someone looking to make it on there own.
good,"I work in the music department and have from the beginning and the daily tasks include/included customer service, various projects for the department, and daily tasks such as cleaning and organizing sections and product. I have learned a lot about the product I was selling and the customer demographic for various things. I have enjoyed the management through this company and have always felt them to be caring and understanding people, always looking out for me and taking the time to make sure I understand the job and the department I care for. The hardest part of the job now is managing it, being in the lead position and having many more responsibilities over time, but it is also the part I enjoy. I love looking over this area and taking care of it in my own special way while upholding the guidelines required to lead it."
good,This was a good work experience as a student. It allowed me to improve my soft skills such as effective communication.
good,It was a very relaxed store with employees who got along splendid. I would recommend it to others because the job is not stressful and I actually enjoyed going into work.
good,"Maintained a well kept work environment, whilst students inquired information about different textbooks and procedures to complete their classes. The rush at the beginning and end of the school semester was the busiest and required me to work with many people at once organizing and prioritizing different inquiries. The most fulfilling part would be the sense of family as everyone began to work together helping one another."
good,"fun work place with books, very flexible company, tries hard to promote, good benefits and outside perks"
good,Marketing and sales through all marketing avenues from direct mail to organizing and promoting events
good,"Great discount, but promotion from within is hard to come by."
good,"management of industrial work.Assisted youth in developing appropriate skills.I am highly skilled in the use of computers and the Internet, including Microsoft Office, Internet searches, and troubleshooting computer software and hardware."
good,"enjoyed making drinks and food"
good,"a multi-tasking job, and surrounded by good employees; I have learned a lot about customer service and dealing with different products"
good,"A typical day at Barnes n Noble has its days. The store can be super busy and the next day be super slow. I have learned many responsibilities as long as i been with the company including money handling, maintaining cleansliness, keeping customers happy and satified even when we get a difficult customer. I get along with all my co workers and we always work as a team. The hardest part of the job would be keeping the customers happy with their customized orders and making sure they leave with a smile. Customer is a very hard job anywhere and whatever the job it may be."
good,"passed out culinary uniforms to incoming freshmen"
good,"Working at Barnes and Noble has been a positive experience for me. I've learned how to manage my day and productivity while juggling at least half a dozen responsibilities at once. From the beginning of the day and the arrival of days delivery, usually between 1-2 tons of product, to working through the product while assisting the sales floor and management team as required."
good,Working the cash register or the customer service desk always being a help to customers. Managers were nice role models and co-workers were always friendly and helpful as a team. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help the customer and give them exactly what they wanted.
good,It was a good place to work and learn from students and management. It was fun and the people are nice and friendly.
good,"A general day had me receiving and stocking inventory, adding items to the sales list, interfacing with distributors and making sure the paperwork was in order."
good,"• Customer Relations"
good,"I was responsible for the non-fiction side of books, as well as occasionally acting as a bookseller.  I ordered books, sent back remainders, made sure the shelves were maintained and worked with other employees to keep my section stocked."
good,"Typical day is either on POS or on bar, making drinks for people and selling our bakery items. We clean the outside cafe area regularly and keep our work area as clean and efficient as possible.  Mix of regular coworkers with some turnover, creating an casual but professional environment. Our manager is ruthless but great to work with/under; she is hardest on herself and expects us to do the best we can.  The hardest part of the job would be dealing with massive rushes and helping unhappy customers; the most enjoyable being getting to meet so many people and making their day just a bit better."
good,"I worked for Barnes & Noble Booksellers for nearly nine years, held five different positions, across three different states, and loved working with almost everyone I came into contact with. "
good,"A typical day at work would depend on your shift that day. For the most part, you were catering to customers while trying to maintain a high quality cafe standard. I learned a lot about what it means to be a ""barista"" and how to make Starbucks beverages. I also learned a lot about serving food, rather than making it. Most of our food was thaw-and-serve, so I didn't get to exercise as much of my baking knowledge as I would've liked. For the most part, the management staff is fantastic. Managers that have been there for more than a year, are the key to the success that comes out of there. Managers are more like your own co-workers and love to goof around and have fun, just like the rest of us. Co-workers are beyond amazing and I could never say enough to describe the marvelous staff there. It's the best job I could've imagined having for my first job, which is why I've stayed there for almost 2 years. There were no real struggles or challenges to the job, aside from the solo-closing of the cafe. There was more good, than bad in the job, and the overall experience was the most enjoyable part of the job. Helping customers, making their day, working with the best staff ever -- they're all some of the best parts of the job."
good,A typical day during the holiday season is busy which is what I love.  Management is laid back and allows you to work on your own and my co-workers are like family. The hardest part of the job is that the pay doesn't match the workload which Is why I'm looking for part time work.  The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that I am assisting customers to the best of my abilities.
good,"Working at Barnes and Noble is a lot of fun.  Everyone there is full of energy and we all get along really well.  On slow days when there aren't a lot of customers, we busy ourselves setting up new displays, or making sure the ones already set up are looking their best.  The hardest part of any day is a difficult customer.  We try our best to meet the customer's needs and expectations and try to keep them as returning customers.  Sometimes it is necessary to partner with a manager to solve the problem, but usually all turns out well.   "
good,When I started working there everything seemed fine and fair. Within the first 2 weeks there was a drastic change of management throughout the entire store.  Working in the cafe there was always something to do.  It's such a great feeling to help people start their day off on a good note.
good,"A great store, staffed with positive, friendly people who enjoy their workplace."
good,Learned alot about books and organizing.  My favorite parts were organizing the books and recommending books to the customers.  The hardest part was not spending my entire paycheck on books.
good,"B&N is a very interesting place. It has much more to it than books, there is music, dvds, Nooks, B&N cafe. If you are a hard working, sales driven, flexible person this is a great place to work."
good,"A typical day at work includes re-shelving misplaced books, providing excellent customer service, maintaining the cafe, receiving the shipments and prepping them for the next day, cafe preventive maintenance."
good,I enjoyed working with the customers and all the wonderful books. I got along very well with most of my fellow employees and continue my friendship with most today
good,"Barnes and Noble Cafe was fast pace an thrilling. I learned that you cant always make people happy, but a cookie and a smile goes along way. Management and co/workers Made the Job Easy for lack of better word. the hardest part of the Job was learning all the coffee types and styles.My most enjoyable moment was meeting a Foreigner for the first time and Making Her A Godiva Hot chocolate with a waffer cookie straw. An seening her Smile So Big over something so simple.made my day and i Guess it made her day too."
good,"The overall job was most enjoyable. It consisted of helping students find the items they needed for class as quickly as possible with as little hassle as possible because they were usually low on time. Co-workers were magnificent, had great senses of humor but knew when to hold it in and get the job done."
good,"good job. great managers, work life balance loved the job, but I got laid off"
good,large retail with a small company feel. i love working with books.
good,Great temporary job to get through school. Flexible hours and no weekends.
good,The staff made the work day fun. Serving my fellow classmates was also quite enjoyable.
good,I learned how to become a team player and how to handle situation under pressure.
good,"The UCF Bookstore was a great place to work around a college student. I worked there for half of my undergrad and most of my graduate degree. The culture is almost all college students, and managers are willing to work with students to schedule work around their school needs. Co-workers can be lazy and management does not always stick up for their employees, often going behind their back to please a customer against store/company policy. I would not work there again but I did benefit from working there for the time that I did work."
good,"Typical day includes stocking shelves before opening and during, helping guest find books and other products."
good,Through out my years with B & N I was able to advance by hard work and wanting to get ahead. I enjoyed my customers. I was eager to learn new things which helped in my advancement.
good,"Even when the traffic is heavy, the service is smooth and remarkably not too stressful. As long as you work promptly and efficiently, there is no reason to have any issues here whether you are working at the register or a customer service."
good,"I love working at Barnes and Noble. The managers are flexible with my student schedule and will do whatever they can to give me the hours I need. I primarily work on the book floor where I aid customers in finding whatever books they need, or giving them any advice on which books to purchase. The main goal is to put the book in the customers hand, but also to make time to truly engage them so you can offer your best services. My co-workers are a huge part of that. We all help each other out with finding books or giving recommendations to the customer, and through the work days we build strong relationships as well. Managers do their best to train employees efficiently, but also like to let their charges learn the ropes of the business simply through experience. Knowing specifically what to recommend to different customers is probably the biggest challenge, but the joy of being surrounded by books makes it all the worth while."
good,"I learned exceptional customer service, teamwork, satisfying customers all the while getting to sell books which enrich all of our lives."
good,Fun volunteer work. My coworkers and I had a really good time gift wrapping for kids mostly.
good,It was an ok place to work. But there was a lot of turnover in management which caused problems in the workplace.
good,"Barnes and Noble hires very friendly and welcoming people which makes coming to work very easy. There is always something to do and each bookseller is trusted to complete the task without being micro-managed. Sometimes the management needs to be more on the same page as far as dress code but for the most part, they are cohesive."
good,Strong retail environment. Grew with the company from part time sales associate to Assistant Store Manager. Company promotes growth within associates.
good,"Great management, Staff is very friendly and helpful. I enjoyed working with my co-workers and being able to serve customers in a very efficient manner."
good,Barnes and Noble is a great company to work for. I love the new direction the company is moving in.
good,I got to work a Harry Potter midnight release...! I liked working on the floor and in cafe. Christmas is the best with all of the large picture books.
good,A typical day at Barnes and Noble College consist of students coming in for textbooks or scantrons for their exams. My experience in cashiering has come from working at Barnes and Noble college along with my customer service knowledge. The job itself is not hard or stressful during most of the year. At the beginning and end of a semester we have the most customers come into the store. Students buy and sell back their books during these times but it never becomes overwhelming as our mangers schedule accordingly.
good,The people and environment are great. Everyone gets along and honestly cares for each other. You make lasting relationships here so you actually enjoy going to work each day.
good,"B&N was a good home for me for 17 years of my career: I started as a part-time temporary holiday hire at B.Dalton, which was the former mall division of the company. As an English and History major, I came into the company with, perhaps, more book knowledge than the average applicant; that knowledge, however, was but a fraction of what I would eventually leave with. Over the years, as my book knowledge grew, so did my knowledge of people. Not only did we have great staff working in our store, but we had a pretty good customer base."
good,"Fun place to work, must love books, basic selling skills more customer service."
good,This job was a dream for a booklover like myself. Being surrounded by others who loved books and making recommendations fulfilled a lifelong dream.
good,was a great place to work-very interesting product base & always changing merchandising iniatives
good,I have worked in every depart and I genually enjoy each for different reasons. I find that sometimes the biggest hurdle at work is your fellow employees but at least we all share and common interest.
good,"I worked at Barnes and Noble during an upheaval where brick-and-mortar bookstores were going out of business.  There was a possibility that Barnes and Noble would not survive competition from the digital industry.  "
good,"BN has gone through many changes in recent years and that has had a stressing effect on its employees. By and large though, a pleasant place to work with excellent middle management but poor VP and C-suite follow through."
good,"Pros:"
good,"I enjoy working with this company. My management was good, and they really work with you on scheduling. The most frustrating part was dealing with the customers in the cafe. Sometimes the manager would make us stay later than we were scheduled when closing"
good,"This company is a place where customer service and product perfection is priority. It is a fun and customer service driven environment. So, if you love making customers happy leaving this is the ideal place."
good,I worked for them for 25 years before being laid off. They were sold recently and Im curious to see how they can bounce back from years of low sales and other issues hindering growth.
good,"I had a good time working at this store. I did most of my time in the café and was happy that. The café was run well, clean and happy employees. I would work at a Barnes and Noble again."
good,I am new to Rome and this was my high school job. My Co Workers were wonderful and working with customers was easy. Management could use a bit of work
good,"Barnes and Noble was a fun and easy job, anyone who is interested in books and learning more about them should definitely apply there. I learned different techniques when it came to sorting books out in their correct sections and even by that finding new books to read."
good,"I enjoyed working at Barnes & Nobles for the time i was there. Good work hours, great employees and i made alot of friends. Very relaxed environment & disstressful."
good,"There is a lot of down time at this job. So, it can get boring fairly quickly. However, it can get busy very quickly as well. So, the job is okay if bring a book or homework, as a student, to get done."
good,A typical day at work is interacting with customers and making drinks and preparing food. I learned what good customer service can do for the work environment if you have a good attitude about what you are doing you will have a better time while working.
good,"I learned so much when I worked for BN, the registers, how to approach customers, how to sell. Early on management was super accommodating and work culture was very friendly. I enjoyed helping find the perfect gift for customers the most whereas the hardest part of the job was convincing customers to purchase for unnecessary things. A typical day for me was a closing shift, so doing a sweep of the store so no customer gets left behind, retouching tables and putting back misplaced books or items."
good,"Its a fun place to work! Most coworkers were easy to get along with. You get discounts. They cut back hours, and fired fulltime staff except for managers. Didn't make nearly enough money to live on since pay is low, and hours are inconsistent. It's a great place for students or retirees. You get yearly raises if you do good at your job."
good,Worked there and the managers were very unprofessional and not understanding about me quitting. They were also rude when I returned to the store to shop after I was not employed here.
good,"I love working at Barnes & Noble.  If you are at the right location, management is flexible and easy going.  I love helping customers locate books, periodicals, and toys. Co-Workers are also great.  They are also passionate about reading and books."
good,Everyone was very good to get along with. Managers were nice. They expected you to be on time and get your job done. At times it’s very fast paced and on days that aren’t busy the manager will have you cross train to other department or assemble displays. You will always be busy. But I liked that
good,"I worked mostly in the Cafe, which was stressful at times like any food service job can be. I think overall the corporate overlords focused too much on the bottom line (as they do in most large U.S. companies), which led to employee burn out, understaffing, etc. Maybe this will change with the recent purchase of B&N."
good,when I was working here It made me feel like I was a part of a huge family. the atmosphere was always loving and everyone was willing to help if there were issues.
good,I rang up customers and cleaned up the sales floor. I learned where everything was. Management was friendly. Workplace culture encouraged reading. Most enjoyable part of the job was recommending books.
good,It was a good company to work for but my job was eliminated after we got off the mainframe platform.  I was able to learn about additional software products that I wasn't familiar with.  I also was able to make new friends while I was there.
good,"Definitely easy going, but of course there are busy days. Lots of formulas, etc, but easy to catch onto. It pays a little more than minimum wage but very hard to live on if you are part time."
good,"This is a good job to have if you want a more relaxed, slow-placed job. The people who shop and work there are friendly and coworkers are always able to help"
good,"If you love books, it's a great place to work. morning shifts start with shelving and organizing sections, you will do this throughout the day. there is always something to do, so boredom will not be a problem. You will meet and interact with a variety of customers, good and bad."
good,This was me first job I ever had and it was fun to be on the sales floor to help customers finding what they need or questions they have. The downside is this just happen me like 3 times only in which they call me in the back and do something like I guess they just want even in the front and back but overall I am mostly in the sales floor than the back. The getting job part is just online and its somewhat straight forward and to see did you get hired just have to wait a few weeks or so by email or phone call.
good,"The people are talented and genuinely concerned with your well being. If you are looking for a large company with tons of structure and the same routine every day, this is not the place for you. Everyone here is motivated to do great work. Those that thrive in a creative and flexible environment and are not afraid of paving the way do well here."
good,"- My typical work day included re-stocking book and merchandise shelves, helping customers locate a specific item either in the store or online for order, and being cashier for customers. "
good,"Barnes and Noble was a great first job. Personally I love books and assising customers in finding the right book for them was a reward in of its own."
good,"I've been working for Barnes and Noble for over two years now and I don't intend on leaving. I am a book lover, and the store's emphasis is putting a book in the customer's hand, and having a conversation about it. This is exactly how it should be, and I love it."
good,"Nice place to work, good people to work with.  Generally the shifts are fun because of the co-workers.  The work is not terribly difficult or physical.  If you like retail work, I think this is one of the better places to be."
good,"I only worked part time. but the people i worked with were great. The work was pleasant, and the managers were always helpful. Great job for a college or high school student who like to read."
good,B&N is a great place to work. The staff is dedicated and has an excellent grasp of their responsibilities. I would recommend this company for anyone who is looking to get into the retail business.
good,I only work part time now but have been full-time at other points here and they've always been flexible with me. My main concern is the way retail is going and if there will be job security going forward.
good,"being passionate about books  and becoming a bookseller is like a calling, but the changes that the company has undergone are making it increasing difficult to stay with the company."
good,"People are fun to work with, but when the cafe get busy it can be very unorganized. Managers can lack some communication skills or tact when talking about position changes and employee responsibilities."
good,"Barnes and Noble was certainly a dream job. Though my experience didn't last long I met a lot of good people there. Staffing wasn't always great, but it gave me opportunity to get experience as a bookseller. I was a bookseller in-training and preferred that to working café. Selling books is a great experience. And the benefits of Advanced reader Copies is something I'll always treasure! The hardest part of the job was trying to keep up with someone less experienced, or even for myself trying to find a good way to sell memberships. Workplace culture… ehh, management wasn't the best, in-fact they were a big creepy and sometimes a bit high-handed due to the their roles as store-managers. I learned that selling books is what I want to do, for a long time."
good,"This warehouse is great if you speak Spanish. The company can be quite isolating if you do not speak Spanish. They try to accommodate, though. Everyone is very nice."
good,"Its typical retail, but book people tend to be more eccentric. With all the changes in the retail trends, new initiatives happen all the time and gets cumbersome."
good,"A typical day at work as a cashier is pretty chill. First, you count your till then you open the doors. Interact with customers, listen to their needs and wants and provide for them to the best of your ability. Basic retail situations plus the customers that are occasionally rude."
good,"B&N recently implemented significant staff reductions... Replaced IT staff with off-shore consulting resources to save money.  It was a great place to work, but growing pains with shift to external development teams."
good,"It was great working there. Sadly for me, the pay was not enough to live on and I was in need of health insurance that they didn't offer because I was only part time."
good,"was slow paced work days.  had good management.  the culture their was good, and others were helpful.  the hardest part was dealing with a lot of down time."
good,"Some opportunities to move up in the company, somewhat flexible hours and employee appreciation days. Better geared towards part time work after the company discontinued many full time positions. Knowledge of our Membership card and proactively reaching sales goals will guarantee more hours."
good,"I enjoyed working at Barnes and Noble. My co-workers were nice and easy to talk to, while my superiors were open to me asking questions and were willing to give me any help I needed."
good,I have been going there for years as a customer and I love this place. Everyone is always super nice and talkative. The manager makes it easy to remember all of the recipes and once you have it down there isn't a drink on the menu you won't be able to make.
good,"I never had an issue with the company itself. Having to push the credit card did make me feel a little uncomfortable, but overall no issues with the company. I was unfortunate to have a not so great manager. She was extremely condescending and rude."
good,"Wonderful place to work. Loved being around the books and cafe and the people there. However, I wish the management and company were more supportive of their staff."
good,"great environment "
good,"Never gets too boring, there's always something to do. Definitely not the best place to work, but far from the worst. As long as you work at a steady space, and keep that customer welcoming smile on a swivel you'll do fine."
good,"I came into bookselling before the digital age and it is a night and day difference between when I started and when I left. It was a very close knit community early on until the family that owned barnes, sold majority to investors. It promptly went from caring deeply for its employees and rights to not so much. Very washed out corperate mentality. But good recourse to move up within the ranks to a certain degree"
good,Easy to schedule around other jobs or activities going on in your life. Nice management who can competently do their jobs. Wages could be a little better though.
good,"I honestly worked there at a time when the store manager was NOT a good manager. The other managers were fine, and the people I worked with were great...but the work gets stressful the higher you move up and the holidays are murder. But it's a good first job to have, especially if you like to read and want to develop your customer service skills."
good,Fun workplace. Had opportunity for job growth and learning new skills and possibly a new or different position depending on the opportunities available.
good,"Barnes & Noble has been pretty great to work for, friendly coworkers that quickly became part of my out of work group, and mostly great managers that want nothing but the best for you. How ever there are one or two managers who let the position go to there head at my store."
good,"I enjoyed working at Barnes and Noble. It was a very fun environment and the people were amazing. Some days were a lot more stressful than others, but that's a job right"
good,"The company is a great place to work if you are a self-starter who takes initiative and loves books. A shift can be at any location from the cashier to working in café or receiving and the hours are flexible. "
good,Varies between being boring and stressful.  A lot of pressure to sell member cards and collect emails from customers.  Fun people but can be kind of soul sucking.
good,One of the best bookstores to work for. A very literary culture with a lot of events scheduled to coincide with things going on in the community and country. Some author book signings and visits. The most fun job to work in.
good,"The people are all great. However, the pay and benefits just don't match the hard work that is put in daily. Closing shifts are often elongated and there are big rushes that come in."
good,"In general the working environment seems to differ from store to store. My store is constantly in chaos and pays little attention to the cafe, though the cafe manager is great. The cafe independently is great to work in, and other stores appear to treat their baristas and servers just as well as their booksellers."
good,"When I first started at Barnes & Noble as a part-time Bookseller, I was happy to have the work and enjoyed the job, the environment, and the hours I was getting. As the years went by however, I slowly became more and more disappointed with my hours, my pay, and the new management and company policies. While management issues are for the most part specific to my store, newer nationwide company policies have made it difficult for me to enjoy my time there. I am currently more than ready to move on from a place I once thought I could never easily leave."
good,"Retail environment, only closed on Thanksgiving and Christmas day. Good benefits for full time employees. Flexible schedule. Great discount on products."
good,"I only had a part time position, but you gain a lot of experience being moved from each section around the store. You start working in the Cafe, then at the Cashier's Desk, then Customer Service, then in the Shipping/Receiving area of the store and the Music Department. It gives you a more rounded training when you move to several areas than stay in the same place."
good,"I work at a Barnes & Noble cafe at a college so our work day was usually very busy and I learned a lot about making Starbuck's drinks, but I was only paid minimum wage with no chance of a raise unless prompted. This troubled me and was my main reason for finding a new job. I did enjoy working with the people I worked with and it was great for a first real job"
good,"Great place to work for as a college student, and the workplace was fun. Always some thing new and fun to work on and think about. Your coworkers are also vey agreeable and well-adjusted. It all comes down to clientele."
good,"Working for Barnes and Noble was fun. I love books and selling them to people was very fun. There was a surprising amount of drama within the management but if you don't mind retail, I would recommend working here."
good,"Working here was fantastic. For booksellers, typical day was to assist around the store doing tasks including cashier, assist with buyers, inventory, and more."
good,"It was always busy but that was great, and co-workers were great to work with, completed projects together. Hardest thing was not reaching the goal for the day."
good,"Overall, It was a great work environment and convenient since the bookstore was located on campus. I didn't have to worry about commuting or showing up late."
good,Barnes & Noble has created a culture conducive to a good work/life balance. The compensation is low and there is little room for advancement. The managers are very personable and genuinely care for employees. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people. A typical day at work for my position involves completing tasks that are due for that day and overseeing the store if I am scheduled as the manager on duty.
good,"Coworkers are awesome, customers are hit and miss. Overall work place is great, holidays can be really rough though but the discount on food and books is great."
good,"It was very nice to interact with different customers and also fun to make lattes/food. Management in the cafe is great. The store overall was a very relaxing and laid back place to not only work but also dine in/hang out and read. "
good,My schedule was flexible and the people there were fun to work with.  I learned a lot about Red Rocks while working at the book store! The manager was great and worked around any class.
good,Barnes and Noble provided me with an opportunity to develop my customer service skills in a enjoyable environment. I worked with so many wonderful coworkers.
good,"Most weekdays are easy pace (faster on weekends) so you must be able to stay motivated to find multiple tasks to keep busy, and very customer service orientated."
good,"Overall a good place to work. However, hours are unpredictable and if you are part time, hours are scarce. The management was good but managers had very different styles."
good,"A hectic first week when the school semester starts, then tapers off from there. Need good communication skills in order to find exactly what the students need, as well as patience from those who are outraged at the prices."
good,"It's retail."
good,"I don't have much to say about the job. From the two weeks I worked there it seemed like a good, clean environment with friendly co-workers and management. Speaking of management, the supervisors seemed to know what they were doing and were pretty reasonable. The training could have been much better and they shouldn't expect too much from you in a short amount of time but over all it was a pretty alright place to work."
good,"I started as Seasonal Help during the Christmas season.  I found it really easy to get a stop as a regular worker.  It's a fun and great job if you like books, movies, and or music.  The work itself is pretty simple too.  After the landing a part time position I was promoted quickly to a full time Lead.  The only drawback was the Store Manager was sexually harassing employees.  Upper management, the DM & RM refused to acknowledge the problem, which continued to spiral out of control.  It could have been a great job, but unfortunately, for my branch, it wasn't."
good,part of a 5 man management team. as a team member responsibilities for me included café operations along with marketing partnerships throughout the community
good,"A typical day at work for me would be behind the cash register, a 15 minute break, organizing magazines, and th end. I learned how to be extremley organized, people schools, friendliness, customer service, and much more. The managers there are somewhat rude at some points except for two of them. It's hard to understand when they are being friendly or just being rude, but trying to hide it. I really don't speak to any of my co-workers anymore, because they don't give out any hours, but the ones that I have spoken to are nice! The ones that I have become friends with have a lot of things in common with me, but I still discover new things from them. I have become extremley close with some that they have even come to support me in certain perfomances that I have done. Sometimes I'm treated as a child by some of my co-workers, because I'm under 28 and look young, it is very irritating especially when I have been working there longer than the both of them. They speak down to me at some point, but I don't have to deal with them as much anymore since I lack hours. The hardest part of the job has to be dealing with rude customers at some points of the day, but it's all part of the learning experience and I am somewhat glad that I encounter these customers so I can learn how to handle these situations. The most enjoyable part of the job is organizing things. I love to organize things and look at the cleanliness of things. I love to help others out when they need to find a book. I love offering anything I can do to help the customers, and it really is good for the soul."
good,"As a part-time side gig, Barnes & Noble is a great place to work for book lovers. Getting to know what customers are looking for and are interested in, as well as getting to recommend personal favorites, all the while enjoying a nice employee discount for yourself. Barnes & Noble also works to let employees know that they're appreciated, while encouraging a positive teamwork atmosphere, and accountability even if things go sour."
good,"Everyday i went to work with joy and excitement because i knew i would be able to help a lot of people,i have learned a lot of things from my co-workers and my manager,since that was my first time working in the US,a dynamic enviroment."
good,"The job has many regular customers that make the environment feel closer to that of a small town, than a large brick and mortar."
good,"Certain times of the year, you just watched the clock move as there was not much going on but the co-workers were great as they were all students. Getting hours outside of peak times were difficult. Favoritism was played by management in my opinion"
good,"An average day at B&N for a receiving manager consists of a lot of card board. You are in charge of balancing out the constant flow of books coming in and going out and keeping everything running smoothly, effectively, and accurately. The customer interaction level quickly decreases with this job position which is rare for a retail job. Hours are 7-3 for the most part and you do get weekends off which is a huge bonus. Management here is were most of the hard work gets involved. keeping the staff on task from the back room can be challenging so you need to be able to work well with the other managers to keep things running."
good,Relatively low stress job. The pay just isn't nearly worth the less stress that you do encounter. The other employees are great people.
good,"Great place to work if it is not your soul source of income. Full time jobs are few and far between, and part timers have few hours available to them. Great co-workers, mostly great customers. Management is mostly great across the board. Store managers are under pressure for certain statistics that have them boring down on their employees, but this will happen anywhere in retail. The hardest part of the job is keeping up the membership card sales, this is one of the biggest pressures on the employees and one of the hardest expectations to meet. The most enjoyable part of the job is being surrounded by people that love books, we are simply a different breed."
good,Very friendly atmosphere with great team building skills. Though also helpful in creating strong dependent skills. Fun work environment and programs that tied the community to the brand was a very nice perk to working there.
good,"For a CBDM there is no ""typical"" day at work.  The hardest part of the job is also what makes it the most fun, the varied demands of the day.  It is critical to be able to prioritize, but also be flexible enough to shift and regroup when necessary."
good,Barnes and Noble was a great place to work. I worked here while I was going to school and management was always extremely accommodating when it came to scheduling. The people here were wonderful to work with and every shift was always one spent having fun while being productive. Barnes and Noble was a really complex work environment that provided a lot of learning experiences.
good,Working at Barnes & Noble helped me grow as a manager. I learned to work with all types of personalities some good some not so much. I Learned to judge people by their work ethic.
good,"I enjoyed being able to serve customers and make sure they were really happy when they walked away from my counter. I made a point to have my guests try their drinks before walking away, and if they weren't happy, i would fix it, or remake it. Some guests came to our cafe not knowing what they wanted, or having never tried a beverage from a cafe. My job was to figure out what they wanted, create it, and make sure they were able to order it wherever they went. I enjoyed baking, and creating new products. I was able to order and receive what we needed, and to keep the cafe running even when things stopped working. You never knew what you were going to do, or who you were gonna meet during your day, and that is what made it fun."
good,"I sell text books to other students mainly during the first few weeks of classes.  Now I am a cashier for commodities.  Business is really slow.  I was told there is advancement, but I do not know how yet."
good,"With my cashiering position, I was responsible for a lot of tasks. From cleaning the entire front end, opening the store, management of online orders, transaction management, to display assembly and restocking. We were also required to fill in-store orders. Over all, the position was very stressful and I felt that the title ""cashier"" was minimizing the actual responsibilities of the job. Management was always in a bright mood and usually helpful, although sometimes absent during rushes or dire situations. Coworkers were usually knowledgeable, but the store also hired around 200 new workers every six months which made having experienced workers rare, and that put a lot more stress on the seasoned employees."
good,"I Showed up at whatever location was provided"
good,unpacking book. able to see whats new and what could be interesting
good,was a easy pace job. just made coffe roducts and keept food stocked. nice enviorment.
good,Barnes & Noble is a company that excels in it's field because of hard working employees who do well to make customer's feel valued.
good,"It was a fun place to work that helped me improve many of my own abilities, while making some reliable friends."
good,"If you love reading or researching anything, I'd highly recommend working at a bookstore for at least some period of your life. Not only are there new releases weekly, book signings monthly, as well as discounts to be had, this can be a high paced work environment. I can say there will be days where you will not be asked the same question twice. Perfect part-time job!"
good,Really good insurance benefits though advancement was nearly impossible.  Overall a pretty good company to work for--they definitely recognized positive outcomes from their employees.
good,On a typical day I check E-Planner for upcoming projects for the day. These include setting up endcaps and tables and displays. Then check in receiving for our daily deliveries of product. Help with cafe if needed with the morning rush and cashier as needed and do returns. Shelve the daily product deliveries until the mid person comes in and then takes over what was left.
good,"A typical day at work is fast-paced and always busy. There is always something to be done, cleaned, or a customer to be served. I learned that working at Barnes & Noble Cafe you have to have great customer service skills in order to completely satisfy customers. Management is great; they work with your schedule and are very understanding. The hardest part of the job is not having enough workers on certain shifts. The weekends are our busiest days of the week and it can get pretty hectic and not having enough workers can sometimes put a strain on others such as the customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is customers. They always make the experience worthwhile."
good,"I love books and I love coffee, so dealing with both was good for me."
good,I enjoyed working with the students and professors.  We were a satellite store and didn't have much communication with the main campus in Durham which caused a bit of difficulty.
good,Very busy and knowledgeable workplace. On your feet for the entire shift. Stocking and Selling books and miscellaneous merchandise. Assisting with new stock at the loading area. Taking phone calls throughout the day from customers. Handling book orders (ordering books on site for customers).
good,Upper management was uninterested in new or innovative ideas. Limited influence and inattentive to issues. 
good,A typical day ensures you help the customer get the book they want.  This either by placing it in their hand or by ordering it to the store or their home.  
good,"customers are the best. They are friendly and loyal customers."
good,"Over the last weeks of the summer, I worked for my school's Barnes & Noble. Great decision and I picked up a lot of experience in retail"
good,"Check-in with the supervisor or review his check list. During the course of the day work on check list as well as cashiering, assisting customers locating their selections, placing special orders and answering the phone."
good,A typical day at work is slow paced. I have learned a great number of customer service skills and organizational skills. Management is consistent with promoting a awesome work place. The hardest part of the job is keeping busy .
good,Personally assisted at least 40 customers each 8-hour shift.
good,"While no longer in its heyday, a Barnes & Noble College Bookstore job is truly an education in itself. It was my first real job and I was still in school at the time. I began as a temp, part time for the back to school rush. I was kept on and eventually made full time. There were no easy days during rush. It was best customer service at a frenzied pace, but the day flew by. I grew up a lot there and in doing so was rewarded with my first supervisory position. I am still close with so many of my co-workers there, from the regular staff as well as fellow supervisors and managers. The hardest part is just keeping that good service coming because customers can and will be very difficult and contrary. Occasionally, though you get into nice conversations with some and you might actually learn something in the bargain. Store events are another fun part of the job. Overall, I would recommend it, especially if you're a student or avid reader and could use that employee discount!"
good,"Typical retail environment, amazing store manager and community outreach."
good,Part-time job This business encourages the reading of books. They have lots of special activities on site for their customers that they encourage their employees to participate in or run. Their break room was always clean and the staff was helpful and friendly. Did include late hours and working on holidays.
good,"Shifts are typically about 8 hours, and will usually include either open or close duties. All co-workers very cool and fun to work with. Management helpful, but very busy. It can get very busy, and coffee customers can sometimes be very rude, but usually it is paced so that the day moves quickly and is not overly stressful."
good,"It has been an steady job and the company provided for very good benefits, especially health insurance."
good,"Loved working here till they made me, without consent, start to work in the Starbucks and were unwilling to negotiate moving me back to the bookseller position"
good,My experience with Barnes & Nobles may not have been the best. Over the course of 4 years management changed approximately 6 times.
good,"My years working with Barnes and Noble have given me a broad and diverse skill set. As you will read in my resume, I do everything from open and close the store, to interviewing, hiring and training, to dealing with maintenance issues. I enjoy being challenged and I am a great problem solver, and working for Barnes and Noble gives me both on a daily basis. I work with an amazing group of managers, probably one of the best I've ever worked with. What I like most about the job, as I stated previously, is that I enjoy being challenged, coming up with new ideas, finding solutions to age old problems, and working with customers, many of which we see multiple times per week. The most difficult part of the job, and the reason I am currently seeking other employment, is that the growth of the company itself is in jeopardy. With the whole country going digital, the lifespan of brick and mortar bookstores is decreasing at a rapid pace. I no longer feel secure in my job, and I don't see long term opportunities for me where I currently am. That being said, there also isn't any opportunity for advancement for me even within my store. The store manager has been with the company for 20+ years and won't be leaving anytime soon. I am looking for a position with a company that can offer me potential growth and advancement."
good,"I’ve worked here for a little over a year, and I really enjoyed it for the first few months. After awhile, managers will expect highly of you while making you do more than your work load for low pay. Part time pay, full time hours."
good,Overall is a great place to work for it’s far better then most retailers. It has been my experience that Barnes&Noble offers competitive pay. An offer support to employees to help with advancement in your career if that is what you want.
good,"I guess the manager or schedule person at my location just didn't seem to understand how to set a payroll and schedule enough help in the cafe? I mean, it's a wonderful place to work and I still count being a barista here as my favorite job. I just sometimes didn't feel valued since I was the one to always have my hours cut and it took them almost 2 months after being hired to put me on the schedule. I love the place, just not the management."
good,"I greatly enjoy being around my coworkers, the employee discount is great and my managers are kind, however I feel the pay is not enough for the demands of the job and the scheduling is unpredictable and likely to change the day before a shift without anyone informing you beforehand"
good,"Spent 23 years there.  Lots of changes took place.  "
good,"Great job for all the features and benefits. They work their people, though, there is no honeymoon period. Peers are the best. Management from a woman’s perspective is too heavy with male styles.  They are transitioning a lot of practices, lots of wrinkles for the next little while; benefiting in the long run."
good,"Very relaxing environment , especially if you love coffee or reading. The customers build relationships with you and you feel a sense of ease. I had relatively good management, and the pay wasn’t poor. I would recommend this job ."
good,"Overall, B&N can be an excellent place to work.  Most managers are willing to provide a safe and nurturing work environment, though, as in any business, there are exceptions. Most of the customers are destination shoppers looking for your guidance in finding a great book or new author, and really appreciate your help.  Scheduling flexibility can be an issue, but that is the nature of retail, so this should come as no surprise."
good,"It was a quaint job. Easy for beginners other than the really tedious baking system. Unfortunately they only pay 9.50, regardless of past pay, which is not nearly enough for anyone to support themselves. Management was very kind and wanted to work with me every step of the way. If they paid more I’d probably still be an employee!"
good,I had a great experience working there.  My managers and coworkers were friendly and great to work with at my store.  Pay is pretty low and it can be dead at times.
good,"laid back, quiet, homey, cozy, easy to get lost in there. it was honestly a great job, management was so so but the people were great and so were most of the customers"
good,"Worked in IL for great team/No offers for FT, flexible hours, min wage,praised as key cashier for client relations, loved ambiance of job and team spirit and love book recommendations and service to clients. Layed off due to slow business when internet sales were influencing store traffic."
good,I loved working there if yhey had given me more hours and more pay or offered me full time I would've stayed. I would love to do it again if they would offer full time and advancement.
good,"Barnes & Noble, if you like books, is a great place to work. You get a pretty good discount, you're eligible for PTO even as at part time, and as a bookseller, your job description is basically ""talk up your favorite books to anyone who will listen"" which is a fun way to spend your time. However, there is a lot of unnecessary pressure put on employees by way of secret shoppers and very high goals"
good,"The company is in a period of transition, hopefully for the best.  Right now they are micro-managing payroll and other metrics.  The new CEO hasn't taken over yet, so we will see if he changes this current path of action."
good,"A bookstore attracts people who enjoy books, so employees and customers are mostly pleasant to work with. Truly a low-stress job. However, unless you are interested in moving into management, you will not get full-time hours or benefits."
good,"I had to leave, because I needed more pay, but the job was wonderful. The environment was great. Management cared. You knew your objectives, and the celebrated victories."
good,Barnes and noble is a great  company to work for. The pace is often fast but it's always manageable and if you are going to be selling something it might as well be something that improves society (books).
good,"I worked at a high-volume store, which meant we where often very busy.  For the most part, I enjoyed working there, but, being a part-time retail job, pay was low.  However, when I worked there, I did get benefits, including health, dental, and vision insurance, which is very rare for part-time retail."
good,"Dress code is very relaxed and the company is more concerned with the effort and amount of work put in than anything else. If you follow the rules and do your job correctly, you will be noticed and rewarded."
good,Open store clock in.  Write daily activity schedule for employees scheduled to work that day. Open safe prepare tills for daily activity.Merchandise whether first shift or mid shift. Closing shift ensure floor was cleaned and organized for next day activity.  Count down till balance shift.
good,My cafe manager was amazing but the store manager was very disorganized and didn't care very much about the cafe side of the store. I learned a lot of skills there but it was a little too fastpaced and stressful for me.
good,"I enjoyed recommending/sharing books with people and helping them find things. Hardest thing was having to help someone who had no real information on what it is they want ie: ""it has a blue cover""."
good,"no surprises here. its exactly what you'd expect. good coworkers. good managers. you wont get paid much and the hours arent ideal, but its the best job in retail."
good,Placed and received orders .. Called distributors and customers. Shelved merchandise even dressed as character a to do events for children. I also placed merchandise on display and coordinate some events
good,"This was a great job, but it's not enough to live off of. Very few people are hired full time, so you probably won't get any benefits. The job is fun, and you meet great people, but it's not much money."
good,"Other than poor pay that is across the board in the retail industry, this is an excellent place to work.  Good atmosphere.  Good place to work for discounted merchantise"
good,"Thanks to the management team I learned how to manage multiple tasks throughout a work day.  I also gained experience in dealing with many kinds of people, co-workers and customers both.  The job was never terribly difficult but the Rush periods did bring a fair amount of stress."
good,Doesn't have enough hours. The discounts are very nice. There are several managers some are nice others are questionable not. very fast paced training.
good,"Generally this is a good company.  Management will vary from store to store, but you can expect good managers overall.  The company prefers to promote from within and will transfer between stores.  This is a SELLING culture.  You are expect to sell product and services.  This is a retail business.  Expect to work weekends, evenings and holidays."
good,I learned how to multi-task really quickly at Barnes & Nobles as a bookseller. I learned how to use a cash register and ship in and out book orders and etc.
good,"I enjoyed a very good career at Barnes & Noble. I loved the culture of the retail book world. I had a great team at my store. However, there are not many opportunities to move up in the company because people love their jobs and don’t leave. I also feel that the pay isn’t competitive compared to other retail. Overall it has been my favorite career path and I still love visiting my old stores."
good,"As far as retail jobs go, B&N is one of the best. If you love reading, talking about books, being around book lovers, etc., it's a great place to spend a day."
good,Barnes and Noble is a nice place to work. The people are fun and it is a very team oriented place. It is a fast-paced environment and you have to work well under pressure.
good,"When I started, most of the employees had been there 8 or more years.  Now that I'm down to part-time, all except 4 have left or retired.  The company focus changed so strenuously to ""sell memberships"" instead of ""sell books"" that it became less and less comfortable to work there.  Knowing the contents of books, knowing the layout of the store, knowing how to research for customers on the computer, knowing how to ring up sales:  all became secondary to our ability to talk people into paying for a membership.  "
good,"I had a fantastic experience during my time. The only negative aspect of the job was the pay, just over minimum wage, so when the opportunity to change back to my primary career opened, I took it posthaste."
good,"B&N is a good place to work if you don't intend to be there permanently. The corporate side is making poor decisions for the company resulting in people quitting. There are good managers at the store level but most are on the lower tier of management. Higher level managers are not good at their jobs, and some don't even do their jobs. They just sit in the office and let their employees handling everything out on the sales floor."
good,"It was an enjoyable experience. Staff were friendly, Managers were competent, and the overall work culture was instructive and efficient. I would recommend this job to anyone who enjoys shelving, selling, or discussing books."
good,"not too many hours, most weeks i did less that 15 hours total and when i did work it was either very slow paced or non-stop chaotic customers. But overall I enjoyed the experience the people I worked with were pleasant."
good,"I enjoyed every minute of working here, the perks were great and staff were so fun to work with but just never enough hours scheduled. It was hard making a living and paying bills on $9 and hour and only 20 hours a week"
good,"How do I sum up 17 years? There have been *lots* of changes, especially since 2014. I will keep this simple—If you need to make a little extra money and want to work with genuinely great people in a more relaxed retail atmosphere, work at Barnes and Noble. I've been a former employee for over a year, and I still keep in touch with just about everyone I worked with at my store over my 17 years there."
good,It was a great place to work some days it was really fast paced and you had to help a bunch of people with books and some days it was ver dead. It was a good balance but a temporary job.
good,"Great atmosphere and place to work. However, the digital age is catching up and it is felt in cuts and changes that corporate must make. Towards the end there was much disorganization and increased push to sell memberships and the like."
good,"A typical day at work was pretty busy; there is always something to do. Whether it's helping customers or cleaning or preparing the food, there is almost always something that needs to be done. Coworkers are by far the best part of the job."
good,"Not a career, but somewhere to broaden your views of customer services. Atmosphere is great, especially if you're a book lover, and love the cafe."
good,"If you are part detective, mind reader and customer service oriented, this could be a good fit for you.  You will wear a variety of hats; sometimes you might cashier, other times you will work customer service, shelving stock, or reorganizing stock, the job changes hourly which makes it fast paced and fun.  Great benefits, including a generous employee discount, paid vacations, and healthcare."
good,when you first start is really difficult to get past the cafe manager because she's kind of aggressive but once you get use to her and start to get the hang of things its fine.
good,"Working at B&N can be a lot of fun and challenging,  Helping customers find the right match for their needs is always a great feeling.  Can be stressful at times when the tools needed for great customer service are not available but the team work between the co-workers makes up for that.  The Management is for the most part pretty good.  They try to work with you and adjust schedules if needed."
good,I liked working for this company but the upper management was not the best because of lack of commitment to employees. I felt undervalued at times by the upper management.
good,"nice place to work for a first time or second job. Relaxed atmosphere, educational environment, topical news and current trends wrere followed. Good benefits"
good,I enjoyed my time with Barnes & Noble. The employees and environment were very enjoyable. If my position hadn't been eliminated I would still be there.
good,"The coworkers are usually amazing people but the benefits are few. You do get 30-50% off on stuff, which is nice. But the low pay isn't worth the eight hours on your feet. Recently Barnes and Noble has taken to removing full-time positions, or at least leaving them unfilled. We don't have a cafe lead or a receiving person anymore, and we haven't been given the okay to actually fill the positions with someone else."
good,Perfect job for my college lifestyle. Very flexible with classes and breaks and theatre rehearsals. I would highly recommend this job to any other college students looking for work.
good,I loved working and managing the music/movie department. I developed friendly relationships with my regular customers. I love the culture of book stores.
good,"While it can be fun to work here at times, the environment is very fast paced. Especially when you are working in the kids / Toys and Games department."
good,"This is definitely a job for someone who likes books, and only for someone who likes books. You are expected (by the customers, not the management) to have read every book that Barnes & Noble sells. The pay is not great, so you have to be there for the love of literature, and nothing else."
good,"Decent first job for a college student to have during or just after undergrad. Flexible scheduling, but very little opportunity to climb up in pay or title."
good,"Excellent training, good communication from managers, and lots of interesting fellow employees and customers. Plus books and other cool stuff at a 30% discount. I'd stay here indefinitely, but the money is laughable. It's a great, flexible job for college kids. "
good,"Working in the DVD/Movie department in B&N consisted of organizing movies and DVD's in their appropriate genres and row. Great customer service was key in keeping customers interested in the product you are trying to sell. I enjoyed working for the management at B&N, they made the work experience nice. The hardest part of the job was having the patience to sort hundreds of DVDs back into their location, but the most enjoyable part of working for B&N was utilizing their discounts."
good,"I found my experience to be a good one and would recommend working in the cafe for any first time worker."
good,"I loved this job a LOT. I had a lot of fun working at Barnes & Noble, but the store manager that took over shortly after I started was utterly awful. She was the WORST. I was determined to out-live her at the company, and I did, so once we got a new store manager, I was out. Great coworkers, great customers, great experience."
good,"There aren't many benefits and the pay is really low, but if you are a college student its adequate pay. It is enough to get you some food, but not enough to pay your bills."
good,"Most days are spent working either at the cashwrap or on the sales floor. Cashiers are required to pitch the Membership program to all customers and request email addresses. Working on the sales floor mostly consists of helping customers, general store upkeep, and helping put out product."
good,"I enjoy working at B&N and always have. However, it has recently become apparent that there may not be any room for me to advance and therefore, I have decided that it may be more beneficial for me to move on."
good,liked working the morning easy to get in and get out have the rest of the day to yourself. around noon it always got hectic no matter what day it was. Thats what makes the time go by pretty fast
good,Typical retail job but it's books - day to day customer service stuff. Good discount and some ability to check out books like a library. best part books worst part minimal hours unless you're management
good,Working at Barnes and Noble was an enjoyable experience. The people were great and working with the public was challenging. I enjoyed helping the customers.
good,Stepped into work and could see how the day was from just looking around. I learned to manage my time by working around other tasks and juggling as many tasks as possible.
good,"Working as a bookseller/ the head of the Children's department was challenging at times but, very enjoyable.  It was a fast paced work place but, as long as you were trained well, there were not any problems."
good,"Like I said in the summary it was fast paced and working in the cafe they always had us understaffed. I ran the department by myself when I worked and at times made it extremely stressful. But the people I worked with outside of my department and in it when there was an overlap were outstanding. Great work enviorment, and job once I got my bearings; sad I had to leave."
good,great place to work high energy multi tasking fast pace but if you need higher pay there is no negotiations . outside applicants make more than internal which brings hostile work enviorment with the vets
good,Occasionally fast paced work environment. Great atmosphere with the customers and the other employees. Could have better management and more employees.
good,"Barnes and Noble can be a really great place to work. Only their improvements don't always help the staff, and can sometimes make it harder or worse. While they say they want their goal to be customer service, sometimes it feels like they care more about money then customer service or employees."
good,"I worked with a great manager so my experience at B&N was also great. Depending on my shift I opened the store, set up the mixes and syrups for the day, cleaned dishes, took customer orders and handles the cash register, re-stocked items, made drinks, made food, mopped floors, cleaned cafe area during closing time, etc."
good,"Interaction with customers: receiving orders, processing sales and monies, and managing customer issues. Training and motivating team members. Preparation of products, maintaining quality of product, Monitoring all service equipment. Uncompromising standards in maintaining a clean and safe work environment (per Labor Board and OSHA regulations and Company standards). Champions recognition and motivation efforts Preparing/making/transporting deposits, preparing proposed labor schedules, product projections, financials for store manager’s review/approval."
good,"Barnes and noble is overall a very fun work place except it is a job you want when you already have a full time job/ are in school or just looking to make a little extra cash. Hours may vary and managers can/will work around your schedule. Friendly employees/employers, almost like family. "
good,Working among books is a lot of fun. The fellow employees and management are nice and enjoyable as well. Working part-time there aren't a lot of hours which can be frustrating sometimes.
good,"A typical day of work is a little slow most of the time being in a rough location. However, a regular day is usually very relaxed and not too hectic, I do not mind being at work or going to work at all. However, the work times should be changed because it is a college environment and most of the hours that we are open there are not many customers that come in and in the weekend, it is useless to be open at certain times. That would be the most annoying part of the job in my opinion."
good,"If you love to read, then this is the place to be.  Barnes and Noble has a great selection of books.  Customer service is high priority.  Getting the book into the customers hand is very important to the Virginia Beach Town Center Barnes and Noble Booksellers.  We will go the extra mile to ensure the customer gets what they are looking for."
good,"Working warehouse for the company was probably the best seasonal job I've had in years, but there was no chance for advancement and no opportunities to apply for other positions once the season closed. Management was fair. The workload was expected for the holiday time, and the work environment was pleasant."
good,"Typical days are leisurely spent either making drinks and serving customers tasty baked cookies, reorganizing shelves, and hunting down books for customers and lost PDT's( devices that scan books bar codes.)"
good,"Work days vary on the time of year, day of the week, and the time of the day. Certain times can be more stressful than others but the people make it fun. The hardest part of the job, especially as a part-time worker who only works a few days of the week, is keeping up with all the changes around the store. You have to know what endcaps and tables exist and what each one promotes. Usually all displays and promotions are switched around on a weekly and monthly basis. Working there, you get the experience of meeting all sorts of new people on a regular basis as well as the regulars."
good,"If you don't mind constant work, this is for you! Lots of young people work here, which makes things exciting. You get discounts throughout the store as well."
good,"The culture made work a pleasure. Working as a team, with a mutual sense of respect, made even the most difficult requests easy to deal with. Everyone also shares appreciation for their work; making them both passionate and knowledgeable."
good,Loved the job. learned alot from it. Enjoyedn books and learning different things also . Enjoyed helping customers with finding books they needed. Loved working there
good,"Daily pressure to sell memberships, but cool characters in staff and customers that shop. Lots of slow time except during holidays and unless you dislike books, the job itself is never too difficult."
good,Constant employee perks and rewards for hard work. They can at times take things a little too seriously. Some of the managers and employees may gossip a little too much. Its an overall friendly and nice environment
good,"I worked at two very different locations and I was cross trained in all departments. I learned how to be a valuable part of the team, quick thinking, and respectful to customers when it is most difficult. This was a fantastic place to work because everyone was very like minded and friendly. I try and bring my enthusiasm for such a cohesive work environment to my future workplace. The hardest part was may wages, but being young with no job history it is understandable. The best part was the discounts and the people I met while working there/."
good,Barnes and Noble has managed to create a positive working environment in their stores.  They provide phenomenal employee benefits and great health care packages.
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed my time at B&N. Everyone who works there is friendly and glad to help you learn the ins and outs of the job. There were not many employee benefits aside from paid time off, and management overall could have done a bit better as far as organization, etc. But overall, I highly recommend working here!"
good,"If you're a book buff, then this is a great place to work. Hours are limited, so don't depend on it for your only source of income. There's a great atmosphere and staff for the most part, but high turn over because of minimum wage and high stress. Better love pushing sells at ALL times if you work here."
good,"Customer service is first and foremost at this retailer, as with most. You learn a great deal about how to deal with people. Management is available to hear your complaints and help to the best of their ability. The workplace has a friendly environment, but of course you must get your work done. The hardest part is dealing with customers when they are being difficult. The most enjoyable is being able to talk about and help customers with things are you are passionate about."
good,I would love to come to work because I would always expect a very relaxing day. Projects were always fun to work on and helping customers was always great because they were always so thankful for our help.
good,"The day is usually fast-paced since being a bookseller means flitting in between customer service, working on personal projects for the store or shelving, and cashiering. Customers seem to come in waves so it's very busy on and off again. There's always something that needs to be done."
good,"I have always enjoyed working for Barnes&Noble.  What I don't like is they typically don't hire from within, so you can stay stuck at a dead end job for a very long time. I would recommend them as a starting job or as reliable part time work."
good,"I loved this job and would have worked there forever....if there was any hope of a living wage. Unfortunately the pay is very low and the turn over is very high. "
good,I learned to evolve my people skills while also building work experience with a good group of people. This is a great place to work for those tying to balance a full school schedule while working.
good,Many of the people I work with were very nice and welcoming. Most days were very busy. If our going to work at any Branes and Nobles branch I recommend comfortable walking shoes. You will be stand for usually over 7 hours straight.
good,"Working at Barnes & Noble taught me a great amount of customer services, sales, & marketing. I was able to serve students and families with their educational needs."
good,"Typical day at work was helping customers find what they needed with very diverse interests.  I would perform zone maintenance making sure all products were where they were supposed to be along with receiving and and placing inventory.  I learned much about customer service and inventory as well as working with a team and the entire process performed in a retail store (receiving and preparing inventory, customer service, cashiering, etc.)"
good,"Barnes&Noble values their employees and provides a pleasant place to work. Although their can be small problems with management, there are normally enough managers to figure the problem out. When customer traffic is heavy, I have never had a problem receiving help when needed."
good,Great work environment. Needs better benefits and further room for full time positions at location. The hourly wage for booksellers and supervisor roles are horrendous. Other companies pay supervisors above $11 dollars an hour. B&N pays their supervisors $9.
good,"I love the overall experience here at Barnes&Nobles. The customers are great and the employees but, there is not too much money for payroll so, I barely make hours. Management is a little corrupted but, I could manger. I have learned some management skills and how to be a bit more friendly oriented."
good,I love the job.  I love what we sell.  I wish the company was stronger in the market place.  I can do much more than they expect of me.
good,The work environment was wonderful. My coworkers were fantastic. I loved how involved the management team was! They set up games and we would all stay late to play! It was definitely a family environment and it was also a great place to escape too. They gave me lots of hours and I got paid weekly. I would volunteer to stay as often as I could. Great place. Wish I hadn't been seasonal!
good,"Seriously, this is the third time you have asked for this. Great place to work. Previous management had a problem with giving breaks as needed. New management now. I hope they are doing what needs to be done."
good,Shelving books and inventory on a daily. Meet new people help them find the book they seek. Always in touch with management since they're hands on. Co-workers are a good bunch not starting any trouble and work together. Hardest part was sometimes being on foot most of the day but enjoyed most of the work.
good,"Usually the days were fun and educational. The learning curve to figure out all the drinks and food and learning to multitask was steep but it was very fun and exciting to learn everything in the fast paced environment. I truly enjoyed working there, surrounded by books and the smells of food and lattes. Most of the employees and managers were also very friendly and nice. "
good,"My manager was without a doubt the best part of this job. She was involved, considerate and very fair. A fantastic boss! And many of my coworkers were patient and kind when training me."
good,"I'm a part time worker. A normal work day would be restocking the shelves, help students get the right books for the classes. Co-workers are really helpful, there is a positive working environment."
good,"Most people who love books want to  share their love of books by talking about them.  This is the most effective way of selling, talking about the things you love."
good,I have to say that working here helped me be super fast and efficient. This was also the first job where i had to deal with unhappy and rude customers. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with my co-workers and i became super close with them.
good,This is a great place to work if you're looking for part-time job to do while attending college or if you're looking for a second part-time job to earn a little extra money. The work environment it good. A plus to working at Barnes & Noble is getting to meet some of your favorite authors at the book signing events.
good,"I worked for two locations in my state and found, across the board, that staff members are amazing. Managers are often given challenges without support and training needed."
good,"Barnes and Noble has given me perspective on the different types of people that live within our community. It is wonderful to be in a workplace that encourages the constant strive towards knowledge. The Co-workers are a rare bread, coming from all walks of life. The dynamic of the staff allows for a unique and rewarding workplace experience. These people are most definitely the most enjoyable part of this job."
good,"Well, it's retail, but it's also books. Do not make the assumption that you get to lounge around reading all day. That's not how it works. You shelve in the mornings before the store opens, then you're scheduled for either Customer Service, Cash Register/Wrap Station, or Music. (Or Cafe, depending on your job.) Coworkers are generally awesome. Managers are also awesome. Customers are usually pretty awesome too. You get to recommend books to customers and become more familiar with what's popular or in demand. Definitely a good learning experience. Only comlaint is the minimum wage pay."
good,"starts minimum wage so its not a place where you will be rolling in it. But if you love books its great. Employees get 30% of books and have access to advanced copies. They also expect you to be a salesperson which is unbelievable since the pay doesn't warrant it. You have a goal of how many memberships you should be selling, you don't get fired over numbers but you will be talked to about it. (repeatedly)"
good,"This was a great company to work for while attending college.  It was on campus, so it was easily within walking distance of any classes.  Mangers worked well around school schedules and understood when something school related came up to interfere with a shift."
good,This is a great place to meet new people and very flexible to help along with completing school. The work day is full of helping others and suggesting books to others.
good,"Working at Barnes and Nobles was always interesting and fun as their Barista. I would say the only downfall was that I was hired to be the Cafe lead before their current one quit. He never left and I was stuck in the current position. I was trained to be a lead, so I got the great experience and was well trained by their managers which i truly appreciated."
good,"Its retail, so no set schedules and sometimes the customers were a bit to deal with but otherwise is a good company to work for.  I enjoyed the products and company culture.  pay was alright for retail."
good,"Come in prep the loading dock for deliveries. Learned how to process books, toys and items for stocking. Management is fair, informative and very helpful. Co-workers are the same like management, very helpful and informative. Seeing a customer or a co-worker having a hard time at the job. Most enjoyable part of the job is everything goes smoothly at work."
good,"If you love books, this is the place to work.  Lots of regular customers. Fun coworkers. Managers are great.  Pay isn't that great."
good,A typical day at work consisted of shelving books and maintaining the book floor. I learned a lot about Customer service. The management was efficient and my co-workers were great to be around. The hardest part of my job was trying to be in too many places at one time. The most enjoyable part of my job was working in an environment of education because I love reading.
good,Everyone working at Barnes and Noble loves the job for different reason. Some love comics and love getting to talk to costumers about past and future works. Everyone makes the work environment friendly and safe.
good,"During my time at Barnes and Noble, I spent my time as Childrens Lead.  My day would consist of checking freight for that day and reviewing any pending projects I might have had.  I was also responsible for delegating said projects to the other associates that worked in the department.  I also helped set up and maintain Educational Toys and Games."
good,"I worked here for four years and I loved it until the final year. The culture was amazing, and I loved interacting with my customers and coworkers. In the cafe, working in such close proximity to my coworkers created true friendships that I still value today. The biggest downside-pay. They often require employees to do jobs outside of their job title and getting a raise is almost impossible. When I was finally promoted to cafe lead and became full time, I was mistreated by management and asked to do most aspects of their job without a raise. I began to feel as if I my hard work was never good enough and the environment became miserable. I was pushed too far. Despite everything, I look back on my days at Barnes & Noble and I will never forget some of the valuable lessons I learned there."
good,"As a lead bookseller I was responsible for maintaining a particular department, keeping up with stock, ordering new stock. While doing all of this everyone was required to deliver top-notch customer service."
good,I worked mainly in back of the house processing shipment and merchandise but main focus was also helping with customer service on the sales floor.
good,"We constantly research and restock our bookshelves while we keep inventory on how many books remain unsold and performing great customer service . I have learned to cross-train and multi-task  from researching books and pulling orders from the internet to working the cashier, reporting online orders and buying books back from customers. I was given the lead on the part-time and temporary co-workers which I worked with usually two at a time training them on how to manage our bookstore. The hardest part of the job was the labor, basically having to move palettes of books from place to place  in a small warehouse but the best part of the job was creating a happy environment for our team and customers."
good,Nice place to work. Staff and customers are pleasant. In company advancement encouraged. Willingness to work with students around school schedules.
good,"Some store management teams are great, some are horrible. They don't pay their employees enough and they give you minimum hours unless you are full time which is rare unless you are a lead or have been there several years."
good,"On a daily basis, I am never sure what I am going to be doing before I arrive at work - much of the time I am working as a cashier, but I have also spent time working at the Information desk, maintaining the store, stocking the shelves, making sure new and/or popular titles are where customers can find them easily, or whatever else may be required of me. Management is willing to listen to any job-related problems I might have, and is always looking for new ways to train the employees on the floor. My co-workers are great to work alongside, and their experience has helped me immeasurably in my time as an employee. The hardest part of the job, for me, is when a customer wants a title that we should have, but due to it being sold already or simply being an unusual and hard-to-find title we can't provide; conversely, one of the most fulfilling parts of the job is being able to find exactly what a customer wants, put it in their hands, and watch their reaction."
good,"On a typical day, students come in to the bookstore to buy the books they need for their classes. First thing in the morning we would complete the online book orders, submit the purchase, and place the books in a box ready for pick-up. Throughout the day we would assist the students with finding the appropriate books needed. About around noon books we have ordered would arrive and we would place them in the appropriate location."
good,Everyday was similar to the day before. You had expectations of what the day would bring. The store was always busy and I enjoyed that. There was always something that needed to be done. Great communication throughout the store.
good,The environment and management were great. Just the people I worked with were hard to work with.
good,It is very productive and well verse organization in emphasizing good customers service. The my co-workers are friendly and will to help you in time of need
good,"This was my first job, and I really had enjoyed it. Since the bookstore was a college campus, a typical day during Rush Week (Which is the first week back in school) is really busy. With various students asking for their books and wondering what books they need, can be very busy. Since this was my first job, I had learned a lot of things; keeping an eye on various customers that come in and out of the store, working on making purchases for customers on the registers and simply, stocking various textbooks. During my time at the bookstore, I really enjoyed working alongside my manager and assistant Manager. They were fun to work with, and they made sure that everyone knew and understood on what to do; they made working there fun. The hardest part of the job was trying to get a clear understanding on what the International/ESL students were asking about books and what was needed for their classes; It was hard since they're first language wasn't english - so it took awhile for each of us to get an understanding. Just simply working at bookstore was enjoyable to me."
good,Barnes & Noble as a company in general was a honor to work for. Great company with great customer service in general just from a consumer aspect. It was a fun some time fast paced environment depending on the season. Awesome hands on training. A open opportunity to meet and great new faces and network. Fun and easy going co-workers that I still associate with today. All in all not a career but a great place to make stepping stones.
good,It is not the best of pay by any means and has very little room for growth. It is good for students and those that are retired and don't rely on the money. Good atmosphere. Many of my coworkers became my life long friends.
good,"Great relaxed work environment with the chance to work in different areas of the store, so you are not tied down to one area.  Coworkers and staff are knowledgeable and casual, and management is willing to work with other schedules."
good,Barnes and Noble was a great environment to work in and had great flexibility in the hours I could being a student. The only down side was even as a manager our pay was terrible.
good,"Great environment, friendly and customer service eccentric."
good,"This company has taught me how to balance your professional life with professional. You meet a variety of people, and learn how to interact with people of different backgrounds, beliefs, etc."
good,"A typical day for me starts with checking the orders that we have received from our website. This can range anywhere from textbooks to clothing merchandise. It is my job to make sure the right merchandise has been pulled for the orders and then I process the payments and send them to receiving. An important aspect of working at Barnes and Noble is team work. My tasks vary after that depending on what week we are in during the college's quarter. I work on shipment, checking textbooks and putting them with their proper courses. Towards the end of the quarter, the focus is shifted on returning the textbooks back to the publishers. This requires strong attention to detail. I have to make sure that the proper titles and the right amount of the books have been pulled, boxed and recorded. "
good,"typical day was waiting for calls from complaining customers and placing online orders for customers."
good,loved working there stayed for 12 years.  Concerned about the future of bookstores.
good,Barnes and Noble stresses customer service and interacting with every member to increase sales and customer satisfaction. I learned how to work as a team as well as in individual. My co-workers were cooperative and helped me to become a better bookseller. 
good,"Working in retail has taught me a lot. From how to work with a variety of people to helping upset and troubled customers, learning new computer systems, time management, how to effectively supervise groups and individuals, how to think creatively to get the job done. You have to be truly well rounded to succeed in this job, and a sense of humor helps too. All in all, Barnes & Noble has been a wonderful experience. "
good,"It has been a good almost 12 years.  I appreciated being able to locate from Sugar Land To Dallas when the need arose. I enjoy my job and as Music Manager, I get the opportunity to do it all. I have been actively working toward promotion for several years, knowing that the company would at some point eliminate my position and that is now occurring."
good,"Having worked for both Barnes and Noble and their now defunct sister company B. Dalton, I have to rate this company on average provides a very good working environment, good benefits, and a great employee discount system that is applied at all affiliated locations. However, the work environment under the current store manager at the Premier Center II location in Mandeville, Louisiana has broken down the feeling of family and teamwork that employees once had, utilizing constant threats of termination, demanding that employees watch each other and report any and all mistakes that are observed and if they are not reported then both employees will be brought in for disciplinary action, and she has made  it a practice to harass employees by building disciplinary reports over even the most trivial things so that she can justify heavy harassment and termination for nothing less than she can break employment contract with employees after she you've fulfilled her specific needs. Work days are no longer about working in a supportive and enjoying atmosphere in which you can provide enthusiastic customer service for your customer base, but instead is each and every shift feeling like you are walking on eggshells, paranoid that you might make some small mistake and who may be watching so they may report you, and constant worry that you could loose your job at any moment over the smallest infraction. It is only this particular store manager who makes this a poor working environment, which is really too bad. When the same store was under a previous store manager it was a great place to work"
good,"A typical day at work includes stocking shelves and handling customers. Its a very simple jobs but sometimes it can feel repetitive or the day may go by slowly. The co-workers are genuinely friendly, upbeat, and sometimes comical. It's truly a pleasure working there and if it wasn't for the lack of currently available hours I wouldn't even consider leaving."
good,"Typical day usually included time spent at both the information desk and the cash register. Info desk was my favorite because I got to help people find what they were looking for and spend time shelving books."
good,"This is a great job, if you're looking for a short job to last a few weeks. They give you 20-30 hours a week and you're busy for 90% of the time. Can't say you don't have anything to do."
good,"I loved this job! I worked with a lot of interesting, hard working people. I worked the cash wrap for a couple years, mostly cashiering, gift wrapping, and keeping a small area of the store tidy. Towards the end of each shift I would take the majority of the tills to the safe room in the back of the office and count them down and count all that was in the safe and make sure everything balanced correctly. It could be chaotic at times, especially around the holidays and when we would do special events for schools or for release parties, but it was really never stressful. Most of the managers were great and quick to jump in and help. One manager just sat in the back and ate and another one absolutely cannot be pleased and likes to treat her employees like juvenile delinquents. For example, after we closed for the night we would clean the store and she would make us line up with our dust rags and inspect them."
good,"Barnes and Noble is an interesting company to work for. Every store I know has staff that feel more like family than co-workers. A lot of people look at Barnes and Noble as this alternate reality and apply because they think it would be a cool place to work, especially if they are book or music lovers. The truth is, it's retail. An employee will be happier in their time here if they are aware of this fact from the beginning. Most of your day is spent focused on customer service, and most of the time you can have a great time in the process. There is a ton of room for growth within the company, though most managers look for employees to be self-directed on this front. I loved the time I spent with this company and I learned and grew a lot in a short time. However, Barnes and Noble has shifted it's focus from being a neighborhood bookstore to becoming a contender in the digital age: a necessary evil if the company wants to remain afloat. The down side is, they've announced huge numbers of store closures over the next decade... which means your store could close at lease end, without warning, and whether or not it is profitable. It means that there will be fewer and fewer people employed to handle the same, or increased demand. It also means they've eliminated health benefits for part-time employees and shifted their focus from full-time, long-time employees to teams of full-time managers and a mass of part-time staff. It's sad to see the death of a bookstore. But even if Barnes and Noble stays alive... it's forever changed."
good,"A typical day of work at Barnes and Noble was enjoyable. It was quiet, and relaxing. I learned essential job skills that include working with people, listening well to my manager, using my time wisely, and work ethics. The manager was nice, and was really passionate about his job there. The co-workers were friendly, and cooperative. I really enjoyed working around books because I enjoy reading. The people were quiet and not too distracting."
good,"This was one of my most favorite places to work, the atmosphere was fun and fast paced, especially in the cafe. One of the best parts of my mornings here was the morning meetings where everyone would sit together and go over the figures and goals. It really made you feel like you were an important part of the team and built a sense of togetherness. I still shop there today and have a wonderful rapport with the management and staff there."
good,i had a regular scheduled what i enjoyed. first thing in the morning we had to go online to see about customer requests and service. right after that we organized the new arrivals and due to a outprint we had to pull specific books of the shelf's.
good,Barnes & Noble was a great place to start my career. They believe in advancement from within and that their greatest assets are their employees.
good,I love working at the Bookstore. I like helping the students find their books they need for their classes. I enjoy meeting the staff and students. Love my bosses.
good,Easy schedule. Friendly work environment. Was able to gain a lot of experience working with the public.
good,"I've worked for the company for 8 years. They worked with my schedule when I went back to school. I never really had a problem getting time off when I needed it. I'm leaving the company in January with about $30,000 in my 401(k) and, considering that I never made more than $10 an hour, that's not bad."
good,"A typical day at work included taking down and setting up tables and endcaps, stocking and reshelving books, and a great deal of multitasking. Because I was trained in all departments of the store, I worked at a very consistent and fast pace, moving back and forth between the customer service desk, cash registers, music department, receiving and cafe."
good,"Valuable knowledge has been gained on the construction of European-inspired drinks. It is a creative environment, full of opportunities for mixing and matching ingredients to derive something new and unique. I am in the company of friendly coworkers who act more like family. The hardest part of this job is the consistency in which constant physical labor is demanded of me. Although certainly bearable, seems at times, a bit more detrimental and unnecessary than productive."
good,"A typical day at work was 8:30 AM t0 5:00 PM for me. I didn't learn anything that I didn't already learn at Starbucks. The managements expectation versus what is humanly possible was not in balance. The way the cafe was staffed did not lend itself to any team environment and I was fired for ""not calling for help in a timely fashion."" If the cafe manager had not left me alone most of the time this would not have been an issue. She should have staffed the cafe with more people and I wouldn't need to call for help which is something I never needed to do at Starbucks because my boss knew how to staff the store."
good,Barnes and Noble was one of the most interesting places I have ever worked at. As a Book seller for Barnes and noble my responsibilities were to organize and sell books to consumers. My coworkers were the highlight of my experience working for Barnes and Noble. Everyday I looked forward to seeing and working with them as well as the managers. I don't think the pay was good but I did enjoy my time there
good,"Though I was only there for one season, I rather enjoyed working as a bookseller. The only hard part of the job was standing behind a cash register, and even that was only hard because I had recently had a minor injury before I even started to work for Barnes and Noble."
good,Great management. Lots of fun and a relaxed place to read books.
good,this place was so much fun to work at. Barnes and Noble is a very laid back environment with great management. It's a great first job. They worked with my schedule for school and were super great when I had to call out sick.
good,"This will be the hardest job I've left. The people I work with are amazing and we all share the passion of books. The employee age range is a bit older which makes for a more stable environment and we are all working towards a common goal, which is to have the store succeed."
good,"Company is brick and mortar so cutbacks and increased responsibility came with no raises or advancement. "
good,"The environment is extremely friendly, and the customers tend to be easy to manage. Doesn’t offer a lot of advancement but for a simple cashier position they paid decently and were a good place to work"
good,"At the end of the day, B&N is a retail store that offers retail jobs with retail wages. If you've worked retail before you basically know what to expect from working here. I'd say overall the company culture here is better than other jobs I've worked, my coworkers were nice, the customers were rarely too nasty, and I didn't have many complaints about management."
good,"I loved working at  B&N as a warehouse clerk. Unfortunately, it was seasonal and they did not have an open position on 1st shift for me to stay permanent, or I'd still be there."
good,"I got to work with a ton of great people and have met lifelong friends there.  However, like most retail jobs, you are a cog in the giant corporate machine.  Therefore, you have little power to negotiate higher wages since there are tons of other people waiting in line to have your job."
good,"at BN I worked in  a small office setting and it was nice but almost nothing else to do as there were 2 techs and 1 manager with me "
good,"Barnes and Noble is the first corporate job I have worked for and absolutely loved. My managers and coworkers are amazing, compassionate and it really feels like a second family. Literally the only thing that sucks is that the hours are incredibly inconsistent, and for the past year it has been my only stable (if you can call it stable) income. For over half of the time I was employed I had financial support but as of recently I've been on my own, struggling every day to survive. But, I knew from the beginning it was only part time. It just sucks to work my butt off at a place that makes me so happy, to not be compensated for my time and energy. That being said, Barnes and Noble is absolutely fantastic and if you want a job that you will be happy going to, it's definitely the place for you."
good,It overall was a great job. I was able to work alongside and help customers that all love the same thing: books. To be surrounded by books all the time was a complete dream and I was overjoyed to have landed the job.
good,"If I could work here and get full time + benefits, I would stay. I’ve worked here 3 years and love all of my coworkers and love the job. Very fast-paced but we have fun. You can VERY easily request off in a scheduling app (where they post your schedule 3 weeks out) so it was very flexible for me. They also work with a school schedule. I was promoted, as well, to shift lead within a reasonable time."
good,If you love being around books then working for Barnes and Noble is great. The people I worked with were super friendly and always willing to help if I had any questions. Management was great to work with.
good,"Good management! Great team creating enviroment!"
good,"1. With a love for reading I blended into the best employee staff in Las Vegas!"
good,Barnes and Noble is a great work environment because the people you work with have shared interest and are very friendly. The company has some improvements to make but are definitely trying.
good,"Overall it was a good experience. Enjoyable environment, quiet. Keep in mind it is retail so you're going to have the goods and bads that come with  it- rude customers in the public. Receiving position can be a pain if put there. Co-workers were great. It is low pay sadly, even with experience. A good temporary job with good store discounts."
good,A friendly work environment with above-average customers. Very rarely did I encounter a rude or disrespectful customer. Coworkers and managers worked well together and supported one another. Truly a great work environment. I loved it there.
good,Though it wasn't my type of job I really enjoyed my time there. The people are amazing. It is not difficult to learn everything you have to do. The managers there are amazing people.
good,"Although the compensation aspect of the job is something a little less than desirable, or what it should be, the atmosphere and camaraderie makes it a fun place to work."
good,"Easy going and relaxed. Fast paced during the holidays. Corporate gets funny ideas sometimes, but that's retail in general. Don't expect to get promoted they never (or rarely) promote to management internally."
good,"I have enjoyed working for barnes and noble, they are a good company and really do try to keep up to date with this country. I would love to stay with the company but the rate of pay is very low."
good,It's an experience in its self. Loved working there many great experiences. Meet alot if celebrities at events they hosted. If it's you first job it would be the best place to start .
good,Barnes and Noble is a good place to work the only issue is that it was more stressful than it really needed to be. I enjoyed all of my management and co workers but the corporate end wasn't the best. Other than that I enjoyed my time there.
good,"I loved working here. Management was amazing and of the multiple jobs I've held, the most respectful of individuals. The culture fostered here is a community and with the thorough interview process, most of the people who wouldn't be a part of that family are vetted out."
good,So many things going on at this store. Tasks are supported by management. Very responsible management team. Culture in the workplace was good. I learned I was a good bookseller.
good,"On a typical day I would put out new products and assure that my area of the store was clean. I was I. Charge of checking out customers, and selling them memberships and plans to help customers save."
good,"It has been many years since I worked at Barnes and Noble. At the time, there were a lot of major changes happening to the general running of each individual bookstore. When I first worked there, we had at least 7-8 people working the bookfloor at our smaller store at a time. By the time I left we were bare bones with only one person at customer service, one in cafe, one in music, and one at the registers, as well as our two managers. Often time, we would even lose the music seller due to hourly sales. It was difficult to get projects done, and the focus on customers seemed to lack as each bookseller became overwhelmed with lack of hands available. Barnes and Noble used to be a great place to work but as time went on, it was clear the focus was shifting from what used to make the stores great. It made for a very stressful and miserable place to work."
good,"A really fun place to work. No two days are the same. Great staff and great managers who are passionate about books, music, games and customer service."
good,"This was a fun place to work, and everyone seemed to get along very well.  There was never a shortage of things to do.  I was in the cafe, so I was able to sample the items there on occasion.  Hardest part of the job was the customers were sometimes less than courteous."
good,"Barnes and Noble is a great place to work. Managers are normally fun lively people to work with, in my experience at least. Overall I would say it's fun to work here, but not as a career."
good,Personally I believe that Barnes and Noble is a good place for students. It had flexible hours and everyone worked as a team. The managers did a great job on training us so well in the few days we had before school started.
good,"Everyone at this store is pretty friendly. The pay is not exactly a living cost wage, but not bad when there are decent hours. Receive discounts on almost everything in the store and cafe."
good,"Really fun job with an amazing crew, and good customers. No advancement  and not that many benefits. You can’t really make it bough money to live on here."
good,"Everyday is a new day at barnes and noble. There's day where its very slow and relaxed, other days where it's fast paced and stressful. Overall a fun place to work and very nice people to work with. Though management is quite poor for the most part. There are a couple managers that make it worth it. The hardest part of the job is when it gets busy, we have to do tings all at once and help each other out while making customers satisfied. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with my co-workers. I've made many friends at this job and they are the reason why I love this job so much."
good,"It takes a while to learn everything you have to, but once you do, it is a fun and task oriented job. Everyone is super accepting and there are set expectations."
good,"I have nothing bad to say about the company except that corporate has made a few poor choices lately. However, it's a good place with mostly good coworkers."
good,"My store is amazing. My coworkers and managers are a complete team and that is why I love my job. I have not heard the same of other stores so I cannot speak to them but my coworkers will always have my back for breaks, customer assistance, whatever when needed and so will my managers. I have also made many lasting friendships at my store."
good,Push you to sell memberships. Slow at times. Paid 15 min break. Managers understanding. Employees ok to work with. Not many hours. Customers can either be extremely nice or extremely rude- no in between
good,When I worked at Barnes & Noble I experienced the people there as close and unified in making the store a better store. They seemed to be concerned with the teams atmosphere and how well together we all were.
good,"I started this job at 15, it was the best job i had all the way up until Triad. (due to pay/hours)"
good,This was my first part-time job and I loved it. I loved being surrounded by books every day and my 30% off discount. My coworkers and managers were great but the company itself isn't doing well. There was a lot of pressure on selling and it was hard to get consistent hours because of how much money the store made. My store couldn't afford to hire extra booksellers so we were understaffed and I had to do a lot of extra work with no extra pay.
good,"Great place to work, relaxed atmosphere, nice coworkers who had been with the company a long time, pay was low, not many benefits beyond store discount if you are part time."
good,Advancement is not a promise here. I got to see most of the employees be in the same position they had started with years ago. But the staff was very kind. We had a tight knit family relation and everyone watched each other's back. It was a learning experience.
good,"The general employees as most Barnes & Noble are more intelligent than the average retail employee: most love books or have specific music knowledge that can be utilized to better make recommendations for customers. The company as a whole has lost focus as a bookstore and the employees suffer, which is unfortunate because written word is such a beloved passion and readers as a whole might be a dying breed."
good,Great place to work for fun and discussion and discounts. The company doesn't typically adhere to employees with families or family schedules however. More prone to schedule family hours for college students to have the ability to party verses employees with families and slightly less seniority. Weekend hours are hard to change or cut back on.
good,"I love working at Barnes and Noble, they schedule well and are able to work around my college classes. Only issues are benefits and the pay I'm getting isn't enough to pay the bills. Love my workers and managers, the environment."
good,"I enjoyed working in the MSC Barnes & Noble. It was a great location and since I didn't have a car I was able to take the bus to campus and walk over. The people were cool, I got an employee discount, and most of the time the foot traffic was manageable. The only downside was the requirement to work on gamedays, though we were given the option to work only before and after football games, not during the entire game. All in all, a decent campus job and steady money for students."
good,"Great Place for Employment in the Customer service field. Customers are generally friendly, Staff is great to work with. You will be on your feet your entire shift. Shifts can go quickly. "
good,"Great place to work. Loads of different position. Cafe hours are great, as well as the book seller position. Super friendly staff. Great management team."
good,Keeps you on the move for the most part regardless if its busy or not.  Recommend as a starter job to help develop customer service skills and ability to multi-task.
good,"My years at Barnes and Noble were great mostly because I was in management. Many benefits have been taken away from part time employees, and it is difficult to provide enough hours for most employees."
good,This was a summer job I head during my undergrad years.  The manager was great and provided me with a lot of opportunity to expand my skills and work with students.
good,B&N was a great place to work. Workers and customers are very knowledgeable about books. Get to meet people of all types. Learn new things. Relaxed environment
good,"I loved working here but unfortunately, you start to learn how the retail business works; super low hours and not good pay. Constant call outs and call ins. Lack of communication from manager to manager. I've dealt with rude customers in past jobs but I've never seen people go awol over something an employee can't control like parking space, or how people smell or why we can't see how many copies another store has. Lack of staff too because corporate keeps changing it."
good,"Great place to work.  Always something to do.  Management always helps employees with assisting customers, clean up and promotional set up.  Coaching available."
good,This company really believes in promoting those that are dedicated. The environment is great! The people you meet are even better. The comfortability in this job is when you become full time. The only downfall I see is that you only get annual raises instead of every few months of progress. However we are a work environment that looks out for each other and works together as a team day to day.
good,"After 16 years of service I, along with 1800 other employees were laid off.  I am not confident that there will be a lot of advancement available.  Also, during some times of the year, part timers will have a lot of hours.  Other times of the year, hours will be sparse.  I have always cultured wonderful friendships with management, booksellers, and even customers.  That was worth a lot of other things that you can go through."
good,"The workers are very friendly.  Makes working at Barnes & Noble bearable, but be sure to do your tasks.  They will get on your case, if needed.  Learning the drink recipes are easy after a week or two, and the ""rush"" isn't that bad.  I've seen/worked worse."
good,"The B&N I started working for was heavily book-centric, which I loved. The business is heading in new directions, and while I understand that B&N must remain adaptable, I miss the company I started with in 2008."
good,"It was nice. Loved the co-workers, loved the customers. I much preferred working the floor, than being on the register. The management was okay. It was a cross between being amazing, and being horrible."
good,"Barnes & Noble offers a good environment to work in, generally speaking it is a great part-time job however the full-time opportunities are lacking. Hard work is rewarded but not to an industry standard pay or raise level. Overall a good place to work but not a great place to retire from"
good,"Management is fair and understanding.  The  volume of work produced by the dept was very good.  For me, hardest part of the job was the commute into the city."
good,"It was my ideal job.  Being surrounded by books made me very happy.  I believed in what I selling to my customers.  I was their head cashier for the better part of ten years, but my head was full of hundreds of items I could recommend to customers,  It could be fast paced at times, but you could always count on team players to help out when needed.  I miss working there, but company layoffs are not kind to even the longest of employees."
good,"Bookstores are tough work . Full Timers don't need a gym workout. We were a 6.2 million dollar store the best in our district of12 stores. The Company lay off of 4000 full timers and their plans to work with just part timers will save 40 million a year, but the quickness and advice on titles and subjects cant be replaced.The culture among workers was super, We were always over tasked by Corporate but were still capable of helping each other get things done."
good,Barnes and noble cafe is a fast paced environment. As long as you have a decent manager  it is a good place to work. The book floor is much more relaxed but calls for attention to detail.
good,"The environment was great, the people that you work with soon become family.  You will learn a lot about popular book titles, and you will develop an appreciation for reading."
good,"I always thought Barnes & Noble would be a cool place to work in your 20's, and I was partially right, but the corporate structure can be downright suffocating sometimes."
good,"Enjoyed work"
good,"Clock in, assist customers with finding books that they need. There were a variety of cultures that came to work there. It was overall a great experience because you get to learn about so many different books that are out there that you probably wouldn't hear about otherwise."
good,"This is a great job if you are looking for a family of coworkers and management, great customers and have a drive to succeed and work for nothing in return but enjoyment.  Layoffs are expected. Part time employees sometimes get between 0-5 hours a week (20 hours MAX)  Full timers have a LOT of responsibility (which we all love and share)  Corporate is great in many ways, but they are also slowly killing the company (hence layoffs and no job security or advancement, every Full timer that leaves will never be replaced)"
good,"Barnes and Noble is an excellent place to work especially if you are interested in books and assisting customers in finding what they are looking for as well as a few things theyay not have known they wanted before entering the store. The store atmosphere is a comfortable mix of productivity and fun, with a good chance for advancement and excellent benefits and payscale."
good,Barnes and Noble went from advocation localization to becoming a huge toy store that sells books.  Their corporate professionals do not do a good job of preparing for the future and consistently use nepotism for internal positions.  I felt less and less supported every year I worked there.  They do not replace vacated management positions and they eliminate department positions prematurely.  I would never work there again.
good,"The staff is very friendly and helpful with new hires. The managers are also very nice. Everyone gets along very well. Cafe is typically very busy, since we serve Starbucks handcrafted beverages. We do have to try to up sell every customer in line so that's a bit difficult sometimes."
good,"I enjoyed the regular schedule of the Receiving Manager position. Organizational Skills and Time management are essential. In spite of the heavy lifting, I really enjoyed the work. The chance to see all the new Merchandise as it came out of the boxes was kind of like having Christmas every day. The management and staff I worked with were a wonderful team."
good,For both PT and FT employees you can't beat the wonderful culture of books and the delightful conversations you will have with customers about their favorite titles.
good,"I worked at barnes and noble for about 2 months and had to quit unexpectedly due to a family emergency and was treated with absolutely no respect. The managers were very hard to work with in terms of scheduling and unexpected conflicts. Overall, I didn’t have a great experience working here."
good,Barnes n Noble Café is a good job for part timers. If you are still in school or not scheduling is done if not two weeks in advance one. When working you must be punctual and willing to work. The line gets long and it can be stressful but by all means its a great job!
good,"The workplace was more like family. Friendly, easy going, and professional. Co workers were helpful, clients and vendors were a pleasure to work with. Management was really excellent."
good,"Much work to complete at any given time.  Exciting challenges and the reward of putting your thoughts to task as well as watching them come to fruition.  i would say the hardest part of the job is not feeling satisfied with the end of day completion list as there is always much left to do on our list of objectives.  Great staff, great dedicated company and those that work for it."
good,"It's a great environment, and greatly determined by management and the teams involved. But the managers at the Lynchburg store are a unique and awesome blend of bookish, lovely people so they hire the same kind of people. It is a great place to be."
good,I started this job my second year at BCC as a work study and eventually signed on to be employed longer. My manager was great I just needed more pay and I was switching my field of study to healthcare
good,"Barnes and Noble is a great place to work, I am a book worm so i really like being around the books. The management is awesome and really take care of you (even since i was part time)"
good,Barnes and Noble is a highly successful company. Always looking at new concepts and creativity to increase its presence in the marketplace. They encourage a positive work place and they always ensure that employees are happy in their current position. They have a success we kisten program where employees can voice out their concerns or ideas. Great company to work for.
good,"I have worked for B&N for over 2 years, and I always tell people how much I love my job. But just like any job (especially retail), it has its cons. At times the work and the amount of it can be stressful and overwhelming, but management helps to delegate and bring the focus back to sales. The management I have witnessed is competent, respectful, understanding, and fun. For most booksellers, your responsibilities change each shift depending on your daily assignment: customer service, cashiering, etc. Because of this, I’ve obtained many skills across a broad area of study: checking out customers at the register, searching and locating product, customer servicing, order processing, and more. Most of the work involves simply learning by experience. But as a book lover, sharing that love with people is certainly the best part of the job, and something I’ll always look back on fondly."
good,"I have enjoyed my employment with Barnes & Noble Booksellers. For the past 4 years, I have worked in the cafe for two different locations, Temecula and now Riverside.  While a bookstore can have its downtime, there is a lot of multi-tasking and rushing to service customers in a timely, yet friendly and efficient manner. Serving Starbucks coffee and Cheesecake factory foods creates a diverse menu in the cafe and creates opportunity to learn new incoming product. I love my role as a cafe server and enjoy creating espresso beverages for fellow bookworms."
good,"The pay is pretty standard, but of course you get discounts, and the people and overall environment are friendly. I'd highly recommend working at B&N."
good,"Working for Barnes & Noble, I expanded my knowledge of how the book industry works and what it takes to be an effective manager. Although I have managed a staff before, the size of my staff on any given shift was much larger than previous jobs. I love working with fellow book nerds, as we self profess, and people that love to read can bring out the best in you as a person and as a manager. The only real difficulty I have run into was the up and down schedule, but that is normal of a retail management job."
good,"Good place to work for if you are looking for a part time job."
good,A typical day at work will be like me walking in and goes to put the books away. The most enjoyable part is when i able to talk to the customers. The workkplace culture is amazing.
good,"Been working for Barnes& Noble for 16 years now both at part-time and full-time. It is a challenging and sometimes hard to get hours if only working part-time, but the overall work environment is relaxed and competitive in a fun way."
good,Barnes and Noble is a great in between job. Would be perfect for someone in school and needing part time work. On management level there is not much room to grow and the hours are all over the place. Love the atmosphere but the long term benefits are not there.
good,I work at a campus book store and besides rush week work is slow and there are not that many hours available. I really enjoy the job when I do work and management is caring and friendly.
good,"The best place I have worked at so far is Barnes and Noble.The environment is laid-back and friendly, the managers were stellar and worked alongside you, and the discounts were fantastic, especially if you're a book or coffee lover. As a bookseller, the day usually consisted of managing stock, reshelving items, taking customer calls at the ""help"" desk, working the cashier, selling memberships, and keeping the book floor clear of dust. They often do cross-training so you'll likely be trained on how to work in the cafe in case they need an emergency extra set of hands."
good,"There were some blatant issues with management that no one seemed willing to address despite their negative effect on the store as a whole. Aside from that, this is a wonderful place to work. Fun, flexible, and great environment."
good,It was the first corporate company I work for. So thing I had to learn on the fly. Since it was the first store they had in Hawaii & I some how got lost in the shuffle of being trained.
good,"We had a fairly slow location so working here was very nice, but the hours were unreliable and often next to nothing- I quit after a week where I was given only 7 hours."
good,The work was good and i liked it when i was working here.Very fast paced and good if you need a job.The place is productive and nice environment to work in.
good,"If your willing to work the job it will be a breeze. Very simple to understand, just takes time. Organizing books n movement are the only sorta bad things. Management and coworkers are respectful and non-judgmental."
good,"I really enjoyed my managers and my coworkers; for a retail job, I feel I got the least soul-crushing company to work for. However, my pay was minimal despite excellent sales numbers, and I only ever received a $0.25 raise, so I felt like my work wasn't highly valued."
good,Very organized and efficient work environment.  Regular schedule and appropriate break time allotted through out the day.  Exposure to fulfillment of online orders.
good,"A very good job that is not stressful and very good for a high school student. Management is very good, always friendly and helpful. Work itself is very relaxed."
good,"if you have a cohesive management team, magic happens...but if the communication is lost...tragedy erupts. "
good,"This is great experience if your applying to your 1st job. Also, if you love to read, I would also consider applying. I've also learned how to deal with managers and customers while working here."
good,"The place was understaffed most of the time with employees running around like headless chickens to appease the endless lines of customer need. This was because the company was cutting costs just to stay afloat- as the digital age has rendered hard copy books as halfway useless. If one enjoys the ambience of working in a book store with its own cafe, and at the same time making minimum wage, then its not such a bad place."
good,"Very low stress, easy-going atmosphere. Pay is a little low for workload. People are nice, Benefits are good. Unfortunately, brick and mortar stores are a constant struggle."
good,"The company really tries to better itself through store policies and guest interactions. Working at one of the more major branches, it was very organized and the managers are great to work with. Sometimes the communication ladder from the top to the bottom did get muddy at times but I think that's what happens at most big corporations."
good,As a college student upward mobility at barnes and noble is not a concern of mine. The job offered me great discounts on my books and that helped my family.
good,"Not a bad place to work. I met some good friends and learned more about books. I actually started reading more! Management can be a pain and favoritism was rampant within some cliques. Other than that, environment was pretty chill (albeit monotonous) with shelving, cashiering, and night clean up."
good,"I loved the individuals I worked with directly, yet some of the managers working at this company seem to be lazy and apathetic towards the issues that surround the store (customer relations, complaints, etc.). I often found myself not pushed or challenged, and was often bored. Additionally, the pay was not worth staying with the company any longer than I did."
good,You could be yourself there. I also felt very safe because of the mass of security. They treated me with sweetness and kindness. Would work there again if I could.
good,"A Positive Experience That i have learned and grown with, But im looking for more growth. going out of retail into this office taught me alot and i would recommend this place to everyone."
good,"A friendly and accepting environment. Easy to obtain new skills and experience, the management is understanding and encouraging to both their senior staffers and new employees."
good,"I enjoyed my time working here and would happily go back. The only issue I had with this job was not receiving enough hours each week. The staff became like family and I learned a lot about retail from working here. If you're a book lover and coffee lover, this is a great place to work."
good,Like most retail jobs you get the fun of dealing with the general public. Since it's a bookstore there is a mixed bag. Sometimes you get amazing people who love books and are great customers. Other times you get crazy people who try your patience. Barnes and Noble does seem to attract good people to employ though. Many of the people I worked with became good friends and had similar interests. Overall it's a good place to work.
good,"This is a great gig if you need a flexible part-time job. The people are delightful to work with and the store manager is even great! How many times do you read that? Never. Which makes this place sort of an outlier, in the best sense, in relation to other retail jobs. Definitely one of the nicest places I've ever worked."
good,I loved my very first job at Barnes and Noble as a barista in the Café. I learned a lot and loves my coworkers. It was a fun job and it taught me a lot.
good,"It is a nice place to work and your co-workers are very smart. The best tips I can give are: be patient with customers, wear good shoes and keep a good sense of humor!"
good,Working there gave me a chance to experience having a job and make my own money. I also acquired new skills in software field and an understanding of how it can be worked better.
good,"I had a wonderful time working for Barnes & Noble.  The environment is positive, your job is secure and the company offers great benefits for its full time employees."
good,"in a typical day, an employee could expect to see customers come in and go around looking at books. Be prepared to be knowledgeable about popular books and recommendations. You may be asked to do stuff you're not too familiar with, however going the extra mile is definitely noticed here."
good,Enjoy working here. Great benefits and co workers. Very busy work environment and support.  There is a team environment feeling and multiple groups work together and help each other out to accomplish goals.
good,"Great place to work the only bad thing is lack of hours after the peak seasons are over. I mostly worked in the children's department, which I absolutely LOVED!! Plus, I've worked in retail before & their pay grade is on the high side for being a retail store."
good,"I worked at a store before it closed and it was a great place to work. Obviously, even though it is a bookstore, it's still retail. Customers can be difficult, work can be repetitive, standing can be a bit much sometimes and breaks were a little too short. "
good,This was the campus bookstore versus a stand alone Barnes and Noble store. This allowed management to accurately help students schedule around classes and exams. Work was never too taxing (either physically or emotionally).
good,I loved working here while in high school it was near by so it was walking distance the coworkers were fun. I love the managers and the fashion at this store.
good,I wasn't at Barnes & noble for very long. But while I was there it was a good working environment. Had a little problem with one of the managers but wasn't much.
good,This is a fast paced work environment. Always have something to do so you do not get bored. Great chance to meet new people because it is a ever changing group of customers that come in. You learn alot here including patience and how to handle tough situations. You also learn very quickly how to multi task because you will juggle more than one thing at a time.
good,Liked the idea of something new happening everyday. Had the opportunity to meet a lot of great people employees and customers.  Working here allowed me to gain a lot of knowledge in areas I wasn't  initially interested in before.
good,I enjoyed this job. It was a part time seasonal job but I enjoyed my time there. The pay was average to low but it was a good and fun way to make some extra money for the holidays.
good,Great Place to work with great people and wonderful benefits. Cutdowns in staff and hours makes it difficult to control all aspects of the store and increase your business. Late hours make for little or no work/life balance.
good,"Never a dull moment in receiving mostly because there was always something else that needed to be done, but also because I was surrounded by some wonderful co workers. I was one of the managers and we were a tight bunch, always looking for ways to make working for B&N and rewarding and enjoyable experience for all employees. The Christmas rush was always a challenge but the very fact that we always got through made working for Barnes & Noble a very enjoyable experience."
good,"It often seems like work far outlasts day/week.  The store hours are great, the culture is good.  It had always seemed like the advancement is possible."
good,"Come in, explain to people how to use a credit card machine properly for hours, leave. Stressful customer service environment, but employees help each other and management works hard."
good,Barnes and Noble cafe was a fun place to work. Mornings were very busy and the team I worked with was fast and efficient. I enjoyed learning about the cafe business and had a great time serving customers and selling great products.
good,"I love books and literature, and I feel that to enjoy this position, you have to have at least some love of reading. The most positive aspects of the job would be the people that I worked with, the ability to help people, and the engage co-workers and customers in discussions of different books and topics. I enjoyed those busy days helping customers left and right, or organizing particular sections, etc. I found the general atmosphere of the store pleasant, with the quiet bustle of a busy bookstore/cafe."
good,"I was there during a very difficult time for the company. One year they did a wage freeze and gave every employee a $1000 raise, while nice, they gave no one a review. You still need to reestablish your goals and understand how the company sees you. It is a partnership, never be uncomfortable with the direction the company is needing to take."
good,Constant surveillance of eclectic patrons ranging from celebrities to school kids made for busy and somewhat stressful days.
good,"I love the job but manager does not know how to treat employees"
good,"Working for Barnes and Noble has been a good experience, and was especially flexible with my class schedule. However, I do not see any room for future advancement within this company and continued cuts on work hours have forced me to look elsewhere for employment."
good,"As a book floor associate having been moved up to a cafe server, I enjoyed the time I spent at B&N. With a love for the cafe atmosphere and the fast paced environment, I never really begrudged my job until we were lack of employees, and the stronger of us were left to pick up slack. Interacting with customers proved to be both the most rewarding and most difficult aspect of the job."
good,"B&N can be a great place to work, if you are willing to be flexiable with how little hours you get. Unless you want to go into management, there are NO full time positions. Leadership within management is varying, depending on store location. Discounts are decent. Head Cashiers at my location come and go within weeks or months. Too much pressure to sell memberships and now BN Master Card. Too many managers can ruin a store."
good,i really like it when i started out. i worked there for 3 years . the old manager was very for the employees but the new one is very churn and burn and doesn't really have much attachment to her team.
good,"Barnes and Noble is the typical introverts dream, in the cafe at least. Everyone is very understanding about mental/social problems and works to fit your schedule to your needs. Managers can be strict but only when necessary; they are comedic and very caring for your wellbeing. Coworkers are like best friends here, since everyone has worked here for so long. Very welcoming to newcomers of all kinds! No prejudgment here whatsoever, nor discrimination. "
good,"Barnes & Noble was a company in which store managers were able to help each other, and upper management did the same.  This was by design.  As a store manager and a regional manager, I always felt if I needed any kind of assistance it would be provided, and, in the reverse, I might be the one to provide aid."
good,"I worked for there for a little over two years and i really enjoyed it. However, a lot of changes occurred during my work experience there and it taught me how to adapt to the most extreme changes. My coworkers were the best and very supportive, I highly recommend working at BN in Bethesda."
good,"Working at Barnes & Noble College, inc. is an amazing place to work and grow as a professional and as a college student. Being that I work in a college environment, I am constantly engaging others within my job and outward to the customers coming through the doors."
good,"I worked at this bookstore temporarily."
good,As a bookseller they would have me on the floor helping people find the books hey were looking for. other duties were picking up piles of books from the floor and putting them were they go as well as organizing the store after hours.
good,Fast paced environment surrounded by clever and intelligent co-workers. Fascinating conversations and stimulating interactions with customers with all manner of studies.
good,"Very enjoyable work environment, everyone usually has a cheerful disposition about them. I find working here to be fun and educational at times as I learn things that I didn't know to begin with. I don't really have a problem with anyone here these people are like my family."
good,"Contributes to daily operations that generate over $6 million in annual sales of books, magazines, movies, music, graphic novels, gifts, toys, games, tablets, digital content."
good,"I was a barista and occasionally I would run a register at the cash wrap. I was a quiet person and kind of shy when I started but I quickly learned to open up and sell myself which in turn, helped my sales. I learned the names and personalities of the regular customers and developed a friendship with many. The management was always around and available during their shifts. They were easy to talk to and helped to accommodate any issues whether it were personal or business. The coworkers that were there during the same time as I, were all fun and knew everything about the latest upcoming authors. For me, the hardest part of the job was the constant upselling of extra items ( cookies, magazines, Godiva bars) and the $25 member cards that had to be introduced to each customer, every time. The most enjoyable aspect of my job was getting to know people and what their favorite coffee drink was. I would see certain people come in and I would have their drink ready before they ordered. To this day, I still keep in touch with a few."
good,"I loved working here, but the management was always super rude... They only gave hours to their favorites... Everything else was suberb"
good,Professional work environment with great management. No major complaints other than slow at times and not much co-worker interaction while on the clock.
good,"They gave me an oppportunity to work with new high school graduates and older students who have been out of school for quite sometime raising and providing for their families. We were extremely busy during the beginning of each semester, but only occassionally busy once classes had begun and financial aid was cut off."
good,"The stores don't seem to have a lot of available hours for employee staffing, so alot is expected of employees. As a kids lead when I'm in the department I am expected to help customers, complete 4-5 projects, provide backup to other parts of the store, etc all in an 8 hour shift. It can be stressful but the coworkers make it a great atmosphere, always willing to help."
good,"I loved books and the job and i enjoy people i have a good personality and i also liked learning new things and help customers find what they are looking for ,"
good,"Barnes & Noble was a great place to work. Management was friendly and helpful, fellow employees become friends, environment is engaging and fun."
good,"Doing all the inventory for the music department."
good,"This is a GREAT first job.  But it is that, a job not a career.  Due to state and national laws, a lot of the benefit plans offered to part timers have gone away, and especially in southern california, the pay just isn't enough to support an adult."
good,Great place to work while still in college; they work well with you school schedule and you learn how to work well with people for people.
good,"A typical work day involved a large amount of customer interaction. Each customer had their own stories to tell and made the work day much more enjoyable. Management was easy to work with but was very focused on the numbers. It would sometimes cause tension between the departments and the coworkers. The culture of the café and bookstore brought in a lot of different people as employees. The coworkers enjoyed their work which also made the work day enjoyable. While working here, I learned a lot about how to interact with a diversity of people as well as widening my own culture through the product we sold. Training new employees gave me expertise on organization and adapting to new programs."
good,"At this job I was able to learn patience while doing customer service because there were people buying book so they would take their time to figure out what they really wanted. My management team was amazing they were very helpful with anything I needed. They made it very easy for me to get the hang of things. The most enjoyable part about the job was working with my co workers, they had great team work skills."
good,"I learned a lot about customer service and how to promptly and accurately take and prepare customer orders and up-sell based on customer tastes. I also learned a lot about how to take the initiative and keep the workplace running smoothly. My coworkers and managers were all pleasant and easy to work with, ensuring a relatively stress-free environment. While it was at times difficult to keep up with rush hour demand, the pros - serving customers, interacting with people, and providing friendly service - definitely outweighed the cons."
good,I loved everything about this job when I worked there. Best time to work was during the holiday season when it was always busy!
good,"Loved the employee discount, but wasn't loving the minimum wage. It helped when I needed money, though. And I am happy they kept me as long as they did."
good,"There is A LOT you have to learn, if you are working at one that has collaborated with a school, like on a school campus. So be ready for a information overload. It was a very nice place to work. My manager was super sweet, and understanding. They were considerate, and open it was like one of the best work atmospheres I've ever experienced."
good,"You're always busy, people ask the most pointless questions, you never get to sit down. Worth it if you're a book lover. The holidays are terrible, but you can't really expect anything else from a retail place."
good,A lot of the day is spent as customer service helping customers find what they are looking for. You will be very active merchandising tables and endcaps and shelving carts of books.
good,"Every day is different at Barnes and Noble.  Flexibility is key to success, as you could find yourself helping out in any department:  Receiving, Cafe, Music, Children's, or on the Bookfloor.  The most important competency is to embrace customer service, but it can be challenging to balance the desired high level of personal service with the numerous daily and weekly tasks that need to be accomplished.  Barnes & Noble employees are generally world class; they are interested in what they are selling and want to share their favorites and new discoveries.  The rapport among the staff makes the workplace enjoyable, even when times are stressful.  Stress, and the hardest parts of the job, come from a few key areas.  First, as is sometimes common in retail careers, the equity in rotation of hours and shifts is not always applied.  Additionally, payroll numbers are very challenging to bring in, especially (and not surprisingly) during slow times in the fiscal year.  What makes that more challenging is the amount of cross-training required to run a successful ""skeleton crew"" that can do everything (cafe, receiving, shelving, etc.) in the face of shift trimming and call-outs.  Professionally speaking, my time at Barnes & Noble honed my multitasking skills, challenged me to prioritize and marshal my resources properly, and helped develop the management skills needed to operate successfully in a larger, corporate retail environment.  Personally, my time at Barnes & Noble allowed me to work with some of the finest people I've ever had the pleasure of working with, people who live to share"
good,I enjoyed my time at Barnes and Noble. I was actually upset that I had to relocate and leave my job. Nice co-workers and fun place to be.
good,This was my first job I did a little bit of everything for this company even as a cashier I had to clean bathrooms. management is ok didn't pay me for some work hours one time.
good,"this was a seasonal position for me however, the experience gave me the opportunity to learn more about retail."
good,"I worked here for a long time and learned so many different skills. Days were always busy.  Community Relations was my favorite position.  I loved working with the teachers and school districts. Increased sales by 300% in the first year.  Developed ongoing relationships with institutional and corporate clients. The Assistant Manager position taught me more operational skills, workload planning, training, hiring and development of booksellers. The hardest part of this position was no longer being able to have a direct hand in the sales aspect.  I really like to sell!"
good,This was a job I took on after school to gain experience and wound up staying longer that I thought. I grew very close to the staff and customers and enjoyed working at this place.
good,"Co-workers and management are great. Very welcoming and everyone is treated equally. Whether it is a slow day or a busy day, you will always have support from other employees. Being in a mall, you do come across some interesting people, but not all of them are pleasant. Being in a bookstore, you will always have inspiration for something to watch or read."
good,Who doesn't love books.  I work with great people.  The company is going through some changes and I wanted to see if there was other opportunities out there for me. I have worked here for a long time and enjoyed the experience.  I work hard and always looking for creative ways to bring in business.
good,"Working in the textbook department for the local college, a typical day includes putting up shipment of books and supplies, entering book information for classes in the upcoming semester, cleaning and organizing the department, and helping customers."
good,"A typical day in my position as receiving manager involves receiving the daily shipment, processing and sorting new merchandise, and taking care of any miscellaneous tasks, such as processing vendor returns or performing stockroom maintenance. I also spend some time working with booksellers and training them as needed. The management team is very supportive and industrious, and they are always willing to lend a hand or answer a question. My co-workers are equally supportive, on both personal and professional levels. Their ability to do their job well allows my job to run smoother and more efficiently. The hardest part of the job is making sure that all of our inventory numbers are correct; it is important for me to make sure that everything is being received properly so that our inventory levels are accurate. The most enjoyable aspect, for me, is being able to physically see how much work I've accomplished during a given day. Having this visual reminder is a great boon to my morale, which helps increase my productivity. This job has helped me learn and improve upon my time management skills, various procedures for receiving shipment and returning product, as well as management skills and delegation."
good,"I work in the music department, so my day consists of researching musical artists/bands/ etc.. and movies."
good,"This is a great job for students that need flexible hours. The management varies from location, but overall is well received. The culture is good and there are always friendly and interesting people to meet. There are variety of different departments to work from, all one needs to do is communicate the desire, work hard and prove your abilities. However, I will say that it is hard to go up the ranks."
good,"Exceptional place to have spent the last 17 years. Management was most accomodating in areas of scheduling and training. A typical day can put me in 5 different areas of the store! The hardest part of the job is the physical nature of moving on average 50 pound boxe, crawling in the floor, climbing ladders 20 feet up.. My coworkers are extremely pleasant to work with, they are the most enjoyable part of the job. Also, due to my longevity, I seem to be a go-to person for many different questions. This is very enjoyable as I can usually help them out."
good,"A typical day for me lately would be working in our Music/Dvd department. I open the area, making sure the music on, a movie is playing on the tvs, and that checkpoints are working. I proceed to ""sweep"" the assigned areas of dvds, which is just making sure nothing has been stolen. After, I complete different projects for the department that I look up on the computer. Throughout the day my managers will come in and tell how sales are going and making sure all things are running smoothly. The hardest part of my job would be when working in shipping/receiving and having to receive the shipment, which is sometimes made up of over 150 boxes. The most enjoyable part though would have to be the environment. Its always peaceful and a fun place to be in, and all my co-workers really contribute to that."
good,"My days are focused on customer service as well as stocking and managing inventory. The hardest part of my day is trying to figure out which book with a blue cover had been featured in a book review or on a television snow. Once a week, I run a writer's group where I help authors in the community learn more about the craft."
good,"Making drinks, talking to customers about books, and cleaning cups and plates. It was busy and fun.  I wished that the store stayed open."
good,"This job taught me the most about myself. "
good,Barnes & Noble College was the first job I ever had. The management and employees always worked through tasks with me to show me and explain how things are done. But they also let me out on my own to preform tasks on my own when they felt that I was ready to.
good,I really enjoyed working there. There was always something to do and learning about the products we sold was always interesting.
good,"Customer Service"
good,Retail sales and merchandising with a priority placed on customer service.
good,"Jobs , such as shelving , returns , organizing , cleaning , marketing , receiving and more long term projects have to be accomplished within the context of immediate customer service needs. Teamwork is thus prevalent and essential as everyone at every level is primarily a bookseller . So, as we all relied on our co-workers to get the jobs done a kind of "" band of Brothers ' mentality often occurs.."
good,"Co-workers and customers made the job enjoyable. Employee discounts for merchandise was nice, too."
good,I loved the culture of the staff and customers.  Overall a great experience.
good,I love making starbucks drinks and I love most of the customers I get. Most of the people I work with are pretty nice and fun. Making different combinations of drinks for customers. Being able to read as many books as possible and talking about them with curious customers.
good,Strong atmosphere with a comfortable managerial system that provides the right incentives to accomplish tasks.   
good,"Every store has a different set of ideals. The particular store that was worked at did have many clicks that you would have to walk around and tip toe about. The benefits such as health insurance were amazing at amazing prices, however the eye and dental could have used work. Barnes & Noble was a very peaceful and wonderful place to work with its wonderful customers and the smell of books! Unfortunately, when Barnes & Noble produced the Nook, they poured too much of it's resources into it and many of the booksellers felt that their jobs were at stake with the new ""digital"" plan and had felt the company lost focus on them as their employees. The best part of the job was dealing with many of the customers as there was a mutual love of books."
good,"Great workplace, employees are great to work with, very supportive management."
good,"This is a good place to work if in college, unless wanting to take a lead position; then do not even think of furthering education goals. "
good,"A typical day at work consisted of ensuring quick and friendly customer service while maintaining a clean and well stocked cafe. There was continuous prep work and cleaning to be done between customer interactions and a strong team of co-workers made all of the tasks run quite smoothly. In this busy environment, I was able to strengthen my skills in effective communication among customers, co-workers and supervisors, in addition to strengthening my multitasking skills. The hardest part of this job was in the stretches of down-time, when there were no customers coming in and all of the prep or cleaning work was already taken care of. I found the idle moments rather difficult, but would often find other small cleaning or organizing tasks to keep my hands busy. The most enjoyable part of the job was first and foremost the customer interactions and ensuring excellent service to all who entered the cafe."
good,"A typical work day mainly consists of helping customers find books. Whether that book be in your store location or another, or even online. Sometimes the customers will ask your opinion on well known novels, so being an avid reader will be useful. Other tasks include cleaning and maintaining the store, organizing and restocking the shelves, and ringing customers up at the cash register. There is also a heavy emphasis on selling memberships, this was mostly easy except for the few customers that mentioned Borders's membership being completely free. However Borders is now out of business so that part should be easier. "
good,"Pretty much what the title said. I work predominantly in the cafe, but sometimes work on the book floor. I like my job a lot--but I do wish it was easier to get more hours and thereby more money. The people at my store are awesome, and the regular customers are always friendly. If I was given the option to go full time for higher pay, I would, but I need to find another part time job right now."
good,"Barnes & Noble was a busy place and fun to be.  I chose the Holland location over the Grand Rapids location because of the wonderful team there. I went on sales calls and consulted on the various NOOK devices to surrounding hotels, school, and restaurants.  When I worked on site at the store, I stayed busy with the NOOK Counter and Customer Service Center. "
good,Enjoyed talking to customers about what books they were interested in.
good,A typical work day included providing customer service to students and staff housed at the University of Tennessee Health and Science Center (UTHSC). I learned about various tools that the students needed in order to simulate real world application. The management was great and stressed the importance of customer service. My co-workers also ensured that this was taken care of as well. The hardest part of the job would be when we had to construct the dental kits needed for the dental students' projects for that year. The most enjoyable part of the job was rendering customer service in a variety of ways to the diverse customers that would frequent the bookstore.
good,"Everyone on the Barnes and Noble team are welcoming, supportive, and kind. Though there is a lot to learn, you have nothing to worry about because everyone is there to help you."
good,"I worked for Barnes and Noble College Booksellers at Houston Community College for over a year. I also worked at the University of Houston of two semester rushes. When I say rush, I mean RUSK!! The amount of textbooks that fly off the shelf is amazing. The time in between is not the best time. I was very creative at HCC keeping myself busy."
good,Restock books clothes etc.
good,"Most booksellers will tell you they could find a better paying, lower stress job, but they stay with B&N because of the love of reading. Working at a bookstore is indeed an education, and it beats the heck out of selling cameras or clothes!"
good,"Overall a good company to work for. Offers great health benefits and paid vacations. Company is dedicated to offering great customer service. Although schedule is pretty flexible and can be done around school requirements and special requests, a lot of nights and weekends are required. Corporate office does want all Stores to operate the same to make it easier for transfers but it takes a little of the fun out of working for an individual store. Unfortunetly a lot of employee turnover in the last couple of years. Pressure for add on sales can sometimes be felt by booksellers. Barnes & Noble does offer quite a few perks such as a great discount both on books and in the cafe, and sign out options for new books and digital product. The company also likes to promote from within if possible and offers the ability to transfer to a different store location. Relocation in not mandatory but might be necessary if you want to grow with the company."
good,Great opportunity to develop retail math. Product development and a real opportunity to see your work out in the real world.
good,"It is a typical retail store, but if you enjoy reading, and suggesting what others should read, it is a great environment for you."
good,"Barnes & Noble was my first job, and I loved it. Great company and easy work to catch on to. Management and coworkers make or break this job. Barnes & Noble will always be a company i'd be happy to return to."
good,"Working at bn mellon was one of the best. Good work life balance, excellent Manager. Worked on sql 2008, upgrading now to sql 2016. Good team. Less travel, challenging work"
good,Even through being employed through the purchase and the reorganization. I enjoy the way the company concerns itself with its employees. Imput is not seen as an issue. Leeway to mothers.
good,"•	Delivered exceptional customer service and ensured high levels of customer satisfaction"
good,"A good place to work. Good culture and management. I was sorry to leave. With my disability, I was still expected to work registers. Memory issues with register procedures because of illness. It was embarrassing for me to keep needing explanations. Book knowledge and sales ability were underutilized."
good,Good if you don’t mind standing 8 hours a day. You deal with a lot of older people. It’s fast paced and people get impatient. Requires a talent in sales and a lot of patience. Everyone has each other’s backs too! And good discounts in the cafe. If you know a lot about books then definitely recommend. I’m currently in school and they let me pick my days!
good,"I'm still working at Barnes and Noble and it is a pretty decent job. Almost everyone is really nice, there is maybe 1 person I don't like to work with but that's it. There are obviously some rude customers sometimes but this is Naples so you get used to that pretty quick."
good,"Management positions participate in the hiring process, coach for results and work on a very tight payroll budget. These are working on the floor manager positions. You carry around a tablet that gives you access to e-mail, reporting center for financial information, and HR functions."
good,"I arrived at 8:00AM and started on whichever task management wanted me to work on which ranged from stocking new books to labeling books to answering phone calls and helping customers. This helped me develop conversation skills. I would usually leave at 4:00PM. My supervisors were very good at working around my school schedule, and encouraged a casual friendly working environment. I very much enjoyed talking to one of my managers who I was friends with. It took a day to figure out the book organizational system but once I did the job became a lot easier. It was also a challenge to help a long line of customers quickly by looking at their schedule and finding all their school books according to their class code, title, teacher, and section."
good,"I enjoyed working in this position for the short time I was there. You have to learn a lot quick because you are thrown into a busy environment, but once you get the hang of most things it is smooth sailing. My one issue is scheduling. I was hired part-time but I ended up working full-time amount of hours because they were understaffed in the cafe."
good,"The hardest part of the job is they expect you to do a lot with some time with little resources or time to complete the task. However, management does try to help out."
good,Working at Barnes & Noble is so much fun. The managers are wonderful and flexible with hours. The other employees are welcoming. Everyone that works there makes it feel like a family. The work itself is also very rewarding and enjoyable.
good,"This is a fantastic job, just not a career. Bookstores are closing everywhere, so management is fixed with people who’ve been with the company a very long time. However, it is a fantastic 2nd job, gig for someone in college or retirement, or if you’re into retail (and the pay that comes with it). Work culture is great!"
good,"Work is a bit repetitive but I'm given a large enough degree of autonomy that I don't get too bored. Tasks are fairly simple and while selling memberships is difficult, the low amount needed makes it achievable."
good,"Barnes and noble was my first job when moving to Delaware. The environment is fun, accepting and casual for people who need to fit in. Some of the ""bookseller culture"" can be considered frustrating and at times unfair in a world pushing away from books."
good,"I completely enjoyed working for B&N. They tried to work around days you wanted off so there was work/life balance. Everyone had different passions so you learn from others. Enjoyed sharing my passion for books with customers. There was some stress with having a small staff, lots of projects, and helping customers. You have to know how to prioritize and manage time. But great environment!"
good,"If you need a job for extra cash, this is a great place for it. Almost everyone who works there part-time has another job on the side besides management. They're very flexible with their hours and I love the discount we get."
good,"So, here's the deal, it's a pretty good job. It's pretty much like any other retail job, but they really push selling memberships and add-on purchases. Mostly memberships. If you are good at getting memberships, they hardly have you go over to work with customer service. Instead you're just a cashier, which again, it's just like any other retail job. You will probably get stuck alone at the register for a whole shift but you end up calling for back up a lot so it's not like you will be bored. The co-workers and regulars are really nice and interesting. They are going through some changes of  procedure so newer employees do things a little different from employees who have been there a long time. There's a pretty good discount too. The managers work with you if you have a schedule for class or a second job. So if you like books, or just hanging around at Barnes and Noble, then this is probably the job for you."
good,"loved working here, only left because i had to move but would definitely work there again if i get the chance. managers and supervisors are extremely helpful"
good,"It's retail like any other place. It is a bit more relaxed than other stores, but the pay and hours aren't worth the hassle. The managers at my store were awesome, however they had to make constant cuts to work hours."
good,"I really liked working there I just wished they were able to give us a raise. I really wanted to stay there but with groceries and expenses that were coming with my apartment, the pay was not enough for all that I needed to work with. I still plan on working with them occasionally. I loved the working environment but the pay just was not enough."
good,"A typical day at work is busy, generally a bunch of regulars and a few people who we never see more than once. The employees talk to each other and communicate well across the store. There's a bunch of cleaning and prepping to do for the next day around 4 pm and opening procedures earlier in the day. The hardest part of the job is how fast paced it is, one moment there will be no foot traffic and the next, the line is out the door. The most enjoyable part is being trained well enough that you know what to do in every moment. You won't get bored working here."
good,"The work environment is pretty relaxed and enjoyable. Being a bookstore, people assume you're fairly well-read and smart since you're an employee and tend to more respectful (though don't take that as a guarantee by any mean). I like to imagine the hard parts of the job as more of an acting gig, which I guess applies to a lot of customer service in the end. You MUST be able to sell memberships or management will most likely switch you to cafe work. If you're a sociable person that is good at improvising their way through an English paper, you'll find this job fun and enjoyable!"
good,Managers worked with us on hours and training. Memberships were pushed all the time. Other employees were welcoming and helpful. One of the managers was a little rude.
good,"Got the Barista job with the hope that when a position opened on the book side I'd be able to move over there. Eventually, a position opened but it was filled by a new hire. Was pretty bummed about that."
good,Barnes and Noble is a great place to work if you are interested in a retail environment where you can be around books and music while helping people enjoy their day.
good,"I've been at BN for 4 years now. My co-workers are lovely, my bosses are fair and I have a reasonable amount of responsibility and pull with what I'm allowed to do. However, if upper management doesn't want to promote, they won't. They aren't in the store to watch your progress or see how well you handle the role, if they don't -feel- like they should be promoting from within, they won't. Other than that the company offers alright benefits, if crummy pay."
good,It was a good job for the time being.  Pretty fun and relaxed environment and had great coworkers that were very understanding and willing to help whenever the time arisen.
good,"Plus: Training for all positions was adequate for positions. Working in a bookstore is pleasurable. Most people working there loved books and long-term employees were upbeat and excited to go to work."
good,"This is a pretty good place to work. Most coworkers are nice. Management overall is good. Would like better career advancement opportunities, but is a great entry level job."
good,"Working in a bookstore is always a fun job for me. It affords me the opportunity to not only become familiar with previously unknown tome books, but also to interact with people, customers and colleagues, who enjoy those books and are knowledgeable in those fields. Working at Barnes & Noble afforded me that opportunity, as well as offering me a fun and flexible workplace."
good,"When I was just finishing up highschool and getting ready for college it was a great way to make some extra money and have fun doing it. What better for a young nerdy boy than a job at a book store cafe. Save a few hefty events and an intense shopping season, it was never more than we could handle. A great way and more enlightening way to get young people into the workforce and getting some experience!"
good,"During an opening shift I would stock the books before customers arrived, retrieve online hold orders, and clown the store. Throughout the day I would answer phone calls, help at register, assist customers in locating particular items, keep the store organized, set up tables and sections for book promotions, and reorganize the layout of the sections in the store. During closing I would put items back in their places and make sure the shelves were organized. This work place trained my in different locations in the store so I would be able to help in every area. This helps me gain experience at register, how to answer and assist customers over the phone, organize, and see new books/movies/music coming out that I would not had heard of otherwise. The most difficult part was learning how to juggle helping customers on the floor and on the phone at similar times."
good,"I absolutely enjoyed my time with Barnes and Noble. My employees were my favorite part of my job.  I loved building relationships with my customers and my booksellers, and I really enjoyed sharing my knowledge with my team. It seemed as though our corporate office didn't understand what it took to run a store. They were constantly giving more and more work and less hours or coverage to get it done."
good,"I enjoyed the opportunity to to meet and work with friendly and capable management colleagues in a productive working environment at Barnes & Noble.  I was able to participate in interviewing,identifying and training promising book and music sellers.  We all worked at creating a cooperative and productive working environment for the benefit of our customers.  Together, we developed a friendly and welcoming environment which was appreciated by our customers."
good,"This is the job for you if you enjoy reading and want to know more about the world of book-selling. The culture was great and enlightening. The hardest part of the job is when customers complain about prices. We simply can't compete with the prices available on Amazon. Also, more focus is spent on us trying to sell memberships and B&N credit cards than the books."
good,I had a lot of fun working at the Cafe. The people were great and every day was different. Learning the ropes of the machines and the cash register were interesting and something that I will have forever. The customers were always nice. The fast paced atmosphere was challenging at times but overall rewarding.
good,Being in the cafe leaves us almost to our own devices. This leads to learning how to manage and accomplish tasks independently. Although there is not much help from management on the book floor they do what they can.
good,"Barnes and Noble always has great managers that I could never hate. And if there was a problem, then there was always HR, but I never did need to. There is terrible problems with hours sometimes, and there's no way that I saw to become a manager without getting manager experience. If your'e not a manger, you don't get full time. Part-time has virtually no benefits as expected except paid vacation. It's also way too boring to do any position except cafe and customer service. They don't cut your shift or send people home, and the corporation cares about pointless percentages too much. You get no raises or anything for doing a excellent job, unless you are way overqualified."
good,Fast paced working environment. Need to be a multitasker but very customer focused. Always room for advancement if you are proactive in seeking learning.
good,Very flexible with hours and accommodations but not enough opportunity for advancement. Very helpful and friendly environment for workers. Good management and training.
good,My favorite thing about this job was it was on campus so I could go to work right after school. I didn't need to pay for transportation in any way to get here. I liked there was a specific shirt to wear every day. Managers were cool. Very fun temporary job
good,"people are mostly really cool, managers included. Corporate has a lot of BS going on that the store itself cant do anything about i.e. sales goals and policies"
good,"I worked as a part-time bookseller and it was always interesting. However, there weren't many opportunities for advancement. For the amount of hours I worked part-time, there were no benefits. It is what you expect from a retail work environment at times but it is a lot better than what you expect from a retail job. If you like books its a great place to work."
good,"Show up for my shift, put my apron on and do what needs to be done, whether that is restocking cups, shelves, or baked goods ect. Take customer orders, cashier and clean up the cafe. Management was decent and organized. Workplace culture was very open. Hardest part of the job was balancing baking with helping customers. The most enjoyable part was seeing many familiar faces on the daily, working beside sweet and fun coworkers and working in a family built environment."
good,"This was my first job and I feel like it prepared me well. I was trained in everything I needed to know, and the coworkers were very nice. You'll have a couple different managers, with at least two on duty during the mid-shift. They're always eager to help. The work got a tad monotonous, just shelving books and checking out customers (on different days of course), but what do you expect. The managers are very good with working with your availability. The application they use to schedule is very user-friendly, and you're usually scheduled about two weeks in advance, so make sure you let your managers know about other obligations you may have well in advance. There is a 30% discount on most things, and this is upped to 40% on two separate weeks out of the year. You do have to try and sell memberships, and if you don't sell enough the managers will talk to you about it."
good,"The best part of the job is the people I work with. I really like my management team. The people I work with are all interesting, intelligent people with similar interests. The workplace culture is great.I love selling books. I enjoy a lot of the customers, especially some of the the regulars. The hours are tough, though. I often close on Saturday and open on Sunday, which is hard on me physically."
good,"While working at Barnes and Noble at the University of Houston-Downtown, I was able to meet others from all over the world who each had a goal in mind of higher education. I learned a lot about my campus and what it provides for those who attend."
good,it was a fun place to work at while i was there and i would work there again if i could. i liked that i could dress up in a suit and tie every once and a while and i also loved the events that we held
good,I was on the floor at the bookseller for the first 3 years.  I really enjoyed when I got promoted to kids department lead.  I was in charge of planning the storytime activities and changing out displays.  I found that the most enjoyable tasks.
good,Overall it was a good job and I made a few friends. There were times I wanted to leave but I really loved it too much to actually wanna leave. Cool management too!!
good,"lots of advance copies, check out books from store, 50% discount on cafe items, lower staffing levels equals fewer opportunities to get to know the merchandise and more pressure to add-on sales. See the conflict there?"
good,"The company is definitely for someone who LOVES books. The store I was at was a great mix of older and younger readers. With the company in a seeming death spiral, they miss developing their main assets, the employees. They'll save the plan-o-gram people and other executives that are purely dead weight, but fire the people who best understand the company and stores. I hope the CEO realizes that the people make the store, not the corporate dead weights."
good,"Excellent company, was there 20 years, job loss to due company wide lay off. Worked with some amazing people and met many customers who are now friends."
good,"Daily time spent rotating stock and keeping shelves clean, working information desk to find or order books needed, put them in customer hands, some time on cash registers. "
good,Great cafe and fun activities for kids enhance workplace. Opportunity  to read books before the release dates.Great employee  benefits and discounts plus caring managers.
good,"I had fun doing my job as a Digital Lead at Barnes and Noble. When the Nook reading devices declined in popularity, I was sent to work behind the cash registers where I managed to lead the district in new memberships for two consecutive years. I like sales and wherever I was placed I made a contribution. It was a great place to work with great people. What I don't believe was handled well was the layoffs of al e lead positions. They were sudden and just dropped on us with no warning."
good,"B&N hires the best people.  It's the coworkers that make this job amazing.  Everyone there is fun, intelligent, and shares a love of books and reading that can't be found anywhere else.  Even though there were many expectations, metrics to hit, and tasks to complete, there was never any stress or pressure about the job.  We did what we did for the love of the people around us, nothing more."
good,"Working at Barnes & Noble is a lot of fun. The atmosphere is very lively, customers are open to suggestions and thankful for assistance, and the managers/co-workers are great to work under and make the job a joy to come in."
good,I really enjoyed the work pace here. I enjoyed not having a uniform too. Having to push a paid membership was difficult since most companies now offer free memberships.
good,I loved this job. Reading is my absolute favorite hobby. I would love to have continued to work there permanently. I loved working in such a collaborative work place.
good,"Barnes & Noble is a wonderful place to work as a starter job. Though they do have room for advancement eventually in the future as positions open up to the workers, mostly hiring from within."
good,B&N will help you increase your vast knowledge about books.  You get to meet all walks of life while working for this company.  If you have a love for books then this is the workplace for you.
good,"Great management, stimulating and exciting, loved everything but cashiering; loved one one one with customers on the floor and behind the customer service desk. I surpassed the character count, and am still not being allowed to proceed."
good,working there was pretty nice. I helped people find the books that they where looking for. I gotten better with my communication skills. everyone was pretty nice. There was really nothing hard. The job was pretty simple. My most enjoyable part was helping people find the books.
good,it was quite hard work for me as I have to lift heavy boxes through out the day . I was enjoying QC work but it was very less . timing was good so I can balance family life .
good,"The work environment was fantastic, Great team great events, lots of fun.The pay could have been better and the opportunity to advance was very difficult...it takes a very long time and there are limited work positions available."
good,I loved working with the booksellers. The culture is forward thinking and there is a genuine love for the products. At a store level I had no complaints but the District Manager has oversight on all promotions and does not communicate well enough with staff to make informed decisions.
good,"Usually busy to start with customers waiting to be helped. You get "
good,"I have worked for Barnes & Noble for more than 10yrs  Excellent benefits,  health insurance, paid vacation, employee discounts, flexible scheduling, friendly coworkers."
good,I enjoy working at this company mainly due to the people I work with.  Everyone is friendly and helpful.  The job is relatively easy so it's not very challenging.
good,all my coworkers were awesome and very helpful to each other. Management was very helpful and understanding with a lot of situations. just had very few hours and very few days scheduled to work.
good,"Nice people, good first job, sometimes a little overwhelming, must be quick on your feet. Overall a good experience, I would work here again. However, not much room for hand-holding."
good,I was a bookseller. They never scheduled me outside my availability and management was always available for help. We would meet every shift which is nice and we would get to read while working.
good,"Like any retail, the hardest part of the job is dealing with difficult customers. That being said, the people that you work with are great and make up for that. There is a real sense of comradery.  For the most part it is a fast paced job, though there are times when it is quite slow. All in all it is a good place to work."
good,"This job is really great if you just need something supplemental.  The management team I worked with was phenomenal.  I enjoyed the company of the other employees and really learned a lot about coffee and literary products.  Unfortunately, it is hard to survive with the amount of hours that are available.  Great place for a first job."
good,"Working at B&N was one of my favorite jobs to work at. Like any other retail job at times it was stressful, chaotic and hard. However, there was an overall mentality to the store that made it easy to come back to work each day. "
good,Great place to work.  My most enjoyable part of the job is seeing what books people are buying and giving recommendations. We have a lot of regulars who love to come back for new books.  Nice environment
good,"Very laid back company, fun coworkers. Very easy to learn new things and to expand. Flexible hours and easy to gain new hours or switch shifts if needed. I would say the hardest part of the job is having multiple projects due at one time and not that many employees to do them. The most enjoyable part of the job is my coworkers and the joy I get when helping someone find joy in reading."
good,"An excellent place to work if you like talking to people and enjoy a variety of tasks, while being surrounded by media-related products constantly. A very fun place to work."
good,"A great place to work, especially if it's your first job. They promote from within and full time employees get full heath, dental and vision coverage."
good,"You need to be prepared to work and follow the strange rules that the head of the company says Booksellers need to follow. If you're lucky though you'll have a great staff like I did, which will make working at Barnes and Noble much more enjoyable."
good,"Worked on a college campus so the work environment was more relaxed and customers were mainly students and their families. Both the beginning and end of the semesters can get hectic, but coworkers and management were very supportive. Typical day at work included folding clothes, arranging displays, ringing up customers, and making sure the store is clean and presentable."
good,Very busy during rush but fun to work at. I am a seasonal employee so I can only speak on the times that I am there. It's easy to learn and you can get hired but there is never a permanent position it's just seasonal.
good,"I've worked here 5 years and learned so much from everyone, even my regular customers. I've learned how to run every area of the store and enjoyed every new challenge. The management team definitely shaped the way I approach a customer or a tough situation. My coworkers became a family and it has been hard for me and anyone who works here to think about leaving. I think anyone would be happy to work here."
good,"Most of the people working at B & N are essentially nice people.  Even the toughest bosses are still nice when not under the gun."
good,"Working at Barnes and Noble provided me with incredible skills in customer service, leadership and creative thinking. The management team was always there to help with anything I needed within the job or advancement within the company. Incredible workplace culture from fellow booksellers up to corporate employees."
good,"I enjoy working for Barne's and Nobles the people here are great, I learned to multitask and to keep customer service as top priority. My co-workers are great and understanding. The enjoyable part of my job is seeing the customer smile after they are helped."
good,A nice bookstore where I sold books to customers and provided them with customer service and gave information about Barnes and Noble products and promotions
good,"Mostly spent stacking and organizing books and helping customers. Management and culture were nice. Nothing too hard, nothing too easy. Same with enjoyability. I learned what having a job and job related responsibilities is like."
good,I really enjoyed working here. The employees were great and all had quirks that made it easier everyone get along. Holidays were the toughest. This is a good place for someone looking to work during summer/holiday breaks but I dont think it would last long term
good,"This was my first job and it was very easy to get used to. Not an easy job, but close enough to a routine that you knew what you were getting into without being routine enough to get bored. Coworkers were very nice and break times were good"
good,"I love the job.  The people you work with are amazing, and the customers are great as well.  It is easy to build rapport with the clientele, and the employee discounts are wonderful.  The only things I dislike are the pay and the part time hours, but it's retail.  That goes with the territory."
good,"I was able to utilize my knowledge, register experience and customer service skills at this job. Management was good and department supervisor was ok. This job was only seasonal but, it was a good job overall. I just wish I had known the other employees better to know their strengths. A quite busy store in the Glendale area."
good,"If you are a people person working in the cafe or bookstore will be really fun though sometimes horribly busy."
good,"Very sales focused. management relies heavily on sales and customer service staff, often with minimal coverage. Very hard but enjoyable work. Work can be overwhelming during the Christmas season."
good,"Barnes & Noble is a very enjoyable work environment. You are expected to be productive but never with attitude. The secret with this company is tht for booksellers, management uses an array of ""triggers"" to measure your performance. I.E. How many BN member cards do you open? How many Mastercards, etc...even in their Cafes, what is you average transaction $ amount, how many espresso shots can you sell etc... I have found that just making the effort to engagement the customer in a selling conversation is all you need for a long and happy life with this company. Schedules can be a little whack, with them changing week to week."
good,It is a good place to work. People are nice and friendly. They help each other and share ideas. Compensation wise it is ok but it can be better. Overall it is a good place
good,Lots of fun customers & a lot of regulars who learn who you are. managers are great too. Work with a lot of awesome people. You always get free food from management too.
good,One of the best things about Barnes and Noble is that it provides a peaceful work environment. I also really enjoy my co-workers and my management. They're pretty flexible with availability. I do not receive any benefits from B&N
good,I liked the people who worked there.  They were very helpful with assisting me with my purchases. They treated me with respect and took my feelings into account.  The hardest thing to do in the Barnes and Noble was getting every thing I needed in the time I had in the store. The most enjoyable part of the time was the help I received in the store.
good,"I was a manager at the store, so my experience was different than many. I would open or close the store (keyed manager) and either get the registers going, count down drawers and the safe, etc. or do the same thing in reverse for the evening."
good,"I specifically work at the Barnes & Noble closest to the Florida Mall. They're really easygoing which helps with flexibility, and unfortunately result in a few communication issues. Overall its a great environment, just a little stressful from the influx of non-english speaking patrons. Its very slow, so if you need fast paced, this is not the location for you."
good,"There were some really fun job activities like story time for children and new book release events.  The part of the job that caused me to leave was, as a manager, a conflict with how the Store Manager and the District Manager handled a situation involving an employee and another manager smoking pot. It led me to have difficult times respecting them."
good,Retail can be heck but for 4 years I worked with one of the most pleasant staffs and management teams I've ever had the pleasure to work for. Barnes and Noble as a whole tries to cultivate a atmosphere for those that love book culture. It is the main reason I stuck with the company as long as I did.
good,"While I personally did not enjoy my time at Barnes & Noble, it had more to do with my personality type then the company itself. They provide excellent training to prepare you for a typical day. They provide benefits. But they require a lot of your time."
good,"One of the better jobs I've had so far. The people working at the B&N Cafe felt like family. I absolutely loved all of my coworkers. "
good,Its avery good place to work in situated in the heart of USA New York. I enjoyed working here. I had very good coworker and very friendly work environment
good,"I really liked working here, it was a very relaxed job, and I was able to interact with a lot of people.  Finding what the customers wanted was my favorite part about the job because they were always really excited, and I felt happy and accomplished.  The management was really good.  The store manager was a little bit scary and strict but mostly she was nice.  My co-workers were very nice and I connected with most of them.  There really was not hard part of this job, it was very relaxed.  The most enjoyable part was helping people find the books they were looking for.  I learned great customer service skills here."
good,"This was a fair job. It works really well for college students, but it was not particularly fulfilling for me. They are also good about working with your schedule for school as long as you let them know far enough ahead of time."
good,"Typical day is a rather relaxed atmosphere."
good,"I am a college student and work at the campus bookstore. All employees at the bookstore get along and we are constantly trying to better the store and improve business. The bookstore is  in a temporary building due to reconstruction, so it's not appealing to college students. Distributing and collecting books at beginning and ending of the semester gives us a busy season, however off-season is slow. This is great thought because with working in between classes or at night, you don't leave work stressed or mad ever. Very good for your mentality."
good,"Most of the day is much of the same, check in, take Nooks to the display, rearrange books, take care of customers, inventory, and take electronics down, wipe tables, and check out. Everyone did what they were obligated to do, All student workers got along."
good,"This is a very good job to begin at, but the managers will make you want to quit at times. One manager would say one thing, but then another would tell you differently. "
good,"The company has a long and proud history. "
good,I enjoyed working at Barnes and Noble. The management and my coworkers were both friendly and professional. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with fellow students to assist customers with their purchases.
good,Great place to learn customer service and sales. Co-workers are fun to talk to and work with. Everyday I learn something new also meet new people.
good,"Barnes & Noble is great for the book-lover/geek in us all. We embraced that culture. It is difficult to find a job where you have so much in common with your co-workers and at B&N, you do."
good,I would put books away and help customers fine books. I would also check customers out on occasion. I was cosntatnly helping people and making personal relationships.
good,I worked really long hours and sometimes it got boring. I was motivated up until a certain extent. It wasnt many employees working in my section which made it a bit harder on myself.
good,"I got to learn a bit about a very early version of SAP.  Used Excel, Outlook and Word extensively. Had a very good rapport with supervisors and managers."
good,"I loved coming into work everyday! There are two things I love, books and coffee! I loved talking with the customers about there favorite drink and there favorite or current book they were reading. The smell of books and coffee... you can not get any better!"
good,Barnes and Noble is a very relaxed and fun place to work while also maintaining efficiency in the sales and marketing of books.
good,"Greeted students and staff"
good,"A typical day would vary depending on which zone you are assigned to for that day. There are several different zones including cashiering, customer service, zone maintenance, the Nook department, the Kids department and others. The main thing that i have learned from this job has come from the customer service department. I have learned to be extremely, possibly excessively, cordial, courteous and friendly to customer no matter what their disposition. Before starting this job I was already familiar with most tasks a retail job requires (from working at the Wine Seller.) The managers tend to give an unexpected amount of freedom to the average employee. An employee is finds their given zone of work, punches in, and simply begins working on anything that may need work. The managers trust that the employees will always be doing something productive. They will assign direct tasks and projects when they are of urgency. This dynamic makes the average employee feel valued and respected."
good,"a typical day at work was great..good customers, friendly environment,good management. I always got paid on time. my co workers had respect for the job and eachother."
good,"Great on the job training with exceptional co-workers and a management team that inspired productive performances. Learned something new every day, whether faster techniques for visual merchandising, customer relations, sales strategies, or even new and exciting merchandise. Unless you're a manager though, the pay is minimal. However the company offers benefits even to part-time employees."
good,This is a good company to work and grow in.  The company is focused on serving the customer and creating customer loyalty.  The pace is fast and you must multi-task and be efficient.
good,Working for Barnes & Noble was overall an amazing experience. I have never worked with such positive people. I honestly felt like family while working there which says a lot.
good,"The location at which I was employed had a low-stress work environment with the opportunity to work with some of the most pleasant people you'll ever meet. Management is very efficient and well organized and you will feel valued and cared about, as every employee is a critical member of their team. All of this contributed to the best retail working experience I've ever had."
good,I have worked at my current job for almost 4 years. I do enjoy my co-workers. I do think at times that the communication level is not the greatest. There are times when I have had to ask about a certain project or what was I required to do. My boss is outstanding is always willing to help me if I neeed it.
good,"Good place to work, pay per hour is mostly minimum with few opportunities for full time. Other than that the customer base are mostly quiet good natured readers. Even if you occasionally get the nasty it's not the norm."
good,"Major retailer located in lower Manhattan selling books, video, music and gift items."
good,A typical day at work consist of me unpacking boxes and sorting them onto carts. Management made the workplace very stressful but the amazing coworkers made it a fun place to go to work every day. The hardest part of the job was the physical labor. After a while I could not keep up with the demand that was put on me. I loved my coworkers and the events that we got to run together
good,"Barnes and Noble is a fun place to work. I've been there for five years and have heard horror stories about other sorts of jobs where people deal with terrible bosses, coworkers, etc. That's never been the case here. My coworkers are relaxed and easy to get along with, and management is understanding and personable. Everyone has their own little personal flare and the store's structure encourages individualism rather than mass-produced retail robots. Individual work is rewarded when it goes above and beyond the standard call of duty, and everyone pitches in to find creative solutions to problems when they appear. Being in this job has massively boosted my confidence, and I've learned skills and proficiencies I never even knew I had. I wouldn't trade the time I spent there for anything."
good,"Barnes and Noble was an interesting experience for me because it was my first chance to work in retail. As a whole I enjoyed it very much. Some days where better than others but that's the way it is with most jobs. "
good,"I only worked here for winter season but overall, the job was really chill. It was holiday season so it became very busy throughout the day which led to long lines and furious customers. There are a lot of drinks to memorize so study up. Once you get into a pace, you really forget about what you studied and just start working by muscle memory."
good,"As far as retail jobs go, a great company to work for.   Part-time employees are given vacation time after six months with the company, and when promoted to full-time, receive great health benefit packages.  But, as with all retail jobs, pay is poor; advancement regardless of competency can be at the whim of management or can be put off until a position is available.  The quality of the management team can affect the experience.  Regardless, an overall positive experience, but one I would recommend mostly for students, retirees, or applicants looking for a positive part-time job."
good,This was a great place to work.  Only issue was there was not a chance of promotion.  The company had stagnated due to e-books.
good,"My typical day in Barnes and Nobel's includes taking out trash, cleaning bathrooms sweeping and mopping floors,dusting bookshelves, minor repairs, painting, polishing all metal and wood work in store. My co workers are very easy to work with beside working hard we try to have laughs and fun which makes for a great work environment. management is very professional and also very pleasing to work for. the pay could be better but in all its a great establishment."
good,"I've been working at Barnes & Noble for over ten years now, and there is a reason for that. The customers that come into this particular store can be such great people that I have personally developed meaningful friendships with them. "
good,"A typical shift at work begins with a briefing of the day's events. I delegate tasks for the day between the other employees and myself and make sure that they are accomplished in a timely manner while simultaneously attending to customers. I have learned a great deal about working as a team. Holding a more important role in the workplace means that I am depended on more and I realize that I have no room to slack off as it would create more work for my coworkers. The hardest part of the job is making sure everyone else is getting their work done while still accomplishing my tasks, but it is also a very enjoyable part. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with the customers and my coworkers; it is a great environment and I truly enjoy going to work."
good,"I enjoyed working at Barnes & Noble mainly because my coworkers were great people who felt more like a second family.  Working in the cafe helped me to build better multitasking and problem solving skills and provided the opportunity to further my customer relationship skills.  My biggest complaint is one that is common in retail: it is difficult to work expected hours and support a family; work-life balance is practically non-existent. "
good,"I enjoyed working at Barnes and Nobles, the staff was friendly and the management helped each other in all departments."
good,"No matter where I work at as long as I love working there then it's all that matters.  I love to read and working for Barnes and Noble is pretty self explanatory, considering I'm working with customers, as well as employees who also love books.  I also work with amazing and interesting people, so work is never dull.  I've been a customer for Barnes and Noble for years and even though they do not offer health insurance, I do love working for them.  What I do not like is the pay I received.  With all my experience with customer service, cafe, and sales I expected a little more than minimum wage. Also, I'm a student who needs to pay rent and having only part-time hours even though I was told I can receive full time is upsetting."
good,"There is always something to do between customers. Very customer oriented, I have learned to go above and beyond for my customers and build strong relationships with the community."
good,Barnes & Noble is a company that offers management a great deal of hands on opportunities.  The job requires you to be able to multi-task and be able to direct employees while ensuring customer focus.
good,"Great people to work with, many opportunities to learn and grow professionally. Good work / life balance.  Great discounts at stores and B&N Inc.  Lines of communication could be improved as well as systems which are in the process of being upgraded."
good,"Working in the Receiving department was great; most of the time I only interacted with my fellow employees, being given tasks by my manager and set to work, which I prefer. However, I was still required from time to time to go out onto the floor and give the cashiers or customer service reps a hand, or to cover a break. I didn't mind this, as I learned quite a bit about what we had in stock through working in Receiving, and it was nice to put that knowledge to use in helping customers."
good,"Great place to work as a starting job, or a second job. You can meet many different new people while working here and create new friendships that will last into your next stage of life. Benefits for part time employees though are practically non-existent, and the pay isn't that great, but Barnes and Noble store employees here are like a family. You will grow close to them and love them as you would love a family member. That is the best part of the job, your coworkers, the worst part is the fact that some days you won't have much interaction with customers because there won't be any."
good,Enjoyed the experience of working at Barnes and Noble for over 20 years.
good,If you love to read this is an amazing place to work. It is small enough where it does not get too hectic but it still has its busy days. The people are all intelligent and hardworking and provide a great work experience.
good,"Barnes & Noble has been my favorite job so far. The management team and corporate structure are fantastic, and the employees were all knowledgeable and friendly all the time. Pay and benefits were decent. All in all it was definitely a good place to work."
good,"Barnes & Noble does a great job at making you feel very much on the map. They listen and really consider employee ideas from the top to the bottom. Even the lowest employee in the totem pole gets a say. The compensation, however, is not as on pair. They pay at a very low rate and strive to painfully reduce payroll with no overtime."
good,"management changes often. Lately lots of people have been leaving the bookstore. It's easy work, really. You really earn what you get."
good,"Although extremely busy, I am able to see how i contribute and we are great family environment."
good,Steady during the summer slow during school year.  The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to train a staff with your knowledge and the customers.  The customers make everyday enjoyable.
good,I enjoyed working with Barnes and Noble Booksellers for many reasons.  The simple fact that they have tons of literature to read and the atmosphere was awesome. I enjoyed making Starbucks coffee for every person entering the building the smell of coffee always had me going especially in a fast paced environment. The holidays where fantastic we would market different items for display according the season it was really nice experience.  The hardest part of the job would looking for the hidden coffee cups left by our customers in different parts of the store or pieces of muffin or cupcakes wrappers waddled up in some book shelf but it was all good our customers where really great it was very cultural and the coffee just added the right touch.
good,Fun place to work. your coworkers will soon become your family
good,I loved working here between school breaks but wish it paid more.
good,Very mellow work place with awesome co-workers. it was a pleasure
good,"this is a nice job job to start from, If you can be an open person to customers to provide an great time for them."
good,its always busy and there is always something to do. i love the people i work with. days go so fast.
good,"Under dagen så arbetade jag i lagret och sorterade böcker, staplade hyllorna med dem och satte prislappar på dem. Jobbet hjälpte mig utveckla min noggrannhet samt gav mig en stor känsla av ordning och reda. Mina arbetskamrater var ljuvliga och oerhört vänliga, jag såg alltid fram emot att komma in till jobbet på morgonen och spendera en arbetsdag med dem. Fastan jag fann lagerarbete att vara ett tufft jobb så älskade jag att vara omringade av böcker. Det var en enkel process med att stapla hyllorna och sätta prislappar på böckerna, och efter en tid så fall jag in i en god rutin med mina medarbetare."
good,"Barnes & Noble was an amazing place to work, especially if you love books and people. Staff was amazing while management was easy to talk to and worked well with school schedules."
good,"Its a fun place to work with a great team. In the mornings you get to see the new books arrive and place them in their sections throughout the day. Management is often fair and very easy to geta long with and the other booksellers just make it even more fun. But due to the hours of operation and the schedule required, it can get exhausting and unfortunately the pay is just not enough to live on. Good second income for a two income house though. The most enjoyable part of the job is the customers, especially the regular ones who come back often and talk books with you."
good,"I was promoted rather quickly from bookseller to department lead to manager."
good,"fun workplace, great room for advancement , wonderful management team!"
good,"I have worked for Barnes and Noble College Booksellers for over three years and in that time I have grown vastly as an employee and an individual. I will forever be grateful to my managers and coworkers who were able to see how hardworking and dedicated I was. As a result, I was given many responsibilities and opportunities to prove myself to be a valuable asset to the company. I have been provided with many opportunities to train, develop, and inspire other employees. I have developed skills in employee relations, client relations,  and accounts receivable/ payable (to name a few). I have also completed their management development program. Overall, working there was a great experience."
good,"Sense starting school and living in Ridgeland, it is very hard to drive to HHI almost everyday for this job. Also, the job doesn't have any benefits, which is very disappointing. Don't get me wrong this qould be the perfect place to have a part-time without benefits because it really is an organized and fun establishment to work at."
good,"Though the hours were limited, this is a great company to work for. I love the spirit, teamwork, and dedication my coworkers and managers held. They worked hard to keep the workplace drama free but most definitely an enjoyable environment. They also had great incentives! :)"
good,"As department manager I was able to have great control in managing the department. the corporate offices provided great back up and instruction. The management team I was a part of was wonderful. We had each other's backs when needed. "
good,"I worked in the Shipping Department of the college bookstore on campus.  I got to work with all the freight companies like UPS, Fedex, and DHL.  I also was involved in purchasing orders from publishers such as Mcraw-Hill and Pearson.  The main activity of the job was to receive packages from publisher, delivered by freight companies, and log what was received.  The secondary duties of this position were to log inventory and provide customer service."
good,Met many different students while having access to books for my classes.
good,Very student friendly
good,"A typical day would be mopping, take out the trash and tidy up things that needed to be repair."
good,I love how management is very flexible and understanding. They work around your schedule allowing you to pursue other paths. I started with the company Jan 2011 and started a Paralegal Certificate Program that following March. Management did everything they could to keep me on board and allowed me time to go to school and take care of other obligations. My co-workers are not just my co-workers but my friends. Everyone gets along fairly well and it's just a joy to be at work!! I love it!
good,"Great company to work for, positive work environment and very family-like"
good,"B&N College Bookstores can be a very fun work environment. They WILL work around your class schedule, and also allow you to work as many hours as possible, no restrictions like a normal campus job would have."
good,"Loved working with all the books, liked being a cashier, book stocker, ordering books, customer service, enjoyed all parts of the job, full time with benefits."
good,"Nice place to work, good co-workers, poor rate of pay, but typical of retail."
good,Working at a college book store helping your peers and getting discounts off of your books has to be the best job ever.
good,-Discounts in store and with other companies
good,"Barnes & Noble is a wonderful company to work for. I've had a great experience when dealing with coworkers and management. As a lead, the managers are supportive and helpful when it comes to daily tasks and making sure all associates stay on point and do what is required of them throughout the day. My coworkers are hard working and always willing to help when necessary. The hardest part about working here is the same across all retail establishments. Working with the general public is not always an easy or a pleasant experience. It has helped me learn to deal with different types of people and personalities in the most effective way possible. The most enjoyable part of the job is definitely the satisfaction of helping people and being around books. I've been able to help parents get their children to love reading, simply by finding a topic or a story that would interest them. Books are a very personal thing and I enjoy getting to know people on that level. It has helped me develop as a person also."
good,"Assisting customers with their needs, making reccommendations based on personal interests. Designing displays, setting up fixtures. Ensuring proper merchandise is maintained. Staffing and coaching booksellers in different departments, such as digital, toys & games, cafe, and receiving."
good,A fun environment and very accommodative to balancing work hours with personal life.
good,"Barnes&Noble Bookstore is one of the top book retailers today, they offer just about all products and services to the customer in their market.This company is very detailed and organized with how they display and market all of their company merchandise and serives. In my experiences with this employer I have developed so many skills and talents which I continue to use in my career to this day. I believe that next to the board of education and public library they are the coner stone in education today. Barnes&Noble offers a great work atmospshere in which an employee and grow in their work ethics and professionalism."
good,"A friendly and fun workplace. Fast paced workplace with daily customer interaction. A nice choice for someone interested in a career in the book industry. The company offers good compensation for your work as well as an extensive benefits package including paid vacation, paid sick leave, paid personal days, medical, dental, and life insurance, as well as a company contributions to your 401k."
good,"I enjoyed working at B&N. Fun place but the pay is very low, and most employees work only part-time so it is hard to make a living here, unless you don't need to worry about money. Good employee discounts, and you are always sure to get your breaks and lunches, and no overtime. Good opportunities to learn new skills, but not much room for advancement or movement to full-time. Seems like there are so many people calling out sick on a regular basis that the on-site staff always feels short-handed on any given day."
good,I appreciated that my manager assigned jobs based on skill levels and interest. I never worked in a department I was completely unfamiliar with. And I was asked to assist with departments and projects I could be excited about.
good,"You really should be at least a casual reader if not an avid one. If you walk in and haven't read a book in more than six months, you may get the job, but you won't be happy."
good,"Everything about the company was amazing, from managers, to the available tools & resources, to the processes and systems used to drive the business!"
good,"Being a book lover myself, the store was the perfect job for me. The environment is very relaxed, even when the store is full, many people don't seem to allow themselves to get stressed out when walking through the aisles. The management team is probably one of the best groups of people you could possibly work with, being so understanding and motivational. Of course the most enjoyable part of the job, if you happen to be a book lover like myself, is a thirty percent of discount off of anything in the store depending on the price and if it's already on sale."
good,I matured and grew as a individual. I learned how to operate professionally and found that to be the most helpful. Helped me in a way that will last me for the rest of my career.
good,"I honestly loved working at Barnes, but I left to look for a full time job."
good,This had to be one of my best job I just had to leave because they weren’t paying enough. I worked and when to school so this job was perfect for that kind of set up
good,Great place. Learned a lot about Customer Service and problem solving when it came to Customer care. Learned manager level techniques after working in the Cafe area
good,"I enjoyed the work environment here, most coworkers are willing to help each other out. Management is helpful and supportive. Flexible schedules are available."
good,The job was very relaxing the environment was relaxing. Although this was only a volunteer experience it did teach me a lot. I had fun working with everyone.
good,"Depending on the customers you encounter, working for BN is extremely rewarding and a great building block in your professional career. Its a great atmosphere with great coworkers you will remain friends with long after you're gone."
good,Employees were mostly introverts but all nice and have their own passions they love to share. They even had an employee book club and cultural week of dressing into popculture themes.
good,"A typical day at Barnes & Noble is opening the store and setting everything up, making sure everything looks nice and orderly and helping customers out as much as you can,the people are very friendly and helpful if you need questions awnsered."
good,"Great first job experience."
good,"Great workplace and coworkers, with good management, but doesn't pay enough to cover cost of living in the area. I would have stayed if I could afford to."
good,"I work in the cafe selling Starbucks coffee and drinks and a variety of food. It's a fast paced job, but not as overwhelming or stressful as serving in a restaurant. The people are kind for the most part, and we have fun as a team. The store manager and leads are amazing. Sometimes we're floated to work on the floor and then we get to be around and talk about books. If you love books and coffee - or at least cheesecake -you'll love it here."
good,"Worked there many years. Seems like there is something new every time I go into work. Either hosting an event, learning about the new books that came out that week, or being brought up to speed on new projects."
good,"Working at Barnes and Noble as a barista was great while I was in high school. I had very flexible hours and the work culture was great. Barnes and Noble really cares about its employees. However,  there is not a lot of opportunity for job advancements and the pay is not good for anyone who actually needs a job to sustain their life. Great for a little extra cash though."
good,"A great place to work. Great coworkers. Once you understand the tasks at hand it becomes fairly easy. The only thing I would say against it is the competitive sense that appears when striving to sell, sell, sell. The pressure isn't that bad buts it's there. Luckily I have some good coworkers and managers around me but at times it does come down to how much you sell at then end of the day and if you're worth keeping."
good,Barnes & Noble is still a classic bookstore that enjoys providing great customer service.  I learned a ton working there about not only my job duties but how to deal with the public.
good,"Barnes & Noble, despite its size of two stories and a cafe, never fails to engage customers to create a welcoming and cozy environment for its participants to read. Working at customer service in such a huge store can seem daunting at first, but with all the merchandize being so meticulously organized, makes for employees an efficient workplace."
good,"Established retailer,  fast paced environment. Typical day at work is focused on customer experience while managing the needs of the business. Constant turnover of employees, so plenty of opportunity for training and development. Many opportunities for creative problem solving."
good,I worked cashiering when necessary; I was in charge of one of the departments but also worked in other departments to make sure all books where back on the appropriate shelves.  Interacted with customers and helped find the location of the books they were looking for.  Made sure that the books were re-shelved according to there assigned code and location.
good,"Honestly, one of the most fun places I've worked at. The staff are all close and get along great. It was the type of environment where you could get everything done while still having a good time with fellow employees. The one con is the lack of hours for part time employees. If you have a manager and a shift lead on hand you are only going to get 4-5 hour shifts."
good,Great if you are a busy student or just want to try something different. Very relaxed and easy to do. Would be great as a first job or for someone who can’t do a whole lot.
good,"A typical day at work includes checking in with all associates, conducting a morning meeting, set and maintain displays, and provide backup to all departments. It is a great place to develop customer service skills and soft-selling techniques, and management is usually approachable and willing to coach. There is always something that needs to be done, so it's easy to stay busy. Most employees have some kind of creative outlet or outside passion, which makes for a diverse and interesting atmosphere. The hardest part about working for B&N was selling member cards to customers, but corporate goals for selling them are reasonable and attainable. The most enjoyable parts about working for B&N are the people, the discount, and the customers (most of the time)!"
good,"The workplace is very friendly. While it was a fast paced job, it is quite clear that everyone has their place and are important. Even as a temp I was treated with respect and got the same treatment as someone who planned to work there longer."
good,"The company culture is unique at Barnes & Noble to say the least. Be prepared for constant change as product and promotions change incessantly. In my store, the management staff was strong for a long period and I am regretfully leaving that team. Unity is big. Friendliness is big too. And it all comes down to salesmanship."
good,"Loved customer service. Helping customers find or order the right book. Enjoyed working there, supervisor nice and helpful. Enjoyed the employees discounts."
good,Cafe is typically busy during the mornings and during lunch hours as you tend to have many regulars who arrive to the mall to walk in the morning and mall employees stop by for a coffee or lunch break throughout the day.  Always something to work on and to help keep clean.  Frequent interaction with book floor staff and decent discounts on food and goods.
good,"Good training culture, they make sure you're equipped to actually doing things without throwing you on the ropes. Relaxed environment, and I never had any concerns of not physically being able to keep the store stocked or to satisfy all the customers, which I've dealt with before. Great working culture as well, although there's some gossip (but where isn't there workplace gossip, really?)"
good,barnes and noble wa s a greta place to work. the manager were  understanding and trained the employees well . i wish they paid more .other than that i have no complaints
good,The job was one of my best experiences. I enjoyed helping students because  i now what its like to be a student and I also enjoyed the atmosphere. The vibe was always positive and I learned a lot about time management.
good,"The management at the Naperville B&N is sometimes lacking, but overall they do their jobs pretty well. The cafe is a relaxed place to work but it is busy."
good,As a company there just isn't as much room to grow as there had been in the past.  There are less full-time positions and they are not as stable as they once were.
good,It was a temp position for rush during the beginning and toward the end of the semester. It was fast paced and students were usually stressed during this time so it was your job to do all you could to ease that stress by getting them what they needed quickly. If a costumer was being rude we were told to get management so they could handle it and we could move on to helping someone else.
good,"I really enjoyed working for Barnes and Noble. I worked as a sales associate. I stocked merchandise, completed sales/cash transactions, assisted customers and helped with store events. It was fun. The pay and hours were good."
good,"Enjoyed working at my particular location, however management has changed since I left. Manager was fair to employees while still serving the customers. Work was challenging but not overly difficult. Lots of different aspects to the job so you don't get bored. Must enjoy working with the public."
good,Worked there short time due to their need for seasonal workers due to students getting their books for the new semester. I worked there with a friend which helped me enjoy the work.
good,"a great company,"
good,"work with friendly people who helped teach you how to do different jobs, it helped me understand more about subjects i didn't know everything about and a great environment."
good,"Liked the flexibility, learned how to categorize and stock the books, worked well with the staff and loved working with the customers. This by far was my favorite job. The hardest part of the job was getting your work done before going home. The most enjoyable part was meeting the customers and hearing about their book experiences"
good,"Any gripes I could have of the job were entirely my own fault.  They treated me kindly, and with the exception of a few bad customers, I loved working there.  Shame that they only gave me a few hours a week."
good,"When I didn't have to deal with the food and drinks, I had to maintain the dining floor and change trash. The managers were nice and so were the co workers. They truly didn't let their outside life effect. Plus the discounts were very nice. I will definitely miss those."
good,"Not overly stressful for a retail job, but selling memberships is pushed and your membership percentages are important. They try to cross train employees in all areas (cash, bookfloor, cafe) so you get experience in different aspects of customer service/retail work."
good,All of the staff were very helpful and assisted me in becoming the best I could be. It was fun to work with all the customers and help them find what they were looking for.
good,working for Barnes & Noble Education you become a part of a family. everyone knows everyone and helps you out. the company is understanding and looks out for their employees.
good,"This was a faced paced environment with friendly co-workers.  We had the opportunity to meet all walks of people and help assist with books, snacks, drinks and other items."
good,Its a place to get to know your workers and students along side your management or managers. the entire where house is clean collective and the areas where you work in are clean and easy to work in.
good,Fun to work at. Hard to keep a paycheck if you are a book lover. The atmosphere is amazing especially during the holidays. Everything is very festive and fast paced.
good,Working at Barnes & Noble is a fun relaxing experience. Most managers are respectful and understanding of your personal life. Working in the Cafe area can be hectic and busy sometimes but in all employees here know how to work together in a team to keep the store in place and organized
good,The place was good its like most other retail jobs to be honest but the culture there when I worked was very collaborative and we had a really smooth shift going on there.
good,B&N is a great family feel.  The company is supportive and great to work.  They have a good training system in place and will work to to prepare the team to succeed.
good,"I started as seasonal and was hired on full-time in the cafe. It was a lot of work but manageable, but I had to quit for personal reasons. The pay was fair and the workplace culture was something I easily adjusted to."
good,Barnes & Noble was a nice place to work. The associates and customers enjoyed the store. We felt like we were providing a needed service to the public.
good,"I enjoyed the people I worked with so much. The work at Barnes and Noble can be stressful because of customers and high traffic, and you need to be really good at upselling. That is a super important part of working as a book seller at Barnes and Noble. You must try to sell the membership to every single customer, and that can be stressful because customers can be really rude to you about it, and the managers really push you to get a certain number a day. You do not get anything out of selling memberships except bragging rights. It is kind of fun to be competitive with other booksellers, but it is stressful if you're struggle to meet your goal. Other than that, it is a great place to work."
good,"Great work environment, great work balance. "
good,"Their hours are flexible, the work is interesting, great employees and managers to work with.  The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with customers and finding out what their preferences were when it come to books, cd, and movies. Meeting customers and learning about the community."
good,"I regret leaving.  I let myself get too stressed out, but it is a wonderful place.  You are surrounded by a high-class clientele and get to be productive."
good,"I loved my job and the people I worked with, however the company eliminated the position that I filled, and so my time with the company has ended. I highly recommend this company for its work ethic and crew."
good,A great workplace to work at. Everyone was helpful and supportive to everyone who needed help. Enjoyed working with everyone. nothing to complain about. Great place
good,"it's been awhile since I've been there ,but i enjoyed the place.  good people, good technology, good advancement.   i had a lot of fun there in and out of work."
good,"very fast-paced, learned a lot about books, the hardest part of the job was learning where to locate some of the books.My favorite part of the job was seeing the customers excited about the books they picked and excited to get home to read them."
good,"Barnes and Noble offers a lot to those who love books and like to interact with th public. During peak hours it really keeps you busy, far from the stereotypical “library” atmosphere. There are customers to serve and always work to be done. It’s a great job to hone your ability to talk to anyone from any demographic. It also reinforces strong sales techniques and salesmanship skills. Management has clear and well thought out strategies to achieve store goals and bolster its metrics."
good,"A typical day was mostly helping customers, and other workers/management to get things done. Some days where very busy others where very slow. Hardest part was not buying everything!"
good,The Barnes and Noble management team in Dothan Al is excellent and really tries to work with you and understands when the unexpected happens. Communication between departments could be better but overall it's smooth sailing. It is difficult to get into a fulltime position but you can pick up hours as part time if you don't mind being called in or asked to stay late.
good,"A typical day at work is clocking in, helping customers, making sure customers buy things, recommending titles to help customers buy more, and then cleaning up the store the best you can and the fastest you can. Despite their flaws, barnes and noble is an excellent company to work for. The culture is palpable. There are plenty of decent managers work with and you have take the good with the bad. The hardest part of the job is being someone who loves to read and who maybe slightly introverted, attempting to sell memberships and titles to people who quite frankly, don't want to be bothered. Overall this is a good place to work."
good,"Working here was a joy, 90% of the time.  I thoroughly enjoyed the people I worked with and working with books was a dream come true.  Customers, for the most part, are pleasant."
good,"This is a great place to learn how business works and how it many times succeeds in spite of itself. You get to meet many interesting people and work with some great teams. The management trend has been toward micro-management, which is always a losing approach, but a good team will get you through. The culture is positive and the benefits are quite nice. They will ask a lot of you for the pay, but the relationships may mitigate that. If you are willing to work hard on many things at once, you will do well."
good,It's a lot of fun just wasn't what I was looking for and I would say it's great costumer service experience for anyone who is younger. Younger crew and management is fair
good,"B&N was a great place to work..when it was run by booksellers"
good,"Despite the problems that I had with the store manager, working here was a dream come true. I have had the best conversations with customers here. The environment is something you can easily adapt to. There are days you get lines and a bunch of questions, but I have never had a bad day here."
good,A great place to work.  You are exposed to learning all different types of positions within the management opportunities. Great place to help customers of all ages.
good,"Could definitely pay better for their baristas. Hours are flexible and management is great. People are the best, but the pay is next to nothing. I work harder then a normal Starbucks worker and get paid practically half"
good,Great place to work if you love books.I really like the staff and teamwork environment. The store also has great discounts as well. If you like being around books and working in customer service this is the place for you.
good,"I overall enjoyed working here. Some days were relaxed and slow when working customer service, and others were busy and fast paced. The management at Barnes and Noble is very organized, respectful, and flexible. Every one of my co workers were incredibly helpful and kind, especially when I first arrived and was struggling to get into the swing of things. I was generally appreciative to be apart of this team."
good,"I loved being a B&N team member. My only complaint is having to push credit card and membership sales. Otherwise, everyone is fun to work with, and who doesn't love working around books?"
good,"I enjoyed working with my teammates and my boss. There were some tense times during busy periods, but overall a good experience. Unfortunately conflict with one coworker, plus the long commute made my decision to leave prematurely."
good,"If you love working with books, B&N is the best place to talk and chat with others with similar interests. However, the pay is rather low and the company prefers not to have full time staff since they don't have to pay them benefits."
good,This has been one of my favorite jobs. I am an avid reader and therefore enjoyed working in a bookstore. The management and the staff worked well with one another. They were flexible with scheduling and willing to work with you on your schedule.
good,Loved coming to work: learning new information each day. Loved to check out books to work on. Culture was fantastic: several marriages came from the Frederick Barnes and Noble.
good,"It is a fast paced environment made possible by hard working employees, leadership from  managers and ever evolving business practices. Seven days a week the store caters to thousands of customers from all over the country and international tourists as well.The traffic of customers may be the most difficult to handle. It is however made easier by the experience possessed by both veteran coworkers and management as well as tools we have to use to cater to each person. Management is active and in constant communication with booksellers giving them the autonomy to handle important tasks throughout the day while still giving exemplary service to any potential customer in need. I have learned new ways to multitask, how to be a professional in even the most strenuous of moments and how to be a more social person with both customers and coworkers."
good,I loved working for this company. I started out as a temp to permanent. There is so much room for higher advancement in this company. I started as a cashier and was advanced to Bookkeeper.
good,"The overall environment in Barnes & Noble is calm and positive. Both the customers and coworkers are very enjoyable to work with. There is a lot to learn, as most employees are trained in multiple different jobs within the store. A typical day fluctuates a lot seeing as customers come and go and holiday season brings more in than usual."
good,This was a very fun job and a great work environment. The staff work together as one and got the job done as needed. The management was helpful and assisted whenever needed.
good,I got this job as a seasonal cashier. I was ask to stay and I became a bookseller. The discount is great. It was hard to not use your whole pay check on books.
good,"Barnes and Noble, although not a great career choice, is a fun and lively place to work. It is a great part time jobs for students and you have the opportunity to learn a lot and make a lot of friends!"
good,"I had an amazing work experience, get chance to learn cutting edge technology and was part of launch team for B&N.com (new website) it was a great experience. Thumbs up for Team B&N"
good,"I love books, working here was alot of fun. The co-workers were the best part. I enjoyed talking with different customers as well on new books/products. The fundraisers and other events that were held in store are a fun change to the everyday pace of work. All in all a great place to work for."
good,"I assisted customers with potential products and purchases, answered inquiries as necessary, conducted internet orders, stacked shelves, answered the phone, and did so much more."
good,"Honestly, it if weren't for the pay I would have stayed with Barnes and Noble. I really loved it! It was fun working with people to find books and my coworkers were all very kind. Even management was pretty relaxed overall with very little micro-managing."
good,Work place challenges you to do your best and improve yourself. I enjoy being able to fix issues that seem unsolvable. Hard work and dedication are rewarded with growth opportunities.
good,"i worked as a cafe server for the cafe, i loved it it was fun learning how to make all those  starbuck drinks and being around all those books was like a dream come true"
good,"Working at Barnes and Noble in Peoria IL has been a great experience, and one I've truly enjoyed.  Our managers are understanding and trustworthy, and the staff is engaging, diverse, kind, and resourceful.  Pay is also fair and usually above minimum wage.  With all of that said, remember that it /is/ a retail job and comes with all that entails as well... BUT it's probably one of the best retail Jobs out there.  I truly love it."
good,Good. Easy. Simple. Laid back. Comfortable. Nice. Beneficial. Convenient. Consistent. Friendly. Experience. Helpful. Worth it. Likable. Recommendable.
good,I worked as the cafe manager at barnes and noble for 3 year and they treated me fairly and paid me well. It was a stressful work environment with the younger children flooding our store so they could get Frappuccinos.
good,"I was only temporary, but this job taught me the basics of serving coffee and pastries, which allowed me to make advancements in this career. The espresso machines are automatic so steaming and pulling shots are simplified, allowing for basic knowledge."
good,"fun place to work at, friendly people surrounded with amazing atmosphere. relaxing type of flow which gives you time to study and focus on your school."
good,"A typical day was either helping out at customer service or register. You learn how to sell and work in a team there. Management was overall good, they usually helped fix problems. It was a nice culture, there was no drama or fighting really in the store. It was very relaxed and enjoyable while working there. I hardly felt stressed. The hardest part was probably selling memberships because of the high cost, but I did enjoy my associates and the feel of the place."
good,"Barnes & Nobles is a very passion driven business. This is a franchise that is dedicated to excellence and doing things the correct way. From booksellers to VPs, everyone is treated with equal respect and dignity. Barnes & Nobles is so dear to me because it helps develop my people skills. WOW customer service is one of the reasons why the franchise does so well."
good,it's been a really long time since I've worked here. All I really remember was that you had to bake some of the food and it was never really busy. It was really relaxed.
good,"I learned a lot about different books. As an employee, you were expected to know all of the best sellers and different genres."
good,Perfect job for someone who is looking for a temporary position as they hire a lot for seasonal positions. They work around your schedule because you get to pick what shifts you would like to take.
good,For media lovers this is a good job to recommend your favorite things to up-sell. Basic skills are required for cashiering and organizing but overall good job.
good,"During the shift you do so many different jobs, you feel so productive! Its a lot of fun I would highly recommend his company to anyone who wants to apply there."
good,"The people I worked with were very friendly, and great to help if you needed an extra hand. The management was wonderful. I would recommend working here to any of my friends."
good,Easily the best place I've worked. Great management. takes a while to advance. Love the discount. Love the flexibility of hours. Decent allowance of vacation and sick time. The rest of the benefits could be considered mediocre at best.
good,It's a useful workplace for students looking for a job that is flexible with class schedules. Unfortunately the college bookstores are mostly seasonal jobs and not consistently busy throughout the year.
good,Here is where I helped people find books and help expand the knowledge in literature. In a typical day I organized and helped maintain a clean and fun reading environment.
good,"Greet customers, customer service, cash management, stocking, phone call service, locating and organizing store merchandise, promoting / selling memberships"
good,"They train their associates real well in all sections of the company. From the coffee shop, to sales associate, to working the registers. They were always willing to work with your schedule."
good,"I loved how I could go off to school and give a call and be able to work on my school breaks. My direct supervisor was amazing and friendly, whereas other supervisors in the department weren't as such. Working as a cashier, it was nice having the friendly banter between the other cashiers and they honestly became my friends and I enjoyed working here because of the mutual friendships with the other cashiers."
good,"Fun atmosphere, easy-going customer base. Can be a rewarding sales job.  Book knowledge is a plus.  Barnes & Noble continues to successfully reinvent themselves.  They not only carry books, but a great selection of DVD, Bluray, vinyl records, Toys/games/puzzles.  They also have a great selection for kids such as plush, activity books, Lego, and activity kits."
good,Barnes and Noble Education is a great place to work.  The people are outstanding. The management were approachable and always open to listening to any issues you may have.  It is truly a place where employees come first.
good,Barnes and Noble was my first ever job. I loved it there and the majority of the people. I liked being able to see the new titles coming out and the discounts we're awesome.
good,"The staff in the stores holds more degrees than most professional office positions that I have held.  They are knowledgable and each has their own areas of expertise.  They are always willing to help new staff."
good,a typical day at work would be making coffee orders for customers and students.  the job is not stressful and you have fun doing  coffee and food orders.
good,It was pretty cool to work there on campus. I only worked there for a short time due to it being a seasonal job. Overall though it was a good job for a college student.
good,I love books and the smell of coffee which made for a perfect place to work for me! I loved the management and everyone is so friendly. I don't know how easy is to move up in the company cause it was just a part time seasonal job for me!
good,"Good place to work, friendly, where you work a variety of different tasks...customer service ,cashiering, shelving, and returns. In fact the Barnes&Noble has instruction manuals for every task and positions in the store. The hardest part of the job upselling customers who don't know what they want.Customers who get the titles wrong,and think they know where the books they want are located and refuse your help."
good,"The employees that trained me were helpful and dedicated. They made sure my questions were answered. If I made mistakes, they didn't punish me for it."
good,Managment was good but work hours were restricted so always busy and short of hours. Got to have free books and a lending program to read books. Need to have real customer service and human resources skills as often as a manager you will spend many hours as the only manager so breaks and lunches can be resticted to certain times.
good,"I have been with the company for almost 10 years, and in this time have seen it go through many changes. It is a retail business, and as such there is a strong focus on customer service and sales. It is a good job for someone who can remain upbeat and positive, no matter the situation. Like many retail companies, there is a lot to do, and every year there is less and less time to do it. Overall, it is a decent company to work for with good compensation."
good,The Barnes and Noble warehouse is a good place to work due to the friendly management and co-workers. It was also a good experience because of the many different jobs that i was introduced to.
good,"I enjoyed in working in Barnes and Noble Distribution Center, Monroe township NJ as picker and I learn so many things from my coworkers and supervisors. I miss my coworkers and friends. More than two three occasions we enjoy together as Barnes and Noble Family outside as well inside the  huge building. I also learns to drive forklift."
good,"This is a great place to work for, good benefits/discounts, open minded company, flexible work schedule. Management is good. They try to have schedules out 2 weeks in advance which is nice. The hardest part of the job is making sure you get enough hours for yourself."
good,"Barnes and Noble has been a great company to work for - although like most retail companies is undergoing some market stress at the moment.  This sometimes means there are a lot of changes coming in the pipeline and you have to react quickly and accept change."
good,"The general environment at Barnes is fantastic, I loved working there, especially in the café. Though, from what I've seen as of late, it has gone down a bit. The old store manager was much better, though the current one isn't horrible. Over all, I would definitely recommend it."
good,"The typical work day includes answering phones, providing excellent customer service, and ringing customers up using fast cashiering. If you are fond of books, movies, and music you'll fit right in."
good,"worked in the Barnes  & Nobles book store as a cashier, stock sales Helping students fine the proper books for their classes.  Help to set up lunches for everyone."
good,"Fun environment as you are in a college bookstore setting where you are in constant contact with faculty, staff and students.  You get to order unique fun school spirit merchandise for that particular campus you are managing."
good,"Great place to work, great environment, learned everyday on then job, management is great, benefits are top class with health insurance, sick days, and vacation."
good,"A typical day is making coffee, cappuccino and cookies as well as interacting with our customers. Of course keeping the cafe' stocked and clean per guidelines"
good,"making holds, answering phones, suggesting books to customers, helping guest find what they need, cash register, organizing and shelving books"
good,"I received a lot of hands on training for this job, as I worked in several departments; trade books, cashier, Starbuck's cafe, and in the Stadium store, as it was a campus location."
good,"Top rated employer for LGBT folks. "
good,I enjoyed working here even though it was a temporary job. The workers there all got along. When it got really busy we all did our part in making sure things moved smoothly. management was kind of tuff but not to bad.
good,My training was thorough and well managed. It was a pretty relaxed environment even when busy. The benefits that came with the position were wonderful as well.
good,The people there were great and it was a nice environment. I enjoyed working there Its fast paced depending on the cafe you work in but its also slow at times theres a lot of work to be done.
good,This is a great company to work for. They really take care of there employees and appreciate the people who work for them. I wish the pay was a little more or I would still be there.
good,Good company to work for as a part time bookseller to get you through school At a store level the atmosphere is very good and supportive. I would recommend this company to anyone who is a fan of books and connecting with other readers.
good,"Working at Barnes & Noble was a good job. The staff was very intelligent, loved books and music, and most of the management was great. When our district changed, so did the whole store. Our new District Manager was used to small stores in large cities, so our hours were cut, and we went from the top of our previous division in sales to the bottom of our new division. I, personally, had all hours cut besides my own in Receiving, while still getting enough inventory to need those hours."
good,"I enjoy working around books and people who enjoy them, but management is majorly on edge, I assume because of the holidays. A typical day at work consists of showing up, putting your stuff up back, going up front to punch in, then letting the MOD know you are there. From there you go to your post. No food, only water in a capped bottle(per all registered establishments), and no cell phones. The customers can be a handful at times, some even down right rude no matter what you do, but there are always one or two that make the day worth it. The seasonal workers should be given a better heads up on when they are to be let go, so they have more time to get a different job. Nothing sucks more in today's economy than not having any warning when your job is going to end."
good,"I worked here for seven years so I was able to learn about every department and I very much enjoyed my time at Barnes & Noble. I had awesome co-workers and was able to meet some wonderful people. I loved that the company offers benefits to their employees. Of course the hardest part of the job was the constant cutting of hours and having a skeleton crew, but management was great and we always seemed to make it work."
good,"It has all the perks a bookstore would have but a lot of the monopoly and issues that a retail store has. Unfortunately majority if the job is selling memberships but the people you work with are amazing (for the most part) and the management is calm and understanding. The hours a relatively long and can be tiring. There are times where you may work well into the night and then come in early the next day. the pay is weekly so thats nice, but the hours are usually random considering it being retail. The lunch is an hour for a full day and there are always lots of fun events."
good,Staff and Management were great to work with. All employees kept the work place clean which in my opinion is wonderful. I love working in clean spaces !
good,Working at a college bookstore can be a love hate relationship at times but as long as you love your job and love the people you're doing it with you will have an overall great experience
good,"Co-workers provide a great environment, and are constantly helping you with whatever you need. Management is pretty flexible, and a lot of employees have worked there for years. On the flip side, we have bad turn around times due to lack of hours. Not a fan of the credit card and member card pressure put on by corporate."
good,"I was sent out to the Delano location where I was left in charge of almost everything. Opening and closing the small text book store,counting the money in safe, and handling any problem presented. "
good,"Being a reader, I enjoyed working with books and the people who read them, both employees and customers.  In addition to being the Digital Sales Lead, I primarily worked the Customer Service desk, dealing with people both in the store and over the phone.  This involved helping people find the books and other merchandise they were looking for, and often just helping them to determine which book, or item, they actually needed.  Since I like helping people, working Customer Service was for me very enjoyable.  Ironically, it could also be the worst part of the job, as anyone who has dealt extensively with the public can attest.  Some people just can't be pleased, no matter what you do for them.  When I came into this job, I already had extensive book knowledge, both from my own reading and from having worked in the business once before for nine years.  I did learn a lot, though, both about new authors I had not known before, and about he book business in general.  The management at my store was generally quite good, both in terms of knowledge and in managerial ability."
good,"Management works 40-45 hours a week, in a generally low-pressure environment.  Loving the products you sell helps, as you and your team are there to provide suggestions and generate loyalty.  Generally attract a more educated team and enjoy my coworkers and management.  Definitely becoming more sales oriented than service."
good,Good place to work at if you love books. The store is a little demanding but not so much as any other place with retail.I loove the people and the emviorement.
good,Barnes & Noble has a nice ambient atmosphere which is great for reading and even working on your computer. The employee discount is nice as well due to the significant percentage one receives off. My coworkers are hardworking and motivated people.
good,"Barnes & Noble can be a fast-paced but exciting place to work. No matter which department you work in on a given day, you're likely to be very productive and hard at work, but it is not overwhelming. The building has a calming but professional atmosphere at all times, and the management is fantastic at keeping everything in check and fully functional. They are also human, and listen to the needs and complaints of their employees and strive to provide the best environment for everybody. It is very rewarding helping people find what they are looking for and have a smile on their face."
good,"Great people with a ""can do"" attitude.  I have really enjoyed working here and have learned a lot about subcontract manufacturing."
good,"Barnes & Noble was somewhere I really felt at home. I was surrounded by mediums in which I spent a great deal of my free time, and as such was able to translate my interest into helpful and useful service to our customers. I made many friends and learned a lot from those I worked with, and each shift presented an exciting and promising opportunity to share what I love with those I encountered."
good,"A typical day included customer service and merchandise flow management. I learned that there is a lot more to books than just enjoying reading! The team is definitely a family and they care about each other. Not coming from a book background, the hardest part of the job was learning all the subcategories and the life of a book, but working with other book lovers and customers was definitely rewarding!"
good,I have had a great time working here. the people are friendly and the customers are great.day to day the work life has been a great learning experience for me.
good,Wonderful starter opportunity for employees to learn about customer service in a fast-paced retail environment. Work is exciting and fulfilling.
good,I had good time working with them it was nice place to work. like my co-worker and had no problems with management. enjoy helping people looking for what they need.
good,"Helped customers find book's that they need and answered any questions that they have. I also re-shelved book's that were misplaced, organized the front of the store, and ordered book's for customers."
good,"You work a varied schedule, just like any retail job. The pay is expected for the work you do, but the people around you are what makes this place a great company to work for."
good,"Overall my experience was decent working for the company. Many of my  co-workers were kind helpful and inclusive. They often went out of their way to make sure I was fully prepared and helped when I was in need. As a full-time, student management was accommodating with my schedule for the most part but because my particular store was very busy and understaffed it made it difficult to balance our schedules. Not having enough employees can make the work environment a tad hectic but overall a great place to work especially if you are starting out."
good,"Great atmosphere, Excellent discounts, wonderful co-workers. I really enjoyed my time here, wish my seasonal employment had become FT, but I enjoyed the 2 years I had working seasonal."
good,"I would definitely loved to work at Barns & Noble again, it was an amazing learning experience and actually gave me the experience I needed in many different job fields, I owe a lot to this job."
good,"This is a nice place to work at. Very nice environment, the employees are very cordial. Employees try to make the  best out of each shift. the hours were flexible. Overall a good place to work at."
good,"A typical work day would be that, its sometimes busy. I think because I work in this kids department, Its very fast pace and I think that I learned that I have be organized with my time and how effective I am with taking orders and listening carefully. Management is great, they lead is to victory and they are always on call when you and a customer needs help and that's the same with my co workers, they are very helpful. the hardest part of the job would be that sometimes you have to take on more than 5 tasks at time because the business is so busy but its very fun to experience and learn and that's also the enjoyable part, I like that the customers are trusting me with helping them."
good,It was a fun time being able to work with coworkers who became such good friends and to still be able to provide a wonderful customer experience.
good,"great dynamics with management and teams. They work with your schedule and provide flexibility needed when full time student. Fun place to work, Learned a great deal regarding retail sales."
good,Fun work!  I always enjoyed my time here.  Always pleasant environment and busy work.  Clients were fun to talk to. Company Culture is great.
good,This was my most intellectual job I had. I was surrounded by a wealth of information and there were so many intelligent people. That includes customer and staff. My only regret was me not staying on.
good,"Food is amazing, always busy, always productive atmosphere, but management needs work. Great job for college students."
good,This is a place where you can enjoy your job on a daily basis. Nice work envoronment and good people. The only downside is te salary. If you have a family and are not at a top level position it is tough to live comfortably.
good,So much better than my old job. Management cares about their employee and employees are amazing! Haven't had much experience with the company yet
good,"Great customers, fun coworkers, ever changing environment, and wonderful to work with fun product everyday.  There is always something to keep you busy even when the traffic is slow."
good,"Training is very thorough and they don't have any problem answering questions although some management is a little iffy but mostly really good at doing their jobs and helping us do ours.  The customers are the hardest part of the job.  Helping customers find books that they may not even know the title of or the author, trying to suggest toys or books for the customer while going off of very little information, and dealing with many stressful situations. But the events we have are really fun and I get along with almost all of my coworkers.  The actual job is not very hard, just a lot of busy work.  The customers make it challenging, but the more you deal with the more experience you have and the better you get at it."
good,"Nice and quiet work place supportive management."
good,"i love working under that management"
good,"Team mentality and a supportive home office"
good,"•	Assist customer to their class textbooks"
good,The atmosphere is quiet and professional. Opportunities to learn many different skills. The employee discount is awesome!
good,"I worked part time. Love this job!"
good,Barnes and Noble College is a great company to work for because it takes care of its employees and promotes those who work hard.
good,The staff is mostly full of people who enjoy the environment of a bookstore and cafe. One of the best perks of this job would be the customers who frequent the store and never cease to put a smile on your face.
good,I liked working here at that time. I got along with most co-workers. Management was good. I did my job well when I was there.
good,"Cleaning book shelves, Assisting customers with finding their books.   Helping managers with daily activities such as prepping the store for an event. The only hard part about the job was remembering where everything exactly is."
good,This job will allow you to interact with many people. Make sure you have the customer service skills required. You will also need a good work mentality because it does get stressful at times.
good,"Seniority is very important. If you havent worked there long, you will barley get hours."
good,Nothing bad to say. I loved working here and the co workers are amazing.
good,"Managers were great, very accommodating; each one willing to take the time to make sure each employee was on top of everything and doing great.  Co-workers were always friendly, willing to help each other out."
good,"We have a passionate staff dedicated to helping our customers. With the ever-changing environment in the book world, we are doing well as a company. My schedule and work times vary and I find the time to work with booksellers and keep in touch with educators and corporate clients.  I manage all of the Business development programs including bookdrive, institutional sales, educator sales, and the bookfair program. I am also a district mentor for other assistant managers who oversee these programs. I help with all of the hiring and staffing choices, and assist with orientations and new hire paperwork. I completed the Human Resources certification program to help me with employee relations.  I was inspired to become a better manager and help other booksellers. The hardest part of my current position is time.  My schedule always varies and I have to find the time to keep up my contacts, schedule meetings, conduct outreach, as well as run a business."
good,"Work with fellow employees, and find out what's most needed."
good,"Everyday I'm challenged with different variables that either impede or accelerate my workload depending on how I use them. I've learned the best methods in prioritizing and time management when it comes to both my daily workload and looking down the line. My management team is supportive and have taught me how to delegate tasks with respect to the amount of people we have working versus how many departments need to be refilled with product. "
good,"This company is generally good to work for. Their hours are fair, the business is good, and the staff are typically supportive."
good,"-Very stable and flexible job for college students"
good,I have to learned to be curious and understanding to customers needs. The management team are great and eager to teach new associates. One of the hardest parts of my job is when we don' t have what the customer needs or when a customer gets upset because they didn't like how they were treated but one of my associates. I take customer service very serious and love when I able to make the customer/employees happy.
good,This company focuses on exceeding a customer's expectation of customer service.
good,This is a great place to work. The company is very helpful  and willing to work with you.
good,Love the communication and staff. The atmosphere is really quiet and you can help people as they come into the store. It's very casual and not stressful at all. I recommend anyone to work for this company.
good,Loved being part of a team working to promote reading and literacy in our community.
good,Great people and environment. Learned the Cashier and bookkeeping
good,"Working with customers on a daily basis and working in every aspect of the store. There was always more to learn and new things to do which was always exciting, and a new challenge to take on. It was a great work environment with good co-workers and managers."
good,Very good work environment overall. Not a great management with clear technical vision.
good,"On a typical day you start out by making sure everything is prepped. That means setting not only yourself, but everyone else that comes in after you, up for success. In the mornings we normally get ""the regulars"", the people who want to come in, sit down, enjoy a cup of coffee and start their day off relaxed. Towards the afternoon is when things really start to get moving and fast paced. You have to stay on your toes when it comes to the lunch crowd (which is where making sure you have everything prepped in the morning comes in handy). It can get hectic and a bit overwhelming at times seeing as how there is only one cafe server at a time in the cafe; but there is always someone in the store who is cafe trained that you can call for backup. At night you have to balance helping customers with getting everything ready for close. We've been very lucky in the sense that everyone here at Barnes and Noble is extremely easy to work with. It feels like you're working with your friends, because you are. The hardest part about working on the book floor is working with customers to try to find the book they want when the customer has no clue who the author is or the title of the book...but they do know the book's color. The most enjoyable and rewarding part about working at Barnes and Noble is seeing the customers face after you've handed them the book they've been dying to read, or getting a customer who walked in with a frown to smile after they've taken a sip of the coffee drink you've prepared them. Sometimes it's the little things in life that make it worth living."
good,its a great place to work at and also the community it a good place.
good,"I enjoyed working here. I learned in two years how to provide exceptional customer service while moving at a specific space at the same time. Lots of times it was required to move fast, especially around the holidays, and I did well. I learned how to sell memberships and get renewals and I did well there as well. It got tough at times, very tough, but I pulled through. I had a lot of lovely co-workers. I learned how overall people could be and how to handle it. I learned a lot from this job and am very grateful to have had this experience."
good,"The hardest part is selling the membership and dealing with lousy customers. The membership is barely worth it and nobody ever wants to pay $25 for it, but the company tracks the percentage of how many you sell. They base how well you do your job by how many memberships you sell."
good,"If you love books, this is the place to be.  Almost everyone that works there loves to read and be surrounded by books."
good,This was my first job directly out of college and I have found it to be a very positive experience!
good,"The first and last two weeks of the semester are the busiest, and you are more likely to get a solid 40+ hour week during these times. In between those times, you are lucky if you can pull off 20 unless you are brought on as full time. I have been there through 2 manager changes (a third one is occurring in early March 2014). The current manager is very nice to work with and will go out of her way to make sure you enjoy the working environment."
good,"The hardest part of the job is when there are policies in place we are told to follow but then some people choose to follow them and others back down as soon as a customer starts to get upset. What is the point of having policies if we don't care to follow them? And it makes me look like a big jerk for trying to look out for the company. Yes, there are and should be exceptions, but just because a customer comes in acting like a two-year old doesn't mean we should give in. I don't want to wait on anyone like that again and honestly are policies are not unreasonable. The funnest part is that they encourage us to have relationships with the customers in the sense that it is ok to talk to them and take our time with them. Such a nice feeling to not have to look at them like just another dollar sign!"
good,"Good place to work, good management and work culture. Friendly atmosphere."
good,A typical day would be helping customers find books they need  and ringing up their purchases.
good,Working at Barnes and Noble is like working for your family. Everyone is really close with is awesome. Sometimes people can become too personal with eac hother though and that is where the hard management decisions may be comromised.
good,"-the people in management are great people, sometimes forgetful "
good,"Aside from tasks I'm given through e-planner I'm left to work at my own pace. The managers will check in every now and then to see if I need anything (extra help, questions, potty break, etc.), but aside from that I'm left alone. Management is very understanding and flexible; if you have a family emergency or something critical going on, they'll be willing to find someone to cover for you until you come back. My co-workers are fun to talk to and I've made a majority of the friends I have now just by working at Barnes & Noble."
good,"When I started working in Barnes and Nobles I was in the Cash register first. I was always in top by selling the customer the  Membership. In about two month's I started training employees and showing them how to get membership. In a few months, I started to notice what I was good at. Helping customer when they have difficultly with their device. From there I Start working in the Nook section not only because I was helping customer troubleshooting. I was also helping customer to find the right device for them. I grew more working in Barnes and Nobles that I became working in Customer Service as a bookkeeper. I help customers  to find their own book, and place the book in their hand. I also look up for the book and if we didn't had it in our store. I would find other suggestion, till I fine that the customer is satisfied. I am a hard working, and I always did my job right. But the most thing I did help the customer, by giving them respect all the time. Make them well Welcome, with a Joyful smile I always bring in my job. I never show the customer my attitude, always gave them a smile, and always friendly. I love that the customer remember me and know my name. When they come to the store, they make sure they say hi and bye to me before they leave. The most enjoyable that the customer do, they always help me. There was a great customer I had, that just because I help her, she told me she could do my hair for free. She work in a salon around the corner by my job. There are also customer that I see them out from my job, and they still remember me. Those are the enjoyable memories,"
good,Very family oriented but the pay isn't enough to support yourself on.
good,A typical day at work was helping customers find books and ring up customers.
good,"A typical day at work for me is getting in at 9:30 most mornings and working with parents and children and deciphering the type of books and activities the kids like to read and participate in. It keeps me on my toes. I work closely with management when planning placement of books on the trade floor and with the receiving manager on getting product out in quick and efficient manner. The hardest part of my job is normally the beginning of the month when all product fixtures change and new product is to be arranged. A normal switch is about 30-45 different projects. However, I look forward to the challenge and it feels great when I mark off the last project off the list."
good,"•	Configuration of Business process in SAP FI/CO (ECC 6.0) to enable integration between various functionalities in a cross functional team"
good,"A great place to learn better the absolute fun and excitement of working in the malls in Los Angeles and San Diego."
good,I enjoyed working at Barnes and Noble even though its retail. The store manager was nice as well as the co-workers.
good,"I held several positions while working there at company. No matter what department I was in, I had fun and enjoyed working."
good,I enjoy working for this company. The management team and co-workers are a joy to be around.
good,"•	a typical day at work"
good,"I loved working with customers, authors ... maintaining store operations  book floor, music and café , overseeing summer reading programs, book clubs"
good,Mixed work environment. Consists of a lot of interaction with new people on a daily basis. A typical day at work could be fast or slow. I've learned more about how to make customers feel at home . The management is awesome and gives you flexibility with your work schedule. Overall the job is easy going once you get the hang of the orders and all of the procedures.
good,This was a good company to work for. Kind of hectic but you get the chance to improve your customer service skills.
good,"I like working for the bookstore. I got the opportunity to meet many author that would have their book signing at B&N. I enjoy reading all the new books that came out. I was a bookseller, so I would fill the sleeves with new and old product. I would make book orders for customers that came into the store. I got along with everyone that work there. It was a fun place to work at. "
good,"fast pace , very productive you leadrned something new daily a large mass of people "
good,"- Created a safe work environment"
good,Great place to work. Hired as a lead bookseller because of my degree in literature. 
good,I was cashier or customer service.  I loved helping and  being around  the customers.  I also stocked shelves and reorganized areas.  Working at the Nook counter was challenging and rewarding.
good,"This was my first job and i overall enjoyed it. I was only employed temporarily for the holiday season because it got really hectic during that time, sometimes it got so busy i felt overwhelmed with so much to do but the managers were always willing to help and i eventually got the in's and out's of the job. I never had a rude customer or a co- worker i didn't get along with. I really enjoyed working for this company and i have nothing but positive reviews for it."
good,"This is a good company that I think anyone would like,  I think they have a good reputation "
good,"My work day consisted of receiving the daily shipments, sorting the product and staging it to be shelved on the sales floor the following morning. I had excellent coworkers and management team. The most difficult part of the job was lack of hours for assistence yet it kept me busy at all times so I enjoyed that."
good,"There is a good variety of work to be done from shelving in the morning to display maintenance, planning for Children's Storytime, customer service and more that a shift is hardly ever boring. The management at this location is the best group of people I have ever worked with. They are a very professional group for ""just"" a retail store. They encourage employees to have high work standards and are good at praising a job well done."
good,"A typical day at work includes making drinks, food, and taking orders from customers to give them the best coffee shop experience possible. I learned how to be a leader by taking on the responsibilities of the Cafe Lead for a year, though I could not take the position formally because of time restrains brought on by school."
good,"A typical day at work is helping customers locate books, organize the book floor, operate cash register, and answering phone calls. I have learned how to deal with difficult customers and also how to satisfy each customer. I have gained interpersonal and organizational skills. Both my managers and co workers are very comforting and helping whenever I need them. The hardest part of the job is maintaining the store clean and picking up after everyone's mess. The most enjoyable part of my job is making customers happy and satisfied."
good,The work environment seemed great to me but I worked in the receiving area which was low stress. It was busy and lightly physical but low stress.
good,A typical day at work changes from day to day and that is what makes it great.
good,Barnes and Noble provides booksellers with a place to advance both their careers as well as make life ling friendships.
good,Working at a bookstore I had to do things twice or more when dealing with management. Management always was changing and alternating the environment constantly. The enjoyable part was dealing with customers.
good,"A typical day at work would be shelving some books and helping out customers throughout the store. I've learned alot of different things working at this job which is why I enjoy it. You gain a lot of experience working here because you get trained in many different parts of the store. I was trained in cafe, on the register, and general customer service. Not many places can give you that much experiencee. The management is very friendly and easy to talk to which makes it an amazing work enviorment. The hardest part of the job is probably during the holidays and you have to deal with irrate customers who need their books as gifts. We deal with this often and must keep calm and stay polite. It definitely has taught me as well as my coworkers patience."
good,"A typical day at Barnes & Noble would involve looking at the schedule to see what projects I am to complete during my shift. The day is divided into 1 hour incriments, with most of my time spend at the cash wrap area of the store. I ring up the customers purchases, call customers when their orders arrive into the store, and enter customer information in the computer. I train any new hirees on proper cash handling. I discuss any new issues or promotions with fellow booksellers as they come to the cash wrap area. Assisting any fellow booksellers with problems involving cash register proceedures and customer returns and taking cash pickups to the cash office are other important aspects of my day. Setting up and straightening displays in the gift department and the front of the store are also my responsibilities."
good,What I like most about this job is that you help someone out and they get out from the store happy that they will return back there again.
good,"Great company to work for. Best part of the job was interacting with the public. Hardest part of the job, working during the holiday rush. Most enjoyable part of the job, working events and corporate functions."
good,"I loved the managers, especially the cafe one that was over me."
good,Good place to work. The employees will make sure that you are set up for success.
good,This company does a great job at making sure you are set up for success.
good,Worked in several departments of Barnes & Noble. Run like a typical large retailer. The management staff and the time was great as were the coworkers. Hardest part of the job for me was dealing with some of the issues between coworkers. Nice environment to work on the whole.
good,"Most of the time it was enjoyable. We would open the store, stock the shleves, answer questions for new releases and current best sellers, then close, sweep/vacuum, and leave. The managers always listened but it was hard to inact changes being such a large company. My coworkers worked hard and were always willing to do projects and take constructive criticism. That being said, it was still a retail job at Christmas which is never fun, but the teamwork there made it easier, and I learned to enjoy the challenge of the Christmas rush. The best part of the job is we received 30% off books, could check out new releases in hard-back, and got free books from the returns under certain conditions!"
good,Spent time learning the ins and outs of a college bookstore while helping students with their daily needs!
good,"During my time working in the cafe, I often had to either open or close the cafe. When I had to open, my responsibilities included accepting and putting away the weekly milk order; as well as brewing the coffees, hot tea, and iced teas and coffees. Although I normally only had about an hour to open up with a decent amount to do, I was all ready for my morning customers."
good,Barnes & Noble provided a friendly work environment on a daily basis. Management was always around to assist with any inquiry or concerns that the CSR may have had.
good,"Overall a good place to start out at, Barnes and Noble provides a good and supportive atmosphere. However, the pay starting out is not enough to live off, but enough for a teen who just wants some spending money. Moving up is difficult as the only way to is to wait until the person ahead of you either leaves or gets a higher position. This rarely happens."
good,A typical day consists of helping customers find the right books needed for their classes.
good,"Working for this company has proven to be extemely beneficial for me over the past few years as an emerging writer and graduate student. The best part of the job, for me is being able to see what new titles from my favorite authors are being published the very day of their release. All of my co-workers are fun and pleasant-natured. They are always willing to lend a helping hand whenever I am feeling overwhelmed with a project or when I need to ask a question. I have been working for this company for nearly three years, and there are still questions that I have to ask my supervisors every once in a while. There is always something to learn about as an employee in a bookstore. My favorite activities at work are helping customers find a particular book because it grants me an opportunity to make suggestions, granting me the feeling of providing them with an invaluable service to their shopping experience. The most difficult part of the job is working the cash register, mostly because you are not allowed to leave the cramped space for hours at a time. I also do not like peddling Nooks to customers. We do not work on commission, so there is no incentive for employees to go out of their way to sell these devices. Also, I believe that by now, most of the general consumer population has heard about the e-reader devices, and can make their decision on their own whether they want to convert their reading experience to one or continue to read the old- fashioned way."
good,"Overall, I loved working for this company. It was a store at a local community college, so we only sold textbooks. I was only there for the 'rush periods', the periods of enrollment or students using their Financial Aid. I learned a great deal about team work and mostly how to satisfy an unhappy customer. There was nothing hard about the job, I loved it."
good,I love working here during the buyback seasons/ winter vacations!
good,"I left this company becuase I had to move, or I would have happily stayed. Great company culture with very good compensation (especially for retail). If you like books and cds/dvds, you'd love it here, as long as you can deal with the fact that it is retail."
good,"I worked at the towson, MD across from the mall~ it was fun and I learned allot literature and good read's. The only problem is some of the staff did not know how to speak to other's. But, other then that fun environment."
good,"I worked at Barnes & Noble for three years and loved it. There are so many perks available to book loving employees. They were very accommodating to my students schedule. My manager was a great guy and my co-workers were always very nice. The only real complaints I had were: fewer hours towards the end of my stint there, and after three years my wages only went up $1."
good,"The company is good, its pay scale is always a beat behind other retail in the area but acceptable. Managers are generally supportive and help you succeed in growing in your position. "
good,"For a long time after getting my degree in literature, I was searching for a job that could make use of that degree, and when I received the call for the interview, I was ecstatic at the chance to be able to do exactly that. I am thankful every day for this opportunity to do something on a regular basis that I have an actual interest in."
good,I helped customers who needed help finding certain books and assist them with any questions they might have. I also did restock for the new books that were being brought in.
good,"Yes, its a bookstore, aside from being a retail store. However, things will flow much more smoothly for you if you have a knowledge of books. If you don't, working here will help you improve that knowledge. This job also requires patience: you will encounter many people who may not know what they're looking for, and you'll need to exercise your listening skills to help them. I was fortunate to work with a great staff of people, which made all the difference."
good,"I enjoyed this job for the most part. I loved the people I worked with, and all of the special events we did. It was definitely stressful a lot with moving everything around constantly and being on a strict schedule. But I would go back just as a part time bookseller instead of a lead. The worst part about this job was corporate, but now that they have been bought out, hopefully that will be better."
good,"While working here, my job was to keep the area clean and presentable to customers, i enjoyed the co-workers there, they were kind, energetic and helpful."
good,"BARNES & NOBLE iS best As a Bookseller, you are responsible for selling by providing exceptional customer service through our four core service principles. You make the shopping experience interactive and engaging by"
good,"My time at Barnes & Noble was a lot of fun, and the compensation was competitive. Management was difficult at times, but everyone is on the same team, and rooting for your accomplishments."
good,"All of the other team members were so welcoming and everybody watches out for one another and helps one another out. Compared to previous places I've worked at, the communication there is awesome. The managers listen to you and my department manager was always looking for ways to improve both as a team and as a manager. I would definitely recommend working here to someone. The only thing I would change would be the pay."
good,"I love going to work! I have so much fun with my co-workers, while we get lots of hard work done. We also get rewarded for the hard work we do with free meals, employee appreciation, and free drinks in the cafe!"
good,I became apart of the Barnes and Noble team while I was a college student. The hours were flexible and I could rearrange them around my class schedule
good,"I loved my time at Barnes and Noble. The managers were amazing: warm, approachable, open about their expectations. The pay wasn't phenomenal, but its what you would expect for a starting position in a company. Great coworkers and an enjoyable experience getting to interact with customers."
good,"If you need a seasonal position, great and relaxed place to work. Co-workers were friendly and the higher ups were understanding. 50% discount at the on-site Starbucks was a huge plus."
good,"The best part about the job was being able to meet new people and learning about there interest. A typical day at work would consist of providing customer service to customers, by helping them look for a specific book or genre or having to order a book for them online and organizing the store making sure it looked presentable."
good,"The role is an average business management role. Maintain inventory and the facility. Hire, train and coach staff. Focused on customer service, sales and business growth. Management team in the few stores I have worked is a mix of good, high caliber people that care about the staff and the business and are a joy to work with, others are a nightmare. The teams I have worked with have been great. Customers are generally pretty easy going and you can have great conversations and build great sales."
good,I love to be around books and to recommend books to customers. The fellow employees were amazing to work with. I learned a lot about how to interact with customers.
good,Typical day at work was getting all the items packed and correct. Importance was to make sure the tag matched the number of items. I have learned how to work in a fast paced environment and how to manage how to get everything done in an orderly fashion. Management was very helpful and would make sure we were always busy. Workplace culture was difficult to connect with at first because most workers could only speak spanish but they were very helpful in trying to teach me what to do. Hardest part of the job was feeling unwelcome. I enjoyed being able to do more than one task and learning how to do other jobs there.
good,"A typical work day is filled with interesting new faces, along with many opportunities to learn new things and to better yourself as an employee. The hardest part is learning recipes for the beverages but with practice, it becomes second nature."
good,"I've only been with Barnes and Noble for a few months now but I feel this has been enough time for me to get a fair assessment of the atmosphere at least. Coworkers and management are great and get along well with each other. Everyone is seen as equally important. Coworkers often hang out outside of work and actually enjoy each other's company! I would best describe this as being a family atmosphere because everyone is very supportive of one another and everyone is very important."
good,"A typical day at Barnes and Noble consists of assisting customers, pushing product out on the floor, and practicing habits that increase sales. The hardest part is the temporary stress of feeling overwhelmed when you're busy, but the wave passes quickly."
good,"Great place to work. There's an awesome management and bookseller team and of course a great discount for employees. It's a stressful job during the holiday season and when we get a lot of projects, but other than that it's a great place to work and get started with a professional career."
good,"I work part-time at Barnes and Noble. It is a quick-paced job, and you have to be able to multi-task. I worked in management for 7 years, and decided to go back to school to get my degree. I now work part-time and enjoy it."
good,"Overall, a positive experience. There is always work to be done. The management is serious about their jobs. They're also extremely nice, understanding, personable people."
good,"Great benefit package, excellent job culture. A lot of readjustment trough the company, and high turnover due to changes."
good,"I absolutely love working at Barnes and Noble, the only downside is, its a dying company. There are a few Barnes and Noble that will still for a couple more years but unfortunately the store I am currently working at, will not. It is a great if you're looking for something temporary and put on your resume."
good,"A wonderful company to work for, generally attracting intelligent, hardworking and cultured individuals. Unfortunately, as with all retail, the E-commerce giant looms over this great company."
good,"Barnes & Noble has a great work culture. I learned a lot about leadership, giving great customer service and working great as a team.Recent layoffs of fulltime positions though make things more erratic"
good,"Barnes and Noble was a great company to work for when I started almost 12 years ago. But over the past 4 years there has been a stay decline in direction and leadership. So much so that in February of this year, the company eliminated 4 different positions and laid off overt 4000 employees. Something I had never witnessed with the company. This was to help save money for a company that had seen a steady decline in sales over this same period. Now there are very few hours for current employees and almost no training for new hires.  There is quite a bit of uncertainty of the direction the company is heading."
good,You gotta have a passion for books and feel comfortable approaching and talking to customers. Additional sales and membership sales are crucial to every store.
good,Great place to work and grow your skills. VP of Engineering hired hard and managed easy respecting SMEs. International travel with team was collaborative and enjoyable.
good,"A typical day at work included merchandising, cashiering, selling Membercards, helping customers find just the right book or gift for their loved one. Management was knowledgeable and supportive. The workplace culture was interactive. The hardest part of the job was not having enough people to help customers and to get the projects done. That is the nature of Retail. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking about books with customers and fellow booksellers. It was an engaging, stimulating environment. I got to meet people from every walk of life. I made good friends with coworkers and customers alike."
good,"i loved working at Barnes and noble. The staff as well as the management team were all amazing and talented human beings. The only reason i ever left was because of the pay but it is standard for a retail part time position. The environment is as relaxed as you could get for retail, with its hiccups now and again. overall i enjoyed my whole time with the company."
good,I loved working and B&N. The hours were flexible--I was able to work multiple jobs and they worked with my schedule. The pay was higher than most retail jobs I'd had. The people were awesome.
good,"Barnes and Noble is a great place to work for a first timer or if you really like a laid back work place. There is a lot of pressure to sell memberships and there is the potential to work very late at night, but it has great people and a great energy for people who love books."
good,"My experience at Barnes & Noble for the most part was very pleasant. The workload standards were very high but manageable. My coworkers and I were so close that I consider them family. I learned so much about the business world, integrity, sales, efficiency, communication and teamwork  in my 15 years there. The management team, myself included, worked great together. We frequently communicated and shared ideas to make our store functional and sales driven, while also making it an extremely positive work place for our staff. I am very grateful for how much Barnes & Noble took care of me during the 15 years of my employment, as well as after my termination."
good,As receiving manager I kept busy all day either processing incoming or outgoing shipments.  The pace varied based on volume but was often challenging yet doable.  There was a nice team spirit and I always knew that help was available if necessary.
good,"Books, movies, music toys & games, coffee, cookies and more. It's fun to talk to customers about the products you love. A great atmosphere to work side by side with other book lovers."
good,"As you would expect from the largest book retailer in the US, Barnes and Noble employees are well-read, pop culture familiar, and friendly. The work environment is generally a quiet one, much like a library, however behind the scenes, planograms and competitive cashier goals foster a sense of haste and ambition. "
good,"Barnes and Noble is an amazing place to work. I mean being surrounded with books? How can you not love that? The coworkers and managers are all lovely people. However various promotions and holidays will cause the tore to be swarmed with large lines and no end in sight. This leads to grumpy customers and can have anxious people tied in knots, and that is why you must be able to keep a level head and a sunny disposition at all times. The pay is minimum wage but that is fair for a barista position, however you can't have a tip jar unlike most baristas. The stress can cause a lot of people to quit their first week. Because of this there is usually lots of opportunities to pick up more shifts. I personally like the fast paced environment it keeps me on my toes."
good,"the college campus bookstore I worked at was very small, the day seemed to drag on, wasn't much for me to do, the people I worked with were fantastic, always got the days I asked for off"
good,"In my time as a bookseller for B&N College, the management and overall job culture have both been beyond amazing. They are flexible to your schedule based on your classes and other occupations or commitments, and the work is fairly easy and sometimes fast paced. However, I don't believe I am paid fairly, simply because of the wide range of responsibilities I have to take care of on a day-to-day basis. Great place to grow comfortable with professionally speaking to people, and becoming familiar with sales operations."
good,"Typically a day consists of filling text book orders, checking in shipped merchandise, stockings shelves and, most importantly, customer service. Working with the customers is one of my favorite aspects of this job. However, it can be challenging when there's not good communication between you and the customer. Such as, the return policy on rental textbooks and other policies."
good,"Barnes and Noble offers a very typical retail work environment. The employees are all nice and helpful. The work goals are always clear and manageable. Sometimes customers can be rude and unreasonable. Also it is often that products get lost. On a whole, it is a nice place to work that offers decent pay, flexible hours, reasonable benefits, and supportive coworker relationships."
good,"A typical work day was slow in traffic but full of many in-store tasks. I learned to stock shelves and merchandising, use the intranet system (including our cash register, daily news, learning tools). Management was light-hearted, but hard-working. Work place culture was friendly and supportive. The hardest part of the job was selling the membership program, which in all reality, was not the most challenging thing one will do. Most enjoyable part of the job was staying up-to-date on all the current media favorites."
good,"Barnes & Noble has an excellent teaching/teamwork culture.  Booksellers learn from one another, questions are frequent and desired.  We work together to create a satisfying experience for our customers and a good atmosphere for each other."
good,"Working in a bookstore in a dream come true for any avid reader. There's daily conversations with customers and coworkers alike of what's new, what's old and holding strong, what special anniversaries are coming up, and so much more. It's an honest joy to work at a place that has such a sense of camaraderie and enthusiasm. I would highly recommend Barnes and Noble to anyone looking for a genuinely interesting and enjoyable experience."
good,"This is a good place to work for a part time job. Having worked at their competitor I would choose Barnes and Noble every time. Typical day includes helping customers, point of sale, and stocking / store recovery. The managers are all pretty good and provide a safe working environment. The hardest part of my job was the requirement to sell memberships at the register. The only problem with it being such a great place to work is that no one ever leaves, which means there is typically no room for advancement. I started here hoping to advance into management as I was in management for years at the competition, however many of the full time managers have been with the company for 5-10 years with no plans on leaving. Unfortunately only managers receive full time and the company has just slashed salary budgets and many positions are being eliminated. All non management employees get 1 to 3 days a week at 4-7 hours per day. This is a good place to work if you need some extra pocket money or have another job / school, but I would not count on it to support yourself."
good,I really enjoyed working for barnes & noble. I worked for one at a college. It was a very easy going job and I learned a lot. Management was nice and understanding. The people i worked with were very kind and welcoming. the hardest part of this job was trying to explain store protocols to parents that felt their children's college books cost too much.
good,"Barnes and Noble is a great place to work with good managers who listen to your needs as well as finding ways to fill their needs.  It is one of the funnest jobs I've ever had, my only downside is that the pay is not very high (it's retail, after all).  If I could make enough for a decent living, I would work for this company forever."
good,"This company really emphasizes taking care of its employees and managers value ensuring their employees have a good work-life balance. However, because the company takes such good care of their employees, there is limited upward mobility without a degree."
good,Lots of Benefits but be sure to stay on top of them. Management needs to work together more cohesively but overall not a bad work experience. Easy going environment
good,The people I work with make the job great. You get 50% off in the cafe and 30% off on the bookfloor. Overall its a pretty chill environment. Most off the time I'm having fun.
good,"Nice company to work for, lots of benefits for employees but hours are limited unless you're a store manager. Starting pay not great but as long as you do your job, there are annual raises. I enjoyed working there but didn't get enough hours."
good,"My job was a Head Cashier. I trained new cashiers, counted drawers and deposit, set up new displays, kept cash register area neat, could override returns. I enjoyed building relationships with the customers and coworkers. There was no negative part about working there."
good,Working at Barnes & Noble was a great experience. The 10 years I worked there was fun and rewarding. The hardest part of the job was watching the book industry collapse after 2008 financial crisis. The best part about being apart of Barnes and Noble was making friends with all of our customers.
good,"I worked at the Barnes and Noble within FIU. Therefore, I would guess that working there is much different than working in an actual Barnes and Noble. It was a typical retail job but surprisingly relaxing. Maybe it is because it was a college store instead of a public store. The workers and customers were nice. pay could have been better but its whatever."
good,I have worked for 3 separate stores and each one was full of great co workers. The culture of BN can not be beat. Corporate doesn't seem to have a handle on day to day tasks but that is all retail stores. The pay is pretty good for a CBDM.
good,I enjoyed working for Barnes and Noble very much. It seemed as if they really cared about all of the employees and had a very good work to personal life ratio. If the company was growing I would definitely still be employed there. Overall great place to work.
good,"B&N is an positive and upstanding company."
good,"As a bookseller, I interact with customers, use the cash registers, and use the computer terminals to search our inventory and place orders. Management is great; they're friendly, helpful, and very supportive of employees. It's a fun place to work, especially when I get to chat with customers or coworkers about our favorite books. Schedules are set a few weeks in advance, and as a part-timer, I can request days off about a month in advance. I don't have a set schedule for the days and shifts I work, and I get to do just about everything, which is great, because working in some departments is monotonous."
good,"This was one of the first jobs I had, and one of the longest, and this job is one that I can come back to because of my time there. While working here, there were some slow days, and the manager is not fond of employees doing nothing, so there were days of random busy work just to be busy. But the trade off is having a job where you can work with the manager and fit your hours into your school schedule and even sometimes receive adjusted hours if you need it to accommodate your studies. Working alongside other students is fun as well because you can make new friends while working there and it greatly improves the experience."
good,"I enjoyed the people I worked with.  Often times there was a lack of communication from upper management which would cause excessive stress on employees.  Work is hard but enjoyable, you are on your feet for long periods of time and sometimes lifting up to 50lbs. You must enjoy working with people, you will interact with customers on a daily basis."
good,"My typical my work day consist of interacting with familiar and new faces. Preparing and serving espresso based drink, coffee, ect. I have learned being a barista is more than a job title; numerous customers have confessed to me that my presences can either make or break their day."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of greeting customers and ringing them up quickly, but politely, engaging them if there was time. Also, I was responsible for filling food and hand-crafted beverage orders. It was also my job to maintain a clean and inviting café by sweeping and wiping down tables. "
good,"Corporate Coffee, serving Starbucks. Fun place to work. Great benefits. Very demanding. It's was awesome to be surrounded with books and music and coffee!"
good,Works around class schedule well. Appreciation of employees is great. Easy work. Great ways to interact with customers. Pay could be better. But overall good place to work for.
good,"This was a solid job. It works really well for college students, but it was not particularly fulfilling for me. They are also good about working with your schedule for school so long as you queue them in  ahead of time."
good,"Corporate puts way too much stress on booksellers to keep a certain average of selling Member cards to people that really don't want them. If 2.5% of transactions with customers that don't already have a member card don't end up getting one, it's cause for a write up. If it goes on too long, it's cause for termination. Booksellers are also now pressured into selling credit cards to every customer plus member cards and gift cards. This creates a lot of tension."
good,"I miss working here... If they had a management job available, I would stay there for the rest of my life."
good,"I walked into my new Barnes and Noble store that I transferred to and realized that I had to reacquaint myself with the map of the store, which I needed to know where each department, product categories and their subcategories are. I already remembered my employee number from my last store, so all I had to do was put my things in my new locker and clock-in. Luckily my manager put me in a department where I knew the job best. From the Music department I could take the time to figure things out on the bookfloor. My co-workers seemed nice and helped me with any questions I had for them. Learning where everything is was difficult for the first couple of shifts but now I can safely say I know how to give a customer great service with my knowledge in the product and placement of the product. The most enjoyable part of my job is speaking to customers about books and being able to hand them the book they requested."
good,"This is a fun place to work at because of the variety of employees it fosters. You learn so much from different people, and understand what makes customer to merchant transactions enjoyable."
good,"I was in charge of the kids ,teen, toys and games, and adult games departments. I had to shelve new stock, restock, put up displays, zoning (scanning books for due outs and out of place books), customer service, and give music their breaks everyday. Plus on friday if working that night do story time. Also helped out with kids store events I loved the kids events and doing story time. It was also fun being the head cashier."
good,"Opening and closing  of the store, training of all new Café staff. Daily operations front paper work, make schedules. Makes all of supply order's for Café."
good,"Getting to meet so many new people a day and work with wonderful management and coworkers is the best part of my job. I enjoy making drinks  -- it lets me use my creativity at work. There can be challenges, as with every job, but the good definitely outweighs the bad."
good,"I've enjoyed working at Barnes & Noble for four years. The management team is customer and employee focused and our store manager does a great job and keeping the job fun. "
good,"This job is good for those who are looking for a simple part-time job for spending money. As a bookseller you assist customers by directing them to their desired books. Cashier skills are necessary but you are given a manual to train from and assistance if needed. The first few days you are scheduled to work you're usually placed at the registers or customer service and you are partnered with someone. Most learn the ropes in roughly three months and this includes the layout of the store, handling customers at customer service and the registers. In my experience the management team ranges from good to excellent. Sometimes as it is with any retail job customers get difficult but you can call for the manager on duty to take care of him/her/them. My customer service skills have advanced greatly in this job. "
good,"Overall, Barnes and Noble was a good place to work. The management was very respectful and considerate to their employees and everyone worked hard as a team."
good,"Nice environment, Good staff. Haven't been working here that long to write a review but so far I like this job."
good,"Co-workers and managers really care about the company, the employees, and the people who shop there."
good,A person starts by putting in their employee code in the system to time in. A new employee is trained for a week with the head cashier in which they are taught how to input memberships and take custom orders. Management promote competition in order to sell a new product an employee would receive a special bonus or benefit. The hardest part of the job is recruiting new membership if the customer purchased books under $25 its hard to convince the customer to become a barnes and noble member. The most enjoyable part of the job if you love reading books all the employee discounts you receive in the store.
good,As a student worker it was understood and abided by that scheduling was based on school.
good,"Usually, a day at work is like no other. At the moment, students are out enjoying the start of their summer break so its pretty slow at the store. During the start of the school semester, it sure gets crazy! You have students coming into the store, looking for what textbooks they need for their classes, purchasing supplies, trying to figure out if their financial aid will go through to pay off their merchandise. Its an ordeal at times!"
good,A wonderful environment to work in. Diverse staff and customers with one focus - education. Hardest part of the job was at the busy semester start/end periods with higher and faster paced work load. Working with people of similar age and drive is the most enjoyable. Management team very accommodating and flexible.
good,"Some seasons are very busy and hectic, but overall, a good place to work."
good,"I was in charge of the front counter. I would deal with incoming special book orders. I handled cash, counted and balanced all cash drawers. I also counted the safe, made deposits, and made money orders. I had a lot of experience in customer service through face to face interactions to over the phone."
good,Easy to get along with crew and management. Hardest part was calculating and putting together reports for membership sales.
good,"Like all retail you have problem customers, but for the time I worked there it was pretty easy. If you're a cashier as I was, they will expect you to sell a daily quota of Barnes & Noble memberships, so if you have a problem with that then you will be getting an earful pretty often."
good,"Barnes and Noble is a wonderful place to work. There are some drawbacks, such as very tight cliques."
good,"It's a bookstore so ordinarily I shelved books, loaded and unloaded trucks as well as cleaned up, but the whole work staff worked as a team versus not helping."
good,"Working at B&N is certainly challenging on a day to day basis. However, I feel as if I've hit a plateau with the company--where advancement doesn't seem possible any time soon."
good,"This was an extremely fun job! I learned how to work hard, to laugh and joke with perfect strangers.My coworkers were exciting and fun to be around. "
good,"Being efficient in all respects at work is vital. There are many different tasks that must be done quickly and accurately. Working as a team is important. If one or more co-workers called out you have to really be on your toes. Getting to know the customers and helping them is quite gratifying. Having been there for fifteen years I was in charge, at any given point, register work, magazines, and for over eleven of those years, receiving. Making sure to place product in the customers hands and putting items where they belong saves time and makes for a better business."
good,"I loved working with my manager in the cafe, upper management seemed rude towards supervisors and category managers but other then that I had a good experience."
good,"Working as a bookseller at Barnes and Noble was enjoyable. The management philosophy was sound and an environment of positive productive thinking was encouraged. However, job advancement is very difficult to achieve at Barnes and Noble."
good,"On a daily basis I was in charge of opening and closing the store.  Resolved customer and employee issues.  Kept SPH  in line.  Inventory control, hiring, scheduling , stocking shelves.  Days were kept busy never any down time."
good,"Overall I enjoy being employed here. A typical day for me would involve a lot customer service, managing my department leads and supervising the sales floor. My co-workers are a pleasure to work with, all of us bringing a lot of knowledge to the table. The hardest part of my job is expanding my knowledge. We are often so busy it's hard to learn about the different departments, but we manage! The most enjoyable part of the job for me is working with such a diverse group of people. There is never a dull moment here!"
good,I worked in the unviersity bookstore as a seasonal employee during the beginning and end of semesters when things got busy. It was a respectful and productive atmophere.
good,"I loved working for Barnes & Noble. The people I met, co-workers and customers, helped make me who I am today. Barnes & Noble is constantly trying to keep up with new products and improve existing ones."
good,I had a list of things to do everyday. I love that kind of work. I had a lot of fun because everyone i worked with was unique! I miss my regulars dearly :( The hardest part of the job was closing our doors!
good,"1) A typical day at work wouold be to check the bathrooms when i first punch in, then if there dirty closed the bathrooms down and the clean and sanitized them. after that would be to sweep up the store and clean the windows.. then check to see if the managers have any project that have to be done, if yes help work on the projects that require heavy lifting and moving, if they dont have and projects to be done then i would dust and polish the store book shelves.."
good,A pleasant and relaxing atmosphere where quality customer interaction is an integral part of a typical day on the job.
good,Handled customer transactions and placed orders. Guided students in finding correct books for classes as well as guiding them around campus. Worked with people of various age groups and interacted with various age groups.
good,I worked for B&N before e-readers became so prevalent. I am a traditional book person. I don't like e-readers and probably won't own one. I loved working with books all day. I really enjoyed my co-workers.
good,Barnes and Noble is a great environment to work in. You are kept very busy with tasks as a individual and a team. You have the opportunity to suggest books to customers to broaden their reading.
good,"I really, really enjoyed working as a bookseller at Barnes and Noble! I got the job just out of college to make ends meet while I took a gap year between undergrad and grad school. I had a great team to work with, and the store environment was very relaxing. I always had a project to work on while at work, so I felt accomplished at the end of the day. I only wish that we were paid more (surprise), and I wish you could work a full 40 hour week. I was originally given a maximum of around 35 hours. Other than that, I would definitely recommend working here, especially if you are a student or working towards other things."
good,"In my time at Barnes and Noble, between both the regular and College versions, I made a family. Working there was fun and I enjoyed going to work everyday. I learned a lot about customer service and working as a team at the Cafe. The hardest part of the job is a rush and not having enough people on staff but it can also be a lot of fun running around behind the counter."
good,"I only worked part time but it was always a fun time at work. I love books so being able to be around them and see what was new, always made my day. The discount it great too!"
good,"This was my first real job, I had nothing to worry about all my trainers were very nice, everyone did there work as they were instructed to do, The lunch room had some games to play."
good,The best people to work with in the best retail environment. You will not find a more dynamic management team in BCS retail. Management pays close attention to employees' needs and time constraints.
good,Usually quiet except for the occasional lunch rush. Flexible hours work great for college students and a friendly environment ensures a safe working environment for beginners.
good,"While working as a Bookseller involves a variety of inter-connected tasks, the overall experience at Barnes and Noble is relaxed and customer-focused."
good,I worked in a variety of departments and learned a lot from all of them. The break schedule -- especially during busy periods -- are effective and never missed.
good,I loved my job. The only reason I quit was because my school schedule was not being respected and created scheduling conflicts that I could not afford.
good,"Barnes & Noble is a steady-paced and relatively predictable work environment with a fun-loving, literate workforce that aims to be savvy to current cultural trends while maintaining the tradition of selling printed material."
good,"This was the first job I had and it was fantastic. The management was very helpful and wonderful with training, and wanted me to succeed. They like to keep promotions from within and I like that."
good,One of the best jobs I've ever had. Lots of room for growth.  Fun working environment. Relaxed yet fast paced and encouraging.  Management really cares about your family life and every employee becomes a member of your own family
good,"Barnes and Noble in Norman is an amazing place to work! The employees that work there are some of the nicest people that I've met. They are all very open to new people and loved training me. My experience there is one I will never forget. Also, the management is awesome!"
good,"I loved my job at Barnes and Noble, my particular store functioned like a well oiled machine and it showed in our sales metrics and customer loyalty. I had a great discount, life insurance and paid vacation, sick, and PTO days as a part timer, and when I was promoted I had that and full benefits and was making a living wage. I loved the customers and had plenty to talk to with them."
good,"I really enjoyed working here. I met all kinds of people, people came from all over to attend college at LSUA. I not only learned from them but i was able to teach some of what i've learned through the years."
good,"As a barista, I was able to pick up a book during my break and have a delicious and discounted hot meal. The rest of the staff is friendly and the management are all very nice people who make working there a pleasure. Hardest part of the job would be learning all the different drinks and dealing with customers."
good,"Although the experience at my store is almost certainly atypical due to a store manager more focused on practicality than corporate initiatives like force-feeding customers monologues on store credit cards, the environment was very relaxed and collaborative. Managers typically ask for help with projects rather than demand obedience. The focus on company priorities is certainly present, such as Membership conversion percentage, but is treated openly, with manager conversations focusing on tips to help rather than penalties for failure. Employees get along very well and share similar interests, making shifts feel more like hanging out with friends than grinding out a paycheck."
good,"On a particular day at work I will greet customers, take  and serve orders of food and drinks. It  really depends on the daily assignment our manager assign us. Some days I take food orders and serve the food, or im on the bar and i make and serve drinks like a barista. I will make the  , coffee, tea latte, cappuccino, for the customer  etc When there are no customers I will restock, clean , answers phone calls , and put away deliveries as needed."
good,"I work at a B&N College bookstore and my manager is the sweetest lady on Earth. I am constantly making connections with other students in the school and gaining experience. My manager is very understanding of my school schedule as well as my other job and the discount on school supplies is very useful, especially in art school."
good,"In someways all big box stores are the same...B&N was somewhat different. No stories about the company being designed on a ""Napkin""at dinner, etc. started as a REALLY great place to a good place. Thus is the way things change."
good,"I was working during the Christmas holiday season, so things were pretty quick-paced. However, everyone was incredibly helpful, offering constructive criticism and really making me feel like part of the team. If I could, I would've stayed on, and will reapply if the chance ever arises."
good,"Every day is different . Booksellers respond to sales trends and promotions. There is always a focus on selling the membership card. In my 21yrs I learned that you never really know anyone. Upper Management changes often. People come together over the love of books. People treat the bookstore like they are in their own home, and do not act as you would expect in any other retail environment. They come in and just sit for hour, using the free wifi, bringing in outside food, and using this relaxed atmosphere to conceal product and exit without paying. Meeting new people and sharing the love of books. Making a difference in the lives of fellow employees by teaching them skills that can help them throughout their lives."
good,High volume store always busy. How to work in management. Wonderful management team. Crazy and fun. Stressful at times. Unrealistic expectations. Staff!
good,I love my job and really enjoy working for the company. The perks are awesome and my coworkers are great! I enjoy getting to merchandize all the Barnes and Noble products because they're spectacular! And our events are so much fun!
good,"Books have become a thing of the past with modern and innovative technology.  Store has modernized by integrating other copies, brands and merchandise.  Nook is failing to compete with other devices such as the Kindle, iPad and Android.  Management is supportive.  Safe and fun working environment.  Unpredictable company future."
good,"As you can imagine, working for a bookstore can be very relaxing and quiet. Tasks were evenly dispersed and everyone had a great team spirit. The only downside is hours were very scarce in the spring time."
good,I was currently in college when I had this job so it was a very good job to have. You have slow days and fast. Angry customers and very kind customers. I made friends very quickly not just with my co-workers but with the management as well. I learned a lot of about how the angry customers are just having a bad day and smile.
good,I love working here. It is super relaxed and such a fun job. The people are amazing and it is so fun learning how to make all of the different kinds of drinks.
good,"Great team atmosphere. Working at Barnes & Noble / Nook Inc was a great time for me, particularly because of the amazing team I worked with. Out of many groups that made up the company, my group was the best (in my opinion). The chemistry was there and the management was awesome. We had some obstacles throughout our initial product launch and product expansion, but we always pulled together and released the best products we could. I learned a lot from my time at BN, there was definitely balance between work and life."
good,"A typical day starts at 8 am, depending on your position. There are a lot of positions you can learn, regardless what you were hired for. You won't just be dealing with the public, there are also events to plan and guide as well. It's a fun place to work."
good,"Managing a large bookstore can be a challenge, but having intelligent, more mature staff can make things so much easier. The stock itself often tempers the retail grind with intellectually stimulating aspects, and the realization that you are, in effect, contributing to the intellectual, spiritual and emotional well being of your clientele can be most rewarding."
good,"For a book lover B&N is a paradise to work in, intelligent co-workers, great material all around to sell, and wonderful customers always looking for a great new read. I started with the company in 2012 as a barista in my store's cafe area and worked my way up through 3 different promotions becoming ultimately a Merchandise Manager. My team is wonderfully supportive and the store is a gem; one of the best aspects of B&N is that what we are selling can't technically be called a necessity. Books, movies, even your daily coffee are all luxuries and working for this company will teach you suggestive selling, B&N needs to constantly impress their customers unlike a big-box mart which just needs to have your necessities. The training and opportunities presented to me by this job have really encouraged my growth and even after I leave the company (whenever that will be) I will continue to be a life-long customer as well."
good,"A typical day in my next job would be...."
good,"This was a temp seasonal position for me. Co-workers were great, management was great as well. I worked part-time but did like the job and atmosphere."
good,"Barnes and Noble is a great place to work. The people who work there are awesome, management isn't super overbearing with quotas or sales goals, and everyone's much more understanding of introverted tendencies than other workplaces. You also have the added bonus of being around books and maybe getting to work special events like author signings. It is still a retail job, so you do get stupid questions, rude customers, and things like that. But in general the overall clientele is a little more considerate than you might find at other retailers. "
good,"Fun, easy job. Wish it paid better. Good company culture. Perfect for students or retirees. Also good for people who like to read."
good,Working at Berklee College of Music Barnes & Noble is a terrfic experiemce for college student looking to work part time. Hours are flexible and convient for full time students and the environment is friendly and encouraging.
good,"Barnes and Noble has been a wonderful place to work. My fellow employees and managers are always helpful and pleasant. There is always something to work on, therefore, it is never dull."
good,You have the opportunity to deal with a very eclectic customer base on a daily basis. I would recommend this job to any individual who does not mind having a flexible schedule.
good,Great job culture with supportive Regional and Home Office Team. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop.
good,Very fun and enjoyable place to work.  Always busy and meeting new people.  It is a great place for advancements within. My co-workers were all great to work with.
good,"A typical day was very nice we work with mostly Howard University students, I usually sold apparel or worked as a cashier. The environment was very relaxed but also very productive due to the fact that most of the employees were students, This also helped in coworker relations. Management always pushed for the best most productive workers and helped on the floor when necessary. The hardest part of the job was probably the custodial duties and the most enjoyable was probably the work environment."
good,"Management and coworkers are all lovely and supportive. Happy to teach you skills and answer questions."
good,"in the 19+ years I've worked at Barnes and Noble, my job hours have shifted from 40 to 32 to 18 hours a week, as the company struggles to survive.  we've been thru 6 managers, two of them excellent, two fair, and two terrible.  most of my coworkers are friendly, intelligent, and possess good work ethics.  the hardest part of the job besides shrinking hours, is dealing with poor managers.  the most enjoyable part is doing work I love and dealing with books/movies/music which along with daily biking and running are the passions of my life."
good,"To be able to handle working in such a big store with many opportunities gives a good feeling of accomplishment. Sometimes things can be challenging but there's always someone there to help back you up or answer whatever questions you may have, even if it's just trying to bounce ideas back and forth on how a display should work. Co-workers are normally friendly and I've never had a problem with anyone, even made some new friends in the process of working here which is a plus. The trickiest part would have to be the management because there are quite a few managers employed to such a big store. Naturally they may have differing opinions, sometimes completely conflicting, which can complicate even the simplest of projects."
good,Many different areas of the store to learn and excell. Some areas a little more difficult than others but great co-workers to help along the way.
good,Selling books and working with a eccentric group of people. I learned much about customer service.
good,Great place to work for for the first couple years. Unfortunately the management changed and the environment became hostile and overly stressful.
good,co workers were amazing but the customers and rules not so much as you had to sell $6.00 worth of items to someone who just wanted a small cup of coffee and if you didn't go by their handy dandy sell pitch of 20 questions or more you weren't doing the job right.
good,"The management works well with all employees. The work schedule is very flexible.  A typical work day includes supervising cashiers, completing tasks, and making sure the store is presentable."
good,"Managing in a retail environment is very hectic. Not only was I managing my team, at times I had to manage the public. In this setting I was able to learn and explore many ways to problem solve and keep the employee and customer satisfied.  I thoroughly enjoyed meeting new people and authors."
good,"the management as worked with my full schedule"
good,"barnes and noble is a productive place to work and grow in a well kept organization. you will be taught many things and can request to learn things out side of your area of focus if you so choose. this gives room for advancement and position changes if needed. management is wonderful in the regards that they work with your personal schedule as much as possible, they are knowledgeable about their own jobs and therefore can help you with yours. they teach mentor and uplift."
good,"Barnes & Noble strives to create a community feel throughout its stores, for both the customers and the employee's. I truly did meet a wide variety of people throughout my time at the company. I enjoyed that aspect more than any other."
good,I was so happy to have been able to work on displays on the bookstore and learn how to create a display and learn how to create the flow of the store.  I enjoyed during this very much.  In addition to this I was responsible for checking in new items and even helping my manager help pick out the new items that we were going to order.
good,"A typical day at work would depend on where you would be signed. If you were assigned as a cash person, you'd go there. If you were assigned as customer served you'd go there. And so on and so forth. I learned so much at my work place including how wonderful the people are there, the challenges of working with the public, along with the knowledge of recent book titles and technology. The management, I found to be a little confusing at first but gradually learned how they wanted things to be done and they different styles within each of the managers. My main manager had quirks that I didn't (and currently still don't) understand within my background of interaction with people but, he was excellent at what he does. I enjoy my coworkers, but I find their style of coaching can be a little unnerving at times. They are great people, but mostly focused on the sale and not so much the quality of the product. I found the hardest part of the job was membership conversion goal. While, needed to keep the company alive, I found that much of the public realizes that books are fading out but don't have the money to purchase e-reader technology. The most enjoyable part of the job is connecting the right book to the right person. I have to say that the feeling of giving that person the joy of reading was just simply awesome."
good,Day always began with a touch base with co-managers which lead into staff meeting before opening to set the pace for days activities. For me in particular this would lead into preparing for incoming shipments and outgoing product.
good,I have never felt more at home with an employer then Barnes & Noble. They treat there employees like actual people and invest the time and training in you if you show aspirations and talent. I was blessed to have amazing DM's and Regional Managers. All levels of management were involved and truly cared about the business and the people that ran them.
good,the staff were very helpful and social and invitings. sine i worked text books it is quiet and getting busier everyday
good,"I've worked for Barnes & Noble two separate times and I absolutely loved working for the company both times. My second time working for them, I had a phenomenal management team and loved the staff in my store and my district. A typical day for anyone, including managers, centers around customer experience and project management. The hardest part of the job is probably the usual pitfalls of any sales/retail job i.e. tough sales goals, seasonal fluctuations, varied hours budgets throughout the year. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with a great team of diverse and interesting people."
good,"When I was working at Barnes and Noble I felt appreciated for my work. The management was very encouraging and understanding. Everyone on the team was positive and helpful. Plus I love books. ❤ The pay could have been a little better, but I enjoyed working here."
good,"I worked seasonal for this company. I was well organized, always 2 or more managers on the floor to assist with customers and employees. They worked hard to maintain a well run store"
good,"Working for Barnes and Nobles gave me the opportunity to progress with them. Being able to start from a seasonal employee to cafe assistant manager in under two years tells you that you can achieve higher goals within that company. No company is perfect, but with all its imperfections they all try their best to make sure its an enjoyable work experience."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Barnes & Noble.  Retail, in general, can be a difficult industry, but I truly believe that Barnes & Noble is as good as it gets."
good,"Very fast paced,don't be late numerous of times, friendly and helpful staff,favorite part about my day at work is the toy/games and puzzle section...."
good,"The employees & staff were really kind and fun, i had a great time working there. They all were very understanding and patient. great first experience."
good,"Much fun at work, A lot of team buildings, more incentives for agents. I was able to bring my family during their family day at work, which is I think fun and interactive."
good,A busy retail store with a good co-workers. The managers work well with employees.Good discounts. employees have the ability to learn all areas of the store.
good,"It was a nice place to work,the managers are kind and caring and they offer cross training  when a person is fully trained in their job assignments a great place for part-time work,"
good,I love the place I worked at and the people I worked with it was a beyond friendly environment and if I didn't have to move into the city which made commuting impossible i would've stayed.
good,"Everything was great at Barnes and noble, everyone was very friendly, I learned a lot about making drinks, and I developed people skills.  My only criticism is that i was directed to up-sell obnoxiously,  and I wasn't necessarily comfortable with that aspect.  Other then that it was a really great experience."
good,This job was perfect for a college kid that went to Santa Fe College at the time you work here for employment. If you don't go to that school then it may be a pain.
good,"4 years ago I started at BN for some quick cash for Christmas. It is now 4 years later and I still love working there. My managers allow me the time to speak to customer and use my expertise to give them the best experience I can. It is not about how many people I can help in an hour, but how I can mesh and understand a customer's needs. When I was ill my managers worked with me and cared about my health. Overall, I love working there and feel supported by management and coworkers."
good,"I worked in the cafe and mostly opened the store so the first thing I did was open the cafe every morning which included things like setting up tables, cleaning, start preparations for food and beverages. Typically you open by yourself and someone else will come in once the store opens; this puts a lot of responsibility on you but it's also nice because opening is an easy process if you're focused. My favorite part of this job was my team; I love everyone I worked with. Having a positive and encouraging work environment is so important!"
good,they have a great work environment with a spectacular management team to get everything accomplished. The only thing that i am not happy with is my rate of pay.
good,"This was a great place to get my first job! I worked in the cafe, which serves Starbucks products so it was a very demanding but fun job. People are very particular about their coffee, so this job makes you very meticulous, which is a great skill to have. I had the best manager named Lisa, who unfortunately got another job. I just wasn't too pleased with the salary, but I didn't complain because I was a very young with no experience so I ultimately understood."
good,Barnes and Noble has great supervisors and a good work environment. The employes are very nice and helpful too. It has a great working environment
good,This is the best job I've had from the environment to management. Going to work here is not stressful and is in a welcoming environment.
good,"Typically after school I would drive to work around 3:30 and I would clock in. I worked cash register made drinks, and did dishes alongside one co-worker, sometimes two. I typically closed the cafe on my shifts requiring me to check temperatures, throw out wastes, and restock the beverage case and food in the fridge and bake case.I learned many things with this job, including team work, patience and the ability to work quickly and effectively. My managers were some of my favorite people to work with. They made my work experience easier by having patience with me and teaching me right from wrong in a professional way. My best accomplishment from my job was the relationship I shared with my co-workers. I loved each person I worked with and I never acquired any issues with any of them and I still speak with them to this day. The hardest part of my job was when I was beginning my job and I had to close most nights, it was a challenge for me being by myself and having the responsibility of making sure the cafe was ready for the next day. I quickly adapted and became more efficient with my work and learned how to manage my time better. My job in general was always a pleasure. There isn't just one thing I liked best about it because I loved what I did and I loved everyone I worked with."
good,In a typical day things are not always the same. Depending on your position ( I've had the chance to learn 2 and am on the 3rd) things are completly different. On cash you always see new people and learn new things like an 1180 form and just how to operate. GM you ake sure the floor is well organized and keep items stocked and backstock and warehouse items. Overall there is a lot of standing your whole shift and if your not a people person this is not the job for you.
good,"The culture of Barnes and Noble College is very friendly. They are all about making sure everyone enjoys their jobs, and as a result, employees stay with the company for years."
good,I enjoyed working at Barnes & Noble. All my co-workers were very nice and helpful. I also enjoyed interacting with the customers and serving their needs
good,"job is fun, some annoying callers.  2 breaks 15 min- 30 min lunches.  Management mostly is nice.  Started from the bottom increased position internally over time"
good,I liked working in Barnes & Nobles but it was only seasonal no chance for a full time position.
good,"Working here was not bad at all, honestly. Aside from the consistent standing and walking around there was not much to complain about. the children were children and the adults did their jobs as best as they can"
good,"Fast-Paced. Excellent leadership and the team member around the store are great. It's busier than ever in the store, and changes from corporate have made working there very stressful. The pay is decent, but not great. Not for the amount of work that goes into the job."
good,The staff and Manages are all terrific. I love working with books and helping customers in any way I can. I am also very good at managing people. Fortunately and unfortunately upper management like CEO and VP of stores among others have changed frequently in the last few years. Many changes have come and the staff especially management may not agrees with new policies.
good,"A very busy place to work, but I worked with a great team, and had a wonderful managers, who were very supportive and excellent customer services, the best part is been very busy and fun place to work meeting new customer and the regular customers are the best and the hard part is sometimes not having enough employees to help  because we had college students they moved to another cities, so constantly we had to be training new people."
good,"Working here as a Cafe Server was my favorite job hands down. I loved being a barista, and everyone's attitude just fit perfectly. Communication is key in this position. The cafe manager goes way above and beyond than she ever needs to, but that's what makes her amazing. It's an easy, fast paced job. The only reason management has 4 stars is because of the actual store management. Not very respectful of the cafe, and more interested in the book floor."
good,"On any given day, I would be responsible for filling up the bakery case, running cash register, and making drinks. Along with those responsibilities, you were expected to know how to open and close, which we had a checklist for and you were trained to do. Great benefits for 20 hour employees, which is usually achievable within a year. You receive sick and vacation paid leave, and the option to enroll in 401k and life insurance. When you become full time, which usually occurs when you get promoted to lead, you gain other benefits. I'm currently a cafe trainer, trained to be a cafe lead when the position opens up, and it had taken me 2 years to progress this far. "
good,"13 years of employment with a company can be a long time. While I had other opportunities I genuinely love and enjoy my time with B&N so I stayed loyal and grew with them, first as a bookseller than as a manager."
good,Barnes & Noble College is a fast paced and well organized position that I would have loved to stay at had the hours been available. I felt very welcomed by everyone and understood basic directions very easily as training was well implemented. Management was open to questions if we needed to help customers and the overall environment was well managed.
good,This business is awesome to work for.. How many people can say they work in a bookstore?  You work with a wide variety of people and I get to travel.
good,I loved my coworkers and managers. The environment was so friendly and most like a family. Everybody cared about each other and we could all work together to achieve our daily goals. I thank them for the wonderful job experience and opportunities.
good,I was the bookstore temp for a month.  I help out the customer with getting their books and even shelving the books in the right categories with no problems.
good,"Answered customers' enquiries about books, helped customers choose books and stationery, priced stock, displayed stock and kept the store organized, kept account of stock, placed orders and returned unsold stock to suppliers via a computerized tracking system, supervised other booksellers."
good,Worked as supervisor at the college bookstore. Quickly learned closing/opening registers and cash balance. It was nice atmosphere and good student environment.
good,I loved working at Barnes and Noble. There was great team leadership and amazing coworkers. A typical day was always varied and there was always someone to support you.
good,Barnes and Nobles is a great place to work in. They take consideration of your school schedule. Customers are very friendly and it is fun helping them find books they are looking for. Great experience.
good,It was a fun first job while it lasted because it was temporary.
good,DO NOT make it a long term job! Working on the floor is a stepping stone not  a career. Most employees stay with their employment because it is easy to maintain and the responsibility is minimal.
good,"I loved working there and ordering and keeping the store organized and helping people find their books I also loved organizing the back room and keeping everything clean I loved my job, but unfortunately I needed to move."
good,Working for this company has been a pleasure to say the least. Never a dull moment throughout the day. Meet a variety of people throughout each day from all over the world.
good,"A typical day at work would consist of shelving books, assisting customers locate books and telling them how much their books are worth to sell them back. When trucks come it's important to take care of everything systematically."
good,I did not work for Barnes & Noble. I worked for Software Etc. inside of Barnes & Noble. Big difference! My typical day was to restock store shelves and provide customer support.
good,I liked this Job but it was not fun going in everyday. The management team was okay but it was some of them that did not do their job very well
good,In this job I was able to use my customer service skills helping college students in finding the right textbooks for upcoming classes that they were taking.
good,It was good I love working there with all my coworkers. I love getting to interact with people and made me realize I wanted to interact more with people and it helped develop my skills.
good,"Flexible hours, great personalities, not so bad as other retail jobs. Still awful during holidays, though. There's a definite block to moving up unless you've been there for many years. Small raises with good annual review."
good,"The store was great! I enjoyed the people that I worked with. We all got along and helped each other day easier. It is a very easy laid back job, absolutely awesome"
good,If you need yourself just a little part time gig then this would be nice for you while you are in school. Staff and coworkers were amazing and you have to love the feeling of being in a bookstore.
good,"the people there were nice. during closing it was fun because the atmosphere was lighter. i liked it there, and whished i wasnt only seasonal help. maybe ill apply again"
good,"Constantly need to sell memberships. Otherwise, great place to work. Management is friendly, the environment is bright and enjoyable. Learned how to be a better salesman."
good,Very nice environment but not much job security in the seasonal time. Not the worst retail job to have during the holidays.
good,I love meeting new people with this job. Management had great communication with employees.
good,"If you are looking for friends, this is a good place to work. everyone is friendly, and willing to show you the ropes."
good,"Really loved working there, I worked in the cafe as a barista, and had a very good time, loved all the new baristas, and loved everyone on the Barnes and Noble book floor. However, my hiring manager ended up leaving to further her career, and the new manager that got hired, and is currently working there, is a very poor manager, his expectations are very unreasonable for the employees, he doesn't listen to what the other employees have to say, and always does things his way, which in the end has resulted with very poor execution of things. In all honesty, he is the reason that I wanted to leave B&N, and many of my employees I stay in contact with since leaving, want to do the same, because he makes working for him unbearable. Besides having a terrible cafe manager, my overall experience with the Barnes and Noble company, and the employees that work there, are fantastic! Wonderful, exceptionally hard working individuals, and always are finding ways to help each, and every customer they come in contact with :)"
good,working in a bookstore was not anything I thought it would be. learning how to do the barcode system and checking out people when they were done shopping around. helping with displays and bring out new books and keeping track of what was in the store was all something I enjoyed learning in my time there.
good,"If you're a book lover, this is the best job ever! The hours suck, and the pay is worse, but when you get that rare customer who is so excited to find the book they're looking for, or the customer who wants to talk your ear off about their favorite book, everything else is worth it."
good,I would come to work sign in and either get behind the register or go in the back or help customers with any problems they may or may not have.
good,"It's great to work here if you're in school, and really fun in the cafe. There are obviously things that go wrong from time to time with the customers, but it's something that can be fixed and the community of employees and customers all around is amazing."
good,"It allows you to do a variety of projects for public relations, marketing, and sales. You are able to grow and they are very flexible with your work schedule. Sometimes you get very weird clients but management is always here to back you up if needed."
good,I've never been more in love with both working and shopping at a place more than Barnes and Noble.  My coworkers are fantastic and my supervisors are wonderful.  Truly a great team.
good,"This place is great for part-time workers or full-time workers. Working here helps with learning customer service skills, and it helps with learning how to act in unpredictable situations."
good,"I felt like the managers in this particular store made everything better, they went out of their way to make sure that things were taken care of, from sick time to vacations for part time employees"
good,"Working at Barnes and Noble has been an overall wonderful experience. The people who I worked with were kind and caring, the job felt like it was more about employee stability and happiness than it was anything else, and a supportive work community is important in order to maintain healthy customer relationships. The management wasn't the best at my store, there are a lot of people who are burnt out on the job and should probably try something different, it caused things to get messy more than once in a while. Other than that, I have created wonderful bonds that I will cherish forever and it is a wonderful place to have a job."
good,"I enjoyed working with my coworkers. They were personable, reliable, and easy to work with. I gained a lot of new friendships and it made my time with Barnes and Noble more enjoyable."
good,"High paced work environment, positive energy in the workplace. Great experience, would recommend to anyone looking for work with interest in books and novel industry."
good,"Managers in my B&N were all great to talk with, managed to get along with them and most coworkers. Most customers in a bookstore seem to act politely, so no major disturbances in your day to day."
good,I enjoyed working for barnes and noble. I really like reading and coffee so working in an environment where I was able to be around both was relaxing to me.
good,I loved working here. The pay was average. The people were awesome. The environment was friendly. Unfortunately had to relocate because of a personal reason.
good,good honest company with a lot of hard working and kind employees wouldn't regret having another go here but gotta keep moving up. its easy to get stuck in a spot here.
good,"The warehouse office team was very professional.  Many perks for all employees, including subsidized cafeteria, and gym. Demanding but fair. Tough to compete with so much competition, I hope they survive!"
good,"It is a very easy job. I would recommend to anyone that is currently a full-time student in college. The hours are not too much, the work is fairly easy, and all the managers are pretty easy to get along with."
good,Pleasant management and accommodating to my school schedule. Great job to start out as/continue growing customer service repertoire. Fun and clean environment.
good,A typical work day is very exciting because you go between working with customers at the register to Customer Service where you are interacting with customers looking for specific titles and shelving books that just came into inventory.  I loved the day being split so there is no boredom as you move each zone by the hour. The management is very laid back and will work with you in needing time off or working a second job even going to school.  The most enjoyable part of the job for me is working with the customers.
good,"With the right crew, this is one of the best jobs in the world. Helping people find books and music and movies that they love is a great way to make money."
good,"Barnes and Noble is a very enjoyable place to work. While it is very fast paced, it is still easy to make friends with the other employees and the regular customers."
good,"I was a bookseller at Barnes & Noble. My job was the help customers on the floor to find books they were looking for or to help recommend books based on other titles they enjoyed. I learned a lot about customer service at this job and with the help of a wonderful manager, I learned many aspects of the business that I wasn't aware of before. There was a very diverse group of associates that I worked with and we all seemed to enjoy our shifts together. The most enjoyable part of this job, aside from the people, was all of the books and authors I got a chance to learn about."
good,"I love being able to go into work every day and talk to customers about books--in many ways, it's the most rewarding job that I've ever held.  There's always new books and authors to discover, and sharing that experience with customers looking for a new book is always exhilarating."
good,"Helping customers to find books and music, Locate items not in store and place on order in not available within the local area. Learn how to work together as a team  Management is very helpful and willing to listen and advise. Workplace culture is varied. it makes it an interesting place to work.  Hardest part of the job--leaving at the end of the day.  Most enjoyable part of the job--the people you work with!"
good,"Barns and Noble is a great place to work part time. The pay is good and the hours are pretty decent as well. Although you don't really have a say in where you work in the store as a part timer, you do get a lot of experience with customer service and the layout of the store."
good,This job was on campus so it was very convenient. For the most part it was fun and laid back but some of the management styles were not conducive to the environment.
good,I worked here for five months at a smaller store.  Management was supportive and the company culture was positive.  I have nothing else to add to this review.
good,Engaging and collaborative work environment with systems and training in place to promote from within. Difficult at times to react quick enough to changing market. Most enjoyable product.
good,I enjoyed going to work in the 3 years I was employed here. The management was friendly. My coworkers were always easy to get along with. Got a lot of experience with customer service as well.
good,I really enjoyed working at Barnes and Noble college. The people there were great. I liked getting to know all of the students who came through.  I was sorry I had to leave.
good,"Overall, very relaxing work environment that caters to both employees and patrons. Would recommend this job to high school or college students as they go hand-in-hand."
good,"I enjoyed working at B&N it was very fast paced, always a task to accomplish, I was hired as a bookseller and within 2 months I was promoted to head cashier. I trained all new hires and was their back-up , I arthorized aborts, returns, cash pick-ups and anything else they needed help with. I would also cover MOD when they were on the lunches and breaks.I always backed-up our B&N Cafe.I believe in the best customer service  going that extra mile or just taking the time to listen to our customers."

good,The discount here is great if you love books. The staff is friendly. No benefits but overall a fun place to work and interact with customers. I would recommend this place for any one to work.
good,I loved every moment working at B&N until upper management took a turn for the worse. Left due to harassment from staff member after being forcibly relocated to another store
good,Productive and fun workplace with friendly coworkers and friendly customers. Provided a great opportunity to engage and assist customers in a fun environment.
good,Great fun environment where I got to assist college students and staff with their needs for their college courses. I really enjoyed the leadership roles that my supervisor expressed. Great job especially if you need flexibility while attending college.
good,Bookselling was a fun job i helped many different customers and met probably the coolest employees ever. Its one of the best jobs i have ever had!!!!!
good,A typical day at work was either busy or very slow. But the overall day was never tiring or stressful. It was my favorite job because it was very comfortable to be there and everyone was friendly and willing to teach. The management was great and very professional. I can't really think of anything that was hard about the job. The whole experience was enjoyable.
good,"I started the shift  by re-shelf ing a number of books, it was intriguing  because I learned of new books that were out. Customers were always happy when you found a book they were looking for"
good,"I had a great time organizing books and interacting with customers. Colorful employees, kinda stressed-out managers, Great leads on new reads. Good discount too"

good,Friendly employees. Peaceful and relaxing work environment. Management was incredibly friendly and helpful. They were always willing to give feedback and advice.
good,"I love Barnes and nobles , it was very calm and collective they pay was great and the costumer service was awesome if your into books that's a great job"
good,"My first job was working at Barnes and Noble, and I never hated going to work. My coworkers were awesome and I helping people with any book inquiries that they had."
good,A day at work while i was work here was that i had to make sure i listen to the chef with order and making sure i stay clean while i work. the hardest part about this job was making sure i know everything that happening in the book store.
good,"I do not work here. My novel, ""21 Guns Bid me Goodbye,"" is on sale through their online store. This information was simply grabbed from my online resume."
good,Large bookstore with a music department and cafe in most stores. Some locations are dedicated to college book sales. Customers can order online through the associate at the store.
good,Worked at a college book store between semesters and it was an enjoyable experience. Coworkers were friendly and management was bearable only issue would have to be when college students came in with their constant complaints
good,I really loved it there. The pay isn't the best but the people are great and the discount is always a plus. I only ever really got a lot of hours during christmas though.
good,"What you do every shift changes, and they take into account what your strengths and weaknesses are in each area that you can work at. Everyone is super nice, and it becomes a little family."
good,"-- Good place to work"
good,"If you are seeking a retail job that gives you experience in customer service, Barnes is a great company for that. Good people to work with. If you enjoy reading this is a great job for you. They may not give you a lot of hours. That being said, when I worked there, I was a student so they were very much willing to work around my schedule."
good,"Barnes & Noble was one of my favorite jobs I've had in my adult life. You meet many interesting people and get to help customers with all sorts of requests. You learn a lot along the way, as well as pick up some quality job skills that a lot of future jobs can appreciate."
good,"Barnes and Noble is a great environment to work in.  Peaceful atmosphere for the most part.  There are busy times, but for the most part, the pace is pretty relaxed."
good,"The environment of Barnes and Noble makes it a great place to not only work, but also spend leisure time.  The people who work for the store are knowledgable and do not have a ""push sales"" mentality, because of the nature of education being a vital part to the customers lives. A lot less stressful to work for a retail store that genuinely appreciates the products it sells"
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know each customer and essentially learning different genres of books. Each customer is different and adds to your knowledge. Not only are you helping them but they are helping you as well.
good,"The management at the Lakewood Barnes and Noble is encouraging, positive, and empathetic. It makes for a great work environment. The employees are fun to work with and everyone is supportive of each other."

good,Helping college students with everyday purchases from books to clothes and school spirit items. Good place to grow and transfer to other locations. There is always a mentor just a phone call away.
good,"Great place to work; people were friendly, the work was not too demanding yet not boring. Learning how to make the drinks was not difficult at all! Overall, great experience."
good,I loved working here.  The ability to see the new books arrive was amazing.  I loved having my own department in which I knew what the biggest selling titles were as well as knowing which books I needed to order.  The ability to know what book a customer wanted just by a brief synopsis really was a rewarding factor of my work day.
good,"I liked B&N. The push for memberships was the only part I hated. My job duties were:"
good,not a bad place to work for a part time job. it can get really stressful and way too fast paced and they refuse to staff properly. didnt mind it too much though.

good,It waas a pleasure working for a book selling company. I got to learn the value and worked my level best each and every day.

The internship has provided me with insight into how PR works at a corporate level and has helped me to perfect my writing, my editing, and my attention to detail."
good,"I cannot say enough good things about my time there. For retail, books are definitely the way to go. Its fast-paced work so you're never bored. Also, being a huge company, benefits for full time employees are great. The clientele can be challenging at times but is mostly smart, broad minded individuals. The same is true for co-workers. The hardest part would be difficult customers, but your managers will always support you."
good,"When I first started at Barnes & Noble I was a cashier. I was responsible for cleaning and organizing the front of the store and also helping customers locate, order and select multimedia in person and over the phone. I was also responsible for handling money and transactions with the point of sales system, inputting data, and calling customers about order and membership information."
good,"-stay busy "

good,"I learned a lot working at barnes and nobles. I did not expect to become adept at customer service, and using proxi machines for orders put out."
good,"Typically I would get to work and immediately jump into customer drink/food orders.  I would switch on and off the register if I had another co-worker with me, but if I was by myself I would handle everything alone.  When things would get slower I would catch up on doing the dishes, refilling the bake case, baking new batches of muffins/croissants ect. (if needed), cleaning the counters/espresso machine, refilling items ect.  I learned how to multitask very well and how to fill my down time with important work.  The management was very kind and helpful and my co-workers were a delight.  The hardest part of the job was probably having to constantly remind customers that we were not actually a Starbucks but a Barnes & Noble cafe that sold Starbucks coffee.  Many people would be irritated that they could not use their Starbucks rewards cards at our location.  The most enjoyable part of the job was not only my immediate manager who was fantastic but also my co-workers who were great and helped walk me through how to make each drink.  I also enjoyed the rush of customers on the weekends when I would get a line of hot drinks to make.  It was fun to work at a faster pace while making sure I was doing everything as perfectly as possible.  It was an enjoyable challenge."
good,"A typical day includes stocking/refilling the supplies needed, cleaning up the workplace, and serving customers in the midst of it all. I learned that you have to speed up your pace depending on the day and how many customers you have, you need to have a lot of patience when dealing with customers, and always remain level headed because the customers can tell when something is ""off"" with you. My co-workers and management team were good. We all got along and helped each other out when it was needed. I wouldn't say that there was any hard part to this job but the most enjoyable part would definitely be the smile on a customer's face after you hand them what they bought."
good,"It's a great places to work, I loved the environment even when it was busy, and I enjoyed working with the co-workers and customers."
good,"All managers are approachable and personable with everyone. Everyday I enjoy going into work. If I have a question or need help I know it will be there for me. The hardest part is the pay, but because they treat us so well it makes it all worth it. We have boards in the back room that have positive reinforcement and we're just like a small family."
good,"My bosses were demanding, but fair. I improved my knowledge of packaging and the supply chain. I bettered my organizational and motivational skills."
good,The people are awesome.  Making drinks is really fun (if you like that kind of stuff).  The customers are lovely.  The atmosphere is incredible.
good,at first there were so many types and variety of hot and cold drinks i was pretty over whelmed but the workers and managers were all to happy to help out. the costumers are grate as well as the workers i really cant say I dislike any of them there all so helpfully and willing to assist when help is needed
good,"I would handle and generate reports on a daily basis for managers and buyers. My responsibilities included updating a matrix of new buyers in an inventory management module system as well as granting access to said system to whomever requested it. By getting along with management and co-workers and gaining their trust, it allowed me to assist anyone who had difficulties in network or computer hardware issues."
good,I handled all online and telephone orders. Organized and stocked all inventory. Handled all promotional designs.
good,"Great place to work.  The staff is awesome and fun.  The location is awesome because it's in one of the best places in NYC especially now, during the holiday season.  The best part of the job is that you get to interact with all different kinds of people and for me, that's the most enjoyable and what I look forward to the most"
good,"I was there for a long time and enjoyed it very much, sad I left."
good,"Find out the specific area that you would be working for your shift that day. Of course fill in when needed throughout your shift. Attend to customers needs."
good,"Typical retail environment, with the exception with the fact that it was stationed within a college. The clientele was mostly students, but they were very polite and easy to get along with. Schedule was simple and manageable, and staff was excellent."
good,"pretty simple job. boxing book orders, checking isbn numbers to make sure the book is labled correctly. There weren't many worked in my position I was new and temporary. I experienced no hard times my few months on the job"
good,"love the management, makes you feel like family instead of employees."
good,"There couldn't be a better place to learn customer service principles. This company has always gone above and beyond with their service, and the treatment of their employees. This job gave me the opportunity to grow into a leadership position, and I couldn't be more grateful for that. It has given me an insight into my knack for sales and marketing. It can be quite hectic at some times, but it is well worth it, for it also teaches one patience, and how to handle situations of all kinds."

good,"Floor salesman for Barnes&Nobles RCC bookstore really just means you're trying to help people get the best deals for their class books. It puts you in touch with how the community is, somewhat gives you an understanding of how people are by talking to them face to face. It also helped that I used to be a student and that I could connect with the woes of buying books at pretty high prices, but I help them find plans that make it cheaper and that usually makes them happy and it's nice to hear a ""Thank you"" every now and again, it made the job fulfilling. Everyone at work seemed pretty upbeat and fully capable of anything that was thrown at them. If I had to say a bad thing about it, it was that it was seasonal work, which means it ended way too quickly."
good,"I had to answer phones, assist customers and make special orders all at once. I had to multi-task and work accurately and fast. I also had to make phone calls to customers and prepare orders for pick up and update orders and complete orders in the system. I also was a cashier and had to train new emplooyees"

good,"I loved knowing what new books were coming out.  Often we were given free advanced reader copies.  "

good,I help customers to a day to day bases. I love my managers and coworkers.
good,"Great management,fun co-workers. Best part of job is helping customers by recommending books to them."
good,I enjoy working at Barnes and Noble due to the flexibility I have in my schedule. I learned how to satisfy customers needs by making beverages and preparing food. The management and co-workers are great. The store overall is very team oriented. Overall it has been a great experience. What could improve is the pay rate as well as much needed full-time positions.
good,Barnes and Noble is a great place to any book over to work. There is just something incredible about working around so many books and you get to learn so many things.
good,fun and conenient because it was on campus and I was living on campus at the time
good,Receive incoming and outgoing calls through automated dialer system. Assist customers in regards to billing information. Reinstated customers in membership programs. Competed with other co-workers and other teams as a motivational technique. The hardest part of my job was not finishing a task for that day. The most enjoyable part of my job was leaving the customers satisfied.
good,"Pros: amazing coworkers, opportunities to learn and advance"
good,"Working for B & N is fun and rewarding, there is always something to do which makes the day go by very quickly. You get to interact with all sorts of people and get to know them a little by their book selections. If you enjoy customer service and reading this is a great company to work for."

good,I have enjoyed working for this company for the last seventeen years.  The majority of my coworkers have been very fascinating and wonderful people.
good,I have learned a lot and I have improved my customer service skills.
good,"...this is the place to work. The store I worked in was in an area that was pretty uniform as to the diversity of the population, but at work I found people who had different world views and who where generally very accepting. Bottom line is that it is a big box retail store, but it is definitely a very interesting place to work with often great co-workers."
good,Handled all cash and credit transactions and at the end of the day would close up. I learned to use a cash register as well as my first retail job. All the managers were great at that job. hardest part was keeping the line moving fast during the holidays. I really enjoyed everything I learned from there because it has helped me with future work in retail.
good,Barnes & Noble provides a fun atmosphere that makes room for all types of personalities. They provide competitive compensation and room for advancement.

good,check bags entering and exiting the store handle inventory shipments stock shelves and balance register 
good,"My co-workers and managers were very nice and easy to work with. Working with the customers and the products were the most enjoyable part for me. There was nothing hard about the job, because I loved it."
good,"The pay is poor but everything else is quite nice. The benefits are quite good despite the poor compensation. You never stop learning in B&N. However, you need to be strong physicallly. There is a lot of labor involved in store relays and daily maintenance."
good,This job was pretty easy. A typical day was helping someone finds books needed for class or school supplies. I loved working around people and interacting with others.
good,Barnes and Noble was an excellent company to work for. The team players were very educated and brought a lot of diverse talents to the teams. The management was great and stayed with the company for a long time.
good,"Working in the position of Community Relations has become contagious for me. I found that the link between our store and the Community is very important. Reading is one of the most important factors in life..we read signs, we read for school, we read important instructions, we read to escape or to learn or make ourselves better. My co-workers are like family to me, they are the best networking tool and help to build a better store. I love talking to the young readers or finding a book for a timid young reader."
good,"Loved the people, the environment, however the wages were low"
good,"I enjoyed each aspect of this part-time job, which I acquired when my husband had re-started his education and we needed more income to supplement my teaching salary in Lubbock."
good,Constantly learning new ways to interact with the customers. Always learning about new books and the latest Nook releases. Wonderful environment.
good,Fun work environment where everyday tasks are made exciting through fun managers and co-workers.
good,"Great manangers, great staff. Typical day depended on day of week, shift, and time of year. Overall rewarding and used variety of skills and knowledge to help customers and get tasks done. I learned so much from receving to being more outgoing. Hardest part was when I got a beligerent or rude customer. Most enjoyable was making a customers day for finding what they thought or others thought was unfindable."
good,I loved working for Barnes and Noble. The most appealing aspect of my job was the way in which the staff worked together in making each day a success. Managers are eager to bring out the best in each bookseller and they recognize when a job is well-done.
good,"Interact with great people (management, professors, students). Learn many skills, such as communication, patients, and being timely."
good,"i had to order supplies make espresso drinks, make employee schedules and got to deal with customers on a management level."
good,learned alot about coffee and the process it takes to make coffee
good,My co-workers really make the work day. It is nice to work in an environment where everyone has fun and respects each other. I have learned over the past six years that work should be enjoyable and Barnes & Noble has allowed me to experience just that.
good,I worked as a book seller and as their Community Relations Manager. The work environment is excellent!
good,"Each day at work was always rewarding with wonderful management and energetic co-workers. The hardest part of the job was having unhappy customers/students, but the most enjoyable part was happy customers/students."
good,I would help restock the shelves for the college students. I learned a lot about a college bookstore and got to meet a lot of my classmates who I did not have class with. I would do buy backs at the end of the semester to help students get money back for their books.
good,I enjoyed working here its fun and the bosses are nice if you enjoy working with people and don't mind being on your feet all day you will enjoy working here
good,"A typical day for me contained maintaining the children's area and putting all the books in order. I also shelved new books all around the sto,re. I never got bored. I also handled incoming book orders on the computer."
good,"Most of the management is pleasant, due to the economy it's not easy to achieve advancement in the company."
good,"I loved working for the Starbucks inside of this Barnes and Noble because I got to bake pastries, grill sandwiches for customers, and make coffee drinks."
good,"Barnes and Noble is a safe haven for customers to fill their minds with great books, music and stuff their faces withe Starbucks delicious food."
good,"Great place to work, little room for advamcent but atmosphere and managers make it worth it. Pay is capped at 9.50 per hour, so that's a bummer. Always have hours to work."
good,"I’ve been at Barnes and Noble for two years and it’s one of the best jobs I’ve ever had. The staff and environment are unbelievable. I have made life long friends and always feel respected by the managers. Unfortunately it is a corporation that is in the red zone of going out of business and even when I became lead in the cafe, the raise wasn’t anything to brag about. I’m also a full time student so it was difficult to balance the house plus my school time; let alone being about to pay my bills to survive."
good,"As my first job, it was easy for me to do; however, it felt like I couldn’t move up regardless of how many times I proved myself. Also, sometimes the sales goal was unrealistic which affected my hours as well. For the most part, I was paid to stand around because I got all of my work done early."
good,"I like this bookstore they have great books, cds, and polite customer service I recommend everyone to buy items here."
good,Nice place to work but employees should make at lease $9 an hour. Everyone works together with getting the job done and I have been train effectively on the correct way to deal with customers and also how to train new employees.
good,"It was a good experience to be there, it was one of my job experience in America, so i have learned a lot about the time management, commitment. I have met good people who were helpful to me."
good,I was hired on a part time basis when the store first opened. I would have liked to have been hired on a permanent  basis but management decided otherwise. I heard later on that the store closed shortly thereafter.
good,I had enjoyed my time working at this bookstore d ue to the fact that it had enlgightened me about the various forms of sales and marketing that'd be set to take place within work.
good,"Great for people who love books who a just getting into the work force. However, it  does not provide a livable wage for customer service/book sellers. Salaries need to increased. Great people work there! All are interesting and passionate and love the store. Doesn't feel like working in a chain."
good,"Relaxed, easy environment. As long as you did your job duties, you could read, hang out, and basically just maintain the cafe. Everyone is very friendly and helpful."
good,This is one of the best jobs I have ever had. The people that I work with are always friendly and we get along great. I feel as if I have developed my own little family while working there.
good,I thoroughly enjoyed this job with the company. My co-workers were great and interacting with people on a daily basis was very rewarding. The atmosphere was relaxing and fun.
good,"I learned a lot from working here including customer service skills. I also learned great organizational skills from stocking shelves as well as bringing customers to the books. The hardest part was learning the layout of the store, but I was able to learn it rather quick"
good,"Great team environment, coworkers made the retail environment worth wile and enjoyable. For most employees, it is a stepping stone while they are in school until they graduate. So there is always a new batch of young employees to teach."
good,"Working at B&N during the summer and the begging of college classes is interesting. At the begging there is not much to do for you must learn how the system works, the registers, the location for books, and how to take orders."
good,Great place to work if you are looking to work part time and want to get paid weekly. I worked there as a cashier and the job is pretty simple. My co workers were nice.
good,"In the line of customer service there are always opportunities to help consumers by providing necessary information before purchases. My job at Barnes and Noble allowed me to speak with customers, understand their needs after brief discussions, and escort them to the correct means in which to secure their final purchases. I've had many return customers who became comfortable with their bookseller of choice. Helping people can be quite rewarding."
good,"Mostly it depends which branch you're at, but there is a lot of management problems with sales goals being unreasonable and a lot of stress. I loved being around the books, but less interested in the culture."
good,"my co.workers are very outgoing,thy helped me when i needed help but management was horribe didn't get enough work hours they pay of rate was horrible especially for all the work they make you do"
good,"Nice people. Engaging job with a lot to learn. Customers are usually nice."
good,"Buyer was a misnomer at Barnes & Noble where the magazine department was concerned. That position required extensive personal contact with both large and small magazine publishers, distribution executives, and store operations and was more of a negotiators role. In this capacity I increased inventory turn by more than 25 percent and margin by 20 percent. Ultimately left because of no bonus compensation for increasing promotional revenue."
good,great work environment. staff is friendly and knowledgable. customers who frequently shop become apart of the B&N family.
good,Everyday on the job was like a big classroom. I enjoyed socializing with other peers and helping students locate products.
good,"The Job was absolutely amazing! its great work for those who just need to get on their feet, want to make some money on the side, and who definitely want a friendly and wonderful working environment. it was the best job I've ever had and they really prove to you that their is a place that doesn't have to be awful to be at."
good,"Hoaurs - 7:00am - 11L30ma"
good,"I loved working here, but due to outside life I couldn't keep this job.  It is a demanding job but fulfilling.  The hardest part is closing, because you tend to do it on your own and it can be strenuous and tiring for a single person."
good,At Barnes you are surrounded by highly intelligent and motivated individuals with a passion for books. Co-workers were a delight and management was flexible and fair.
good,Position is pretty relaxed a great position if just starting out to work but if wanting to make a living on the job...can't happen
good,"A typical day at work would consist of making sure the floor was presentable to the buyers, clean and professionals. Alot of communication with buyers looking for books, questions about course requirements, even about campus itself. "
good,It was a cool job too bad they closed our store. i really miss those guys
good,This is a good place to work with nice knowledgeable coworkers.
good,"I enjoyed working there (of course, I’m an avid reader).  B & N stays relevant even in the digital age.  There’s something for everyone.  If they don’t have it, they’ll find it."
good,Out of all my jobs this is my favorite! I love how everyone have respect for each other despite the differences all the managers are kind and willing to help you. Only down fall is that sometimes we do not get enough hours and if you are not a manager it is impossible to make a living with this job alone.
good,"It is a good job if you want something temporary and have retail experience. The manager is a nice person. The hours are flexible. All of the staff are helpful. It is a fun environment. However, ig is a job, and employees are expected to act in a professional manner."
good,I enjoyed a lot to work there and meet very nice people and learn many things is a very good place to work because you can look at the books when no one is buying them
good,Fun place to work if you love books.  Much of job happiness depends on the management team.  I was lucky in that I had a wonderful store manager who enjoyed working there.  Pay is not great but employee discount is wonderful.
good,"I learned a lot about working with people and management.  Good work place culture, always received help and was able to provide help to other workers. It was a fun job!"
good,Loved the management and co workers. Very friendly. Very easy. Very satisfying. Would love to work here again. To bad it was temporary. Loved loved loved this job
good,"It can be a lot of fun.  You won't get full time unless a management position becomes available.  What is really great about this job is that they have to accommodate your schedule so if you need to work another job, you can adjust your schedule to fit those needs."
good,"Do you have a passion for books and love working along people that feel like a family? I you would love working for Barnes. The pay is nothing, but if that is not a concern and you want to feed your book habit with a worthwhile employee discount... While selling books to people... It is perfect for you."
good,"Relaxed atmosphere and plenty of tasks but not overwhelming. Really great customers and events. Pay is minimum wage, but that’s expected in retail. Really slow for advances but the work is fun."
good,"Work culture is great, I've learned the importance of time management. Teamwork is important to help the company. The most enjoyable part is getting to know new people and socialize."
good,"I like working for Barnes and Noble. The company used to be better. Now, with the exception of management, they do not hire full-time employees. They also do not offer benefits to part-time employees."
good,"You couldn't ask for a more enthusiastic and devoted group. This was a seasonal position, so we temps had to dive in and get up to speed in a hurry. And when the inevitable  errors  occurred at the register a manager would calmly get us back on track with never a  discouraging word. The holiday season was busy, intense and tiring, but  exhilarating. And the customers were generally appreciative, and often ecstatic, when we tracked down an elusive title. Was sad for the position to end."
good,"great job for students or part time work "
good,"The managers are great, the people are great, and most of the customers were great. I enjoyed this job to the point where I've considered staying on the schedule once a week just for fun."
good,"If you love to read and are just looking for a temporary holiday job with decent discounts on lattes, this would be the job for you. "
good,Most employees were interested in reading and as such we had a healthy work environment where discussion of books was encouraged.  The later time spent working there was more stressful though as the managers would put more pressure on the employees to serve the customers better.
good,"I have always enjoyed my time at Barnes. I have worked in 3 different locations (with one location standing out as being the best workplace I have ever been in) and they have all been enjoyable. I highly recommend booklovers to pursue a part-time career at Barnes, however, as a book lover myself, it can be hard to stay away from all the books."
good,"Loved working here, but there was no career advancement. Definitely would reccomend to high school and college students; however, I would not reccomend searching for a career if you start out as a bookseller."
good,I worked at 3 different locations in the central Columbus oh area. I loved my co-workers. I still consider them close friends. Management was poor at 2/3 of the locations I worked at. You can’t change what corporate wants or allows but the family there makes it worth it for sure. Would definitely go back and would recommend to anyone with a love of books.
good,"A typical day at work involves ringing out customers, making sure the sales floor is clean, helping customers if they need it, processing and shipping online orders, receiving UPS shipments of books and checking them in, stocking the floor with books and clothes, opening and closing the store, and balancing the cash drawers."
good,"Working at Barnes & Noble was the best job of my life. I miss it so much that I nearly cry every time I go back in to shop. The only reason why I left is that the pay is so low, you just can't survive on it. The few full time positions available were paid at the same rate of the part time ones."
good,"I truly love Barnes and Noble, not only because I'm an avid reader, but because its a relaxed and friendly environment. I highly recommend applying to Barnes and Noble if you're looking for a productive yet friendly work place."
good,working with college students helping them find text books for their classes. pretty laid back and chill job for a college student. hardest part of the job was not being a steady full time
good,"Very Sales driven environment. Love working with Schools and businesses.  Very nice work culture, results driven.  Lot of part time employment.  Good management team"
good,"I adored working at Barnes and Noble.  The management is very good and the employees are interesting and hard working.  The pay is poor, so you have to love this job to do it."
good,"The managers are flexible with your availability and the staff is overall very friendly and cooperative. the customers are wonderful, you have the occasional grumpy ones, but it's still a very happy store."
good,"receive and stock incoming merchandise, cashier, customer service, zone books shelf areas, do go backs, morning meetings every day with booksellers,  keep all employees updated to all upcoming promotions"
good,"A typical day at work involved greeting customers and helping them find what they need,answering phone calls,organization of the store and assisting at the register.I learnt great customer service skills and talking to customers helped boost my confidence when speaking to strangers.I can not really say there was any hard part of the job,the best part was the employee discounts on textbooks and stationery."
good,"A great place to work, if you know how to deal with angry customers then it will be a easy job for you. Just be able to understand the system of online ordering. I would recommend this job to anyone."
good,"My favorite part of working for Barnes and Noble was that I could take any hard cover book home for up to two weeks. I can read anything in two weeks, so I got to get a lot of extracurricular reading in!"
good,"I loved the freedom to read any book on the shelves and the program for borrowing books."
good,"The staff is really friendly and warm welcoming, the reason I did not give it great reviews is because I was only there as a seasonal temp. I love the job I had there I was in the deli/ coffee area. I loved being a barista I've been a barista for about 5 years with family owned coffee shops and even starbucks."
good,"It is fast paced, but totally rewarding. I loved being able to order the supplies, convenience, drinks, and textbooks! The customers are friendly and very patient."
good,I absolutely loved working at Barns and Noble and I wish my temporary position would have lasted longer. I loved working with others who were not only my coworkers but my peers as well. This bookstore sits right on campus and is so convenient for everyone on campus.
good,"Typical day includes arriving early to stock shelves, followed by standing at the register and waiting for people to purchase items. I was seasonal, and it was always busy. However, I enjoyed the team and everyone at Barnes and Noble. The management was terrific. I plan to be back for this Christmas season. "
good,This small café in one of the smaller Barnes and Noble bookstores was a treasure to work in.  As a manager who worked predominantly alone I was able to really turn the locations previously plummeting sales around.  I felt 100 % responsible for the cafes ability to meet its monthly Profit and Loss goals and was very proud of my little corner of the store. Sadly smaller locations were rapidly closing their doors and mine ended up being one of them.
good,"A standard shift requires attention to detail, phenomenal customer service and support, and ability to actively think on the spot. Learn to properly handle tills, prepare food based on regulatory details, and serve customers to the fullest potential. Staff is friendly, pursuant, determined, and willing to extend great service. Management provides excellent quality work ethic. Teaches how to efficiently perform the tasks at hand, as well as maintain a punctual and time-manageable environment for everyone involved. Most enjoyable part of the job is learning something new about franchised corporations everyday, as well as meeting new people."
good,I got to learn how make starbucks drinks and got to meet new and great people. I didn't got that much customer complaints then I did as a manager at mcdonalds and everyone is very educated and understanding. I loved the atmosphere and everyone was very helpful and courteous
good,"Absolutely love working here. It's part time and minimum wage, but it has been by far the best part time job I've ever had."
good,"I love working here, I just don't get very many hours, and so I am looking for a second job or a differetn job with more hours all together."
good,"I've learned alot working at barnes & noble, it is a very fun job to work at"
good,It was fun to be there as a volunteer and it was not hard work just alot of standing up.
good,"Best retail job there is, I enjoyed my time here and the culture of the customers.  Staff felt more like a family then coworkers!"
good,"a typical day starts by assisting customers and ends with keeping those customers happy"
good,I learned about the codes that they use to determine which book goes where. It was a good experience.
good,"My typical day is Clock into work and hop on cash register. I learned all the basics on how to manage the store. Including ho to handle stocking the store and using the register. My co workers are great. Not just on a work schedule, but as well as other situations as well. The hardest part of my job is making sure the store functions accordingly; including keeping the store stocked and in order. Enjoyable part of my job is making sure the customers are satisfied."
good,"Interacted with a large variety of people on a regular basis.  I love talking to many different people from different walks of life. I literally learned something new every day just from the customers.  That was the most enjoyable part of the job.  The management staff, lead by Christy Casey, is amazing.  They are always willing to work with each and every employee to cover their needs and help whenever necessary.  One thing our company always encourages is to use your fellow coworkers as a source of knowledge.  If you do not know the answer, ask a coworker.  This always led to open, friendly cooperation between all coworkers.  The hardest part of the job is angry customers that refuse to let you fix the problem or even listen to reason.  Thankfully, they were few and far between. "
good,"Good work environment and great management. "
good,"A wonderful experience to connect to the community and meet authors, local leaders, organize charity drives."
good,"This was a great time meeting people, working at a fast pace and encouraging co-workers."
good,"I have gotten to know 90% of all employees at this location and they are all extremely lively, helpful, and friendly. Easy to love. Management is super down to earth and understanding."
good,I loved working at this company but upper management dose not have your best interest at heart. If the company is in down fall. They will get rid of the best workers that they have and hire two to three employees in place of them . no experience needed.
good,Working at Barnes & Noble is a dream for the literate persons. What joy it brings to watch like minded people discover new worlds in ink lined pages. I would recommend it to anyone who loves books as much as I.
good,"This store runs like a family. Of course, all families have a few problems, but overall, everyone is helpful, kind, and willing to work. I have been very lucky to be a part of this team."
good,"I loved working there. Im a booknerd at heart and helping people find and discover new books was a joy. I was sad to have to leave for, what I thought, was a better job oppurtunity, as Barnes wasn't making the bills."
good,It was so much fun working with all the different people and i love books which made it so much more fun and relaxing when i went to work. I was happy working there.
good,"Worked as a temporary bookseller. My store's lease was ending and didn't renew it. Otherwise, the experience was great. Management was easy to talk to. The vibe is usually relaxed and pretty slow. There isn't anything that goes too crazy there."
good,I worked part time at Barnes and Noble while in school. The atmosphere was better than many other retail jobs and I was able to have the freedom to do my job and tasks at my own pace.
good,"The coworkers make all the difference, everyone is nice and easy to talk to. The store manager is wonderful. The job is easy once you understand what you're doing."
good,good work environment. most of the managers are cool. the only issue is that there transferring process is terrible. your better off just applying to other locations on your own. its the best experience I've had working retail. nuff said.
good,They are very flexible with your hours. especially if you go to school most of the time. They give you resources to pass your classes and they encourage you to take time off to focus on finals and midterms as well. Great job if you are a fulltime sudent
good,Loved working for this company. Retail has hit hard times but hopefully they will adapt to the changing environment and remain in business for the future
good,Had a chance to learn more technical skills. Worked in both desktop and mobile applications. work from home option. had a very challenging task during the release.
good,Great opportunity to build relationships with both staff and customers. Developed strong customer service skills and ability to adapt to fast-paced work environment.
good,"I really loved working at Barnes and Noble. The team was wonderful, and very willing to feed my need to learn something new each day. I was hired to work the customer service desk, and by the end of my time as a seasonal employee I had also learned several other duties in store (inventory counts, cashier, returns, stocking, etc)."
good,While working at Barnes & Noble I have been able to further my knowledge by becoming acquainted with diverse subjects in order to recommend a wide variety of books to our customers. I have been able to further my sales experience by meeting the daily goals of membership conversion and email sign ups. I look forward to going into work.
good,"I loved absolutely everyone I worked with ar B&N, the management was friendly as well as the coworkers and they were always very understanding. Its not a place that will pay for rent but it is a nice part-time job"
good,"Barnes & Noble was a good fast-paced environment to work at. You'll learn coordination, organization, and management skills. I felt well appreciated as well as welcomed!"
good,A typical day at Barnes and Noble Factory was picking and packing Barnes and noble orders as we stand and scan the box and walk to locate the orders in the aisle and pack them.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Barnes and Noble, because it's a top notch company. I took pride in my daily tasks, and learned a lot about retail and data entry in this position."
good,"Good place to work, Typical retail, with books. If you understand retail culture- namely, the priority of income over, say, customer comfort, then this is a good place. They treat employees VERY well, and if you're a bibliophile, I highly recommend. However, if sales culture and social interactions are not your cup of tea, then I suggest finding something else."
good,"At B&N you have one the job training, cross training in all departments, and learn a lot about your community. It can get very crazy during peak hours and seasonal times. Working in the children's department you are able to enjoy the kids love of reading Bloom. "
good,"My position at Barnes and Nobles was a calm and simple job helping customers find, order, or return their books. The atmosphere is very relaxing and never stressful."
good,"Barnes & Noble provides a healthy, relaxed work environment. Retail positions within this company will exercise your spatial memory. The culture here is one of positivity and reinforcement of positive behaviors."
good,"BN is keeping afloat; yet, investors are not looking to add risk due to market shrinkage nationwide... BN seems to internally have problems spending revenue on the basics --- a/c systems, lighting, signs/nametags, office supplies....  And, their pay scale is low compared to other ""zero skill"" jobs....  Problem is, the public keeps a perception somehow a BN employee is ""smarter"" than a burger flipper, and thus the public requires more attention and answers."
good,"On any typical day, you basically do customer service and help customers find books or recommend books depending on what they are looking for. You build relationships with the customers and all the managers work hard to ensure that we provide world-class customer service."
good,"Decent management who will try to work with you as much as possible. They are very flexible with hours and helpful when it comes to working schedule around my school schedule. They have a bit of an issue with amount of hours given, sometimes giving too many when they aren't wanted and not giving enough when they are wanted, but otherwise a great place to work with friendly and helpful co workers and managers."
good,"I currently work at BN and I love it, but I'm looking for a second job as hours are pretty limited. Barnes & Noble is a really great company to work for, and you learn a lot about selling and serving customers."
good,I could have worked at Barnes and Noble forever if it had paid better.  I had so much fun working there and love the managers at my store.  I received great retail experience and looked forward to going to work everyday.
good,"I loved working at Barnes and Noble. It was the perfect part-time job in college. The managers were understanding, the staff always helpful, and it was a great retail experience that has taught me many valuable life lessons."
good,"Lovely, productive, and clean place to work.  Very large selection with a good sized section of sales. I enjoyed my time working there."
good,"They are an awesome company, but I have never felt I get paid enough for all that I do. They have some kinks they need to work out with communication between the people actually working in the stores and the people in the corporate offices."
good,"Best group of people to work for. Outstanding managers and fellow / sister booksellers. Retail is retail and you have to take the sublime with the sludge, but I couldn't have wished for a better group of folks to spend the past 9 years with!"
good,"It was very laid back and management is OK. "
good,"Great Company to Work for."
good,"It was a retail job, but a lot of fun. I like to read, so the 20 percent discount was a treat."
good,This was a great first job with great people. This job is a very good job for learning all about customer service. The coworkers and the customers were great people.
good,"Based on what I can say, Barnes and nobles is an excellent company which provides for a great working environment.  Management was excellent and very supportive and willing to train newly hired staff like myself."
good,"The store that I worked at I would definitely say that I work for again, mainly in part due to the co-workers and management that was there. In regards to management they would pitch in where needed and made sure that we were as a team should be and were there any problems they were quick to find out what was going on and how to fix it. They also made sure that we were safe, anything that they considered dangerous for us they would immediately dispose of. Co-workers also played a huge part in enjoying my job, again we all worked as a team and we all got along with each other, if there was conflict we were able to work together and figure out what needed to be fixed and how to overcome the problem to avoid any future problems or repeats of the same problem. The hardest part of the job would have to be trying to please all of the customers, there will be times when there are customers who just are not easy to please and I learned how to deal with them without getting frustrated or angry."
good,A typical day starts with shelving and putting in place the sections of books to accurate locations. A short staff meeting with mandatory sharing of any item you choose from the store for constant learning from each other of new products. Then the doors open and all day is variety of customers who will all need help locating titles and items. Helping customers locate books in foreign languages or comic books. Being available at almost all times for recommendations of other items and similar items. Reading a lot for children at story time. The people were great the hardest part was scheduling and the best was helping each person find something that interested them.
good,"From opening to closing the Barnes and Noble always had a warm and welcoming feeling. Fresh books planted across the floor with the cafe baking and brewing for thier early bird customers. If anything I've taken away from this experince is how to maintain an organized,clean, and fast working enviornment while leading a team of employees to establish relationships with the customer base. I enjoied almost everything of the job, working, cleaning, communicating with customers, hosting events, and even covering shifts for call outs. The biggest problem was the managmnet staff. They failed to hire qulified canidates for the job thus creating a trickle down effect of never ending call outs, no call-no shows,and even shrink."
good,Everyday I learned something new and met with a lot of unsual customers all the time. And the people I worked with were very helpful and patient.
good,"New management is there now making it a much better place"
good,"Provide world-class customer service through our 4 core principles."
good,I worked at the bookstore while attending CSU.  It was cool  I was able to meet a lot of people.  Not my career choice.
good,Good people helping others with their love of reading and research.
good,"A typical day at work was a set schedule and making sure customers have everything they need and their questions are answered. being a cashier, I make sure they have everything they need and that their visit was a good one."
good,"Typical day at work will be ensuring the students have their questions answered. Also, it is important that I think like how a student/customer would want to be treated: with respect. Hardest part of the job is the standing for long period. My co-workers are awesome and did not have any problems with them. Most enjoyable part of this job is that I encounter different types of personalities and use this to adapt and be a better worker."
good,I would get there early that morning. Work some and then go to class later and then come back and finish the day up. I helped with stocking the shelves up for the upcoming semester. Help them with sending out books to be shipped out and with students getting their books for class. Unfortunately it was only a temporary job. The manager at the time was nice and even got to eat out one time with all the employees before it got busy. She was one of the nicest managers I ever had.
good,"I learned valuable customer service knowledge from working at Barnes and Noble. The other employees are fantastic, so you get along with everyone. The most enjoyable part of this job is the feeling of accomplishment when you find that one book/cd/dvd a customer has been searching for. You're always doing something. Whether, it's helping a customer or putting up a new display."
good,"planning events, selling books, customer relations, foocused and improved my skills in training and development of employees, love the customer interaction"
good,"As a barista you work like any other barista from Starbucks. Learned how to make all kinds of drinks, prepare food, enforce food safety, act professionally. Management has been very good overall. My coworkers are the most fun, diverse people you will ever meet. The hardest part of the job is dealing with customers that are particularly difficult. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing I'll always have a job at Barnes and Noble "
good,"Bookselling is a noble profession, exemplified by the culture at Barnes and Noble."
good,"One of the most exciting, rewarding, and challenging companies to work for. As a Bookseller and part of the Nook sales team, I have gained an insight into the local Book-buying community both young and elderly, as well as researching the advantages/disadvantages between Trade paper books and E-book formats. Bringing my extensive experience in customer service to this company has brought profitable revenue into the store, including long term advantages to both customer relations, service/sales and has increased daily connections with loyal repeat customers."
good,Helped students get their textbooks for the school semester help staff order the books they need the students to buy for class
good,"For customers, Barnes and Noble is a fun and relaxing place. In fact, customers tell us how much they love our stores on a daily basis."
good,"A typical work day is coming in the job and start to work immediately. the staff and management were awesome. The hardest part would have to be waiting on the check, otherwise I have no complaints."
good,"Management great. Co-workers great, at least the regulars. Loved it but couldn't live off the money."
good,"my typical day at work is when customers come in to oder drinks and or our delicious deserts. what i learn at work is even when customers can be difficult just ignore that and just make them happy in anyway possible. my managers are always there when you need them, also are there when you need someone to talk to fas as help in the cafe and general questions. my co-workers are very enjoyable to work with they keep excitement in the cafe. ui will say their isn't anything hard about working in the cafe. the most enjoyable part about working in the cafe is when i make the customers happy"
good,"Barnes and Noble is one of the best places I've ever worked. The store manager along with the assistant manager and textbook manager were all very understanding, lenient at times, as well as firm, when needed. They treated all of their employees as family and that's what I consider them to be, to this day. They were always fair with hours; they were able to work around schedules so that we were able to get hours in as well as time studying or with our families. They would also decide how much work one would be responsible for, to show their strengths and weaknesses (I was trained in several areas so they could always rely on me to get things done efficiently). I loved working there."
good,Barnes & Noble is a company that has very good benefits for their booksellers. growth and opportunities for their employees.
good,It’s a easy job it’s just a lot of cleaning but the people there are so fun to work with and they are really caring and understanding. The people who work there make it fun. It’s honestly a great job and a great company it just wasn’t for me
good,I was so sad I had to leave when I did. My coworkers were amazing! And our managers were great at working with us and our schedules. This is definitely a good place to work
good,"It’s a dream job. Being surrounded by books and likeminded individuals is one of the perks. The hours can be long and the work is hands on, but it is rewarding ultimately when you connect with customers and even helping someone fall in love with reading."
good,If you love books it’s a great place to work. The employee discount is really nice. At my location most booksellers get 20-30 hrs a week as long as they have the availability. For the most part my management team is great and is pretty relaxed if you are sick and need to call out.
good,I learned that it was always nice to see customer leave happy with a drink I was able to accommodate for them. The work place culture was very friendly and amazing staffs. The enjoyable part of the job is making drinks for customers.
good,"Barnes and Nobel is a great place to work if you love books, of any kind. It is a much nicer work environment than other retail jobs, with customers generally nice. At both stores I worked at the management were very enthusiastic and kind. They provide incentives and small competitions between the employees to make it a fun and interesting place to work."
good,Loved the job. I would have never left if the pay was better and there were benefits. Everyone is part time. There is only 4 full time positions in the whole store. Great work environment.
good,I really loved working there. The managers knew their stuff and did everything they could to help you succeed. I met wonderful customers and the employee discount was my favorite thing.
good,"Worked here for 8 years before having to move. Management was always understanding of family issues and working around your availability. The pay was mediocre, but the staff was like having all your best friends in one place and the work was often fast paced, so time went quickly. Working cafe was the worst of it, bc of the extra twisting, bending and angry customers who needed their coffee just so you could go home smelling of stale espresso. Always was fun to see what other people were interested in and helping them find what they needed. I was very sad to leave, but I moved acrossed the country."
good,"Loved my coworkers, loved the environment, loved my job. Shame I couldn't stay longer. Even as a full time employee I wasn't able to support myself. There is an excellent work life balance though. You need time off and they were very flexible."
good,Really enjoyed the atmosphere there and never had problems with management. It is retail so the fast paced service that was sometimes needed could get stressful.
good,"As a college student/ book lover, this is a perfect job if you're looking for a small part-time job. You work 4.5-8 hour shifts at any time of the day. On Monday I could open the store, but on Tuesday I could be closing. They could also have you working cash-register one day then customer service the next. Management at the Nashua, NH store is fun, but they pressure you into getting people to sign up for the B&N Membership. As long as you are trying to get people to subscribe, then you will be fine. I love going back home to work here, but the pay is low. I could not live off of what I make here, but it's good spending money."
good,"I enjoy my job, but the pay is not commensurate with my skills/responsibilities.  The company has endured some tough years, questionable decisions by upper management, that render its future uncertain."
good,I worked very part time my first semester of college.  It was a minimum wage job with lots of stress.  It would have probably been better if  I were able to work more than 10 hours a week.
good,"Barnes and Noble was amazing, From being cafe lead to receiving or cashier to customer service I always had a great time. The pay wasn't to good but they worked around your schedule."
good,Fun place to work .People are so friendly to work with activities .Holidays people come in more during Christmas ready to pay money for great gifts.very busy time of the year.
good,"it was a good company to work for, if you lile books and people it doesnt even feel like a job, but the paid its not fair and not benefits can scare many people"
good,Working at Barnes and noble was a wonderful experience. My management team and co workers were like family. I would recommend Barnes and noble to anyone seeking employment.
good,I worked here temporarily for two months. It was such a great learning experience. Everyone there is friendly and always goes out of there way to ensure Barnes and Noble has financial stability.
good,"B&N offers a very friendly and professional work culture. Management is wonderful and always a pleasure to work with. Unfortunately there are not that many chances for advancements and with recent changes, hours have been drastically reduced."
good,Barnes and Noble is a great company to work for. I would recommend it to anyone. It's a company if you want to grow and succeed it's a place to be. It's always important to believe in the company you work for and back the product you sell.
good,I was a seasonal worker and was called back to come to work for them full time at a later date but declined it. It was a very diverse mix of people I worked with and loved that.
good,"I love my job at the bookstore. Our campus is small and we don't have much for student affairs, so we are a low volume store with only 3 employees but I would recommend to every college student to apply for their bookstores since it is a convenient and flexible job that is very understanding of the working conditions needed for a healthy college schedule."
good,"The job was full time during peak season, but then you dropped to part-time. You could be stocking, be a cashier, ship packages, help a customer with books or merchandise."
good,I worked at one of the college bookstore and we hardly got paid anything. other than that I  liked working there. it was clear the GM didn't know what she was doing.  they were really flexible with my school schedule and it was a good environment overall.
good,"Great environment to be around people, if you like customer service and helping people. It’s easy to learn and trainers are more then happy to help train. The environment is fun and people get along nicely"
good,"My experience at Barnes and Noble has shaped my work ethic. I wish to only see this company prosper even if I someday choose to leave my storefront. The customer service was my favorite part. Helping others find what they need and fulfilling my position brought pride to my sense of bein,"
good,I transferred from one store to another and spent the bulk of my time at the second location. Because the store was small it was a very hands on experience. I learned that it was publishers were those responsible for the prices of books and I took more pride in how our store did to meet our goal. It was a great experience.
good,"While a good part time work place, it isn't somewhere easy to make a career at. Managment changes often. The job itself is enjoyable and good for part timing."
good,"Primary day-to-day function is attentive customer service. In the music/movies department, customers have very distinct tastes in entertainment during a time period when products go in and out of manufacturing cycles very quickly. Getting a customer a concrete answer about a specific item they're searching for is one of the most challenging and rewarding aspects of working in this department; especially when the result is finding the exact album or film the customer was searching for. Often, customers will be searching for specific recordings of songs or old films/shows/cartoons they grew up with. Our company has a broad selection available and seeing a customer's face light up with excitement when they finalize a purchase is empowering. Knowing customers will be able to live through a positive time in their life again and also share a wonderful piece of art with others is the exact reason why I strive as hard as I do to ensure a sale."
good,Calm work environment. Management's chill for the most part you just do your job duties and clock out. Nothing too stressful. Usually your customer are students
good,I will always think of Barnes and Noble as a second home. I was lucky to work with the same basic team all eight years and knew they had my back. I will hope to remain in some capacity as part time or seasonal if I can work it out. I had to look for something else when new hires are not far behind me in pay and I have years on them in experience.
good,If you are in college and need some extra pay this is a great place to build basic work skills before graduation. The staff consists of an amazing group of individuals that are diverse and talented. Management is excellent and always available to answer questions regarding work schedules or the overall work environment in general.
good,Very quick paced. All of my coworkers were phenomenal and so were the regulars. High expectations are set and are achievable but may intervene with personal life. Would recommend as a stepping stone job.
good,"Being a cafe server is not hard, but it is a lot of work the drinks are not very hard to make and even if you are stuck you have many people to support you. There will be times where you will be frustrated, even overwhelmed but you will not be alone, everyone there even the book sellers are there to help you."
good,"Working at Barnes and Noble is very rewarding, fun, and you get to interact with all different kinds of people and help them with what they are looking for, as well as help them discover new things. You create a sort of family with your co-workers, and managers are always there to help."
good,"Helping students find books and checking them out."
good,They had two type of positions either a person do cashier and putting back stock out or working the floor putting back stock and helping customers with finding and organizing books
good,"Temporary job, seasonal. At a college bookstore, so big rush for one week then it died. Great team and management, hope to be called back for the next season."
good,"Barnes & Noble is an excellent place to work. A down to earth work environment, and a great place to meet interesting people from around Topeka. A typical day consists of assisting customers with their needs via phone or in person, and maintaining store cleanliness and neatness. Management is enjoyable and friendly. The hardest part is feeling over-worked because hours keep getting cut, and you sometimes have to be in 5 places at once. It gets bad when you have an impatient customer that doesn't care about situations beyond your control. The most enjoyable part of working at Barnes & Noble is the peaceful environment, the delicious smells from the café, and the smile you get to put on someone's face."
good,"The job was Receiving, simple enough. Take the boxes from the shippers, count them in, scan them and start unloading all the books. You will touch everything that B&N will sell because you handle all that in the back. The management was kind and communicative, coworkers were nice, some not. It was a huge store so it was nice to have space. The downside was that I had no position to move up to so receiving day and night got to me. Eventually the magic wears off that your now working at THE bookstore of our time. I enjoyed it though, books helped me with my life and I felt books could save the world. But in my line of duty it was saving the world, box by box, beep by beep, book by book..."
good,Overall I don't really have anything positive or negative to say about barnes and noble. The management could use some improvement due to the fact that work scheduling was always a lil lazy and delegations of jobs was a bit chaotic at times.
good,"I was a student at a university when I got the job, so the hours were flexible according to my schedule. I enjoyed it and the people, very fast paced."
good,"If you enjoy reading or movies, this is the job for you. It is basically a part time position, but opportunities for advancement do come up (such as lead in the cafe or at cashwrap). The discount is great and the mangers are awesome."
good,I enjoyed working for Barnes and Noble and hope to again. They are a supportive and flexible workplace. I also enjoyed the customer and my coworkers.
good,"After clocking in for the shift, previous coworkers tend to set you up for success. Learned a lot about efficient customer service, time management, and staying calm during times of chaos. The hardest part of the job is maintaining a consistent work schedule. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with great coworkers and seeing customers happy with the product sought after."
good,"My team is amazing and the culture is not only preached but they walk the talk also. Caring and compassionate, supportive and fun - I have never worked for a better company in my twenty years of managing."
good,The cafe is a fun and fast paced enviornment to work in. The work is enjoyable and the co-workers are friendly. Management is also good.
good,Barnes and Noble Booksellers was an amazing first job. The work was straight forward and once you knew the layout of the store it was easy. The discount made any stressful times worth while.
good,"I worked here while in college.  I"" met many people here who I continue to be connected to.    It was a good experience in customer service.  These skills have transferred over to my after college careers                                                                                                                "
good,"I enjoy working for Barnes and Noble, more than any other place of employment before. Currently we are dealing with low labor hours, so hours are tight for everyone, but I still think they are a wonderful place of employment. I just wish at my current store, there was more room for advancement, I like to learn new things, continue to grow, and here I do not see that happening. But for anyone needing a job, and just wanting to find somewhere dependable, and with amazing managers to help support you, this is the place to go. I have never been so happy with a crew in any of my previous jobs."
good,"B&N is an amazing place to work if you are looking for part time or just some extra cash, they were extremely flexible with my second work schedule."
good,"flexible hours"
good,"A typical day at work would be that, I would start off on the cash register and then I would go and start fixing a the each of the best seller books, so that they can look presentable. I think the biggest thing that I learned would that, its okay to ask for help and that everything is an experience. I think that I had the best managers because they help me get through the hardest moments. Like for example when I moved to the children section of my job, I gad trouble locating a books and giving them to the customers but they helped me do such a great job with how to locate give the best experience to the customers. My co-workers were very helpful and we worked together as a team to get the job done. The most amazing experience for me is when the customer is satisfied with my work because I gave them the best of me and gave them what they want."
good,"Working for Barnes and Noble is a pleasure. There are projects, deadlines, decisions to make, and problems to solve, but the pressure is low. The environment simply can't be beat. Cross training and multitasking keeps things engaging and interesting, and the management is flexible regarding family, school, and second jobs. Base pay is low, but the benefits are excellent."
good,My time at Barnes and noble was short but it was a great learning experience for me. Great job for college students. The management was nice and understanding when it came to my school scheduled.
good,"Working around books, and with people who share the same passion for reading and learning, is the most rewarding aspect of the job.  It's a great environment, with good opportunities for advancement. The company is also branching out into new product avenues, as to draw in a larger demographic and react to a market that is turning away from brick and mortar bookstores and toward online shopping."
good,Had a wonderful Christmas session with Barns and Noble. Was really hoping to be made a full-time employee. Management was great and friendly. Coworkers were some of the best.
good,"Even though this was only a seasonal position, I was able to learn a lot. Meet new people, and expand my customer service experience here."
good,"An amazing place to work, whether you're cashier, customer service, or stocking. The staff is amazing and easy to get along with, and always willing to help. I learned so much at that job, and hope to advance from Seasonal."
good,"I've had many jobs in my life and this was my favorite job by far. I love books, movies and music and getting to work amongst all of those everyday, and chat with customers about what we loved was the best part of my job. I learned so many countless things and books and movies, and how the book industry works. I am vey grateful to have had this experience and was so sad having to leave. Sadly, there was no Barnes and Noble in the town I moved to or I would have transferred."
good,"Barnes & Noble College is a great place to work for college students. They work around your schedule, and all workers make the work environment fun."
good,Working in environment that promtes the great past time of reading is great. Helping customers find the right book for themselves or for a gift was very rewarding.
good,"I loved working for Barnes and Noble. Everyone was so nice, laid back and patient with me while I learned on the job. I would arrive, say hello to almost everyone in the store, put away my things in the back, clock in and start work! I would make coffee, serve food in the cafe, and cause smiles everywhere. My manager was lovely, and the big boss was stern but nice as well.The best part about the job was definitely my co-workers, everyone was just so nice. The hardest part was learning all the recipes of the coffee on the job."
good,"This is an excellent work environment for students. You're immersed in culture and people from all walks of life. Great place to meet new people, build relationships and network."
good,"It was a fun, work experinece and the people I worked with was very friendly. I really enjoyed this job because I literally always had something to do and it was not any boring work."
good,"Through out the day I answered the phones, schedule appointments, and assisted customers. I learned how to help customers by scheduling appointments for them with the hair stylist. My co-workers and I worked well together and they appreciated me as an assistant. The hardest part of the job was having to eat lunch on the clock so that I wouldn't miss a call or customer. The most enjoyable part of the job was the face to face interaction I received with the customers."
good,"I enjoyed my 5 years as a student and patron of the Barnes and Noble store, and I also enjoyed my one year as an employee. I learned to work with a team as well as work individually and I also learned to do work efficiently at a fast moving pace."
good,"Work was very predictable. Management was top notch and I would be happy to work for them again. Co-workers were professional. The hardest part of the job was the lack of steady hours, or a steady schedule. The most enjoyable part is assisting people to find their interests in books."
good,Good place to work. Great hours and good people. Management was on top of things. I loved working in the back with the returns. I mostly was in the back packing old books up to go back to their vendors. I worked my own pace and my co workers were helpful when I needed help.
good,Customer service and helped cashier. I learned how to interact with different people within customer service environment. The Co workers made the job a great experience.
good,"Typical days at Barnes and Noble involves constant and consistent customer service. It also includes shelving product and maintaining merchandise presentation throughout the shift."
good,"Working for a Barnes and Noble college bookstore is different than a regular one, especially when working in the Textbooks Departement. Working with textbooks combineds customer service with labor-oriented work. In this department, most employees are given typical and simple jobs, while a select few are expected to go above and beyond what is required, which also includes manager responsibility a paperwork, all while receiving no additional compensations. Some workers maintain the role of a supervisor without being properly promoted to said position."
good,Working in bookstores was my favorite retail position. I am a writer and book enthusiast so there really was no better place for me
good,"In New York City, Barnes and Noble is in a retreat mode."
good,"I've worked in 3 different stores with Barnes & Noble, and by far my first store is still my favorite.  I realized that the management makes the biggest difference!  My personality fit a lot better with the staff at the first store than the stores I transferred into."
good,"I love my job at Barnes and Noble! I have moved up from a very part time bookseller to the Digital Sales Lead (which is the highest paid non-managerial positon available) in eighteen months. I am also currently participating in managerial training. The work is enjoyable and both my co-workers and the customers are awesome. Retail hours are a hard way of life, however, and I feel that I need something somewhat closer to what is considered regular hours."
good,Shifts usually include either customer service desk or the cashier's station alternating through the week.
good,I enjoyed working with customers. I learned plenty about the book selling industry and how competitive it is.
good,"Working at Barnes And Noble Booksellers in Troy Alabama is a fulfilling experience. The work environment is very peaceful, which allows me to have a very productive day in the workplace. Management is organized and situated to where employees are clocked out on a timely manner. They are also given ample amount of time for a break, if need be. Barnes and Noble motivate their workers to strive for excellency within the business."
good,I only worked a seasonal job but I found the employees and management very supportive. I appreciated their get togethers every other week or so to keep us all up to date with out having to learn new things second hand.
good,I wish I could get a part-time job there.the management was friendly and kept an honest store.
good,Great place to work. Great environment and management. Definately opportunity to advance.
good,"I loved working at Barnes and Noble. It's a pretty laid back job. You give great customer service, put away books, sometimes run the cash register and so forth."
good,Working at Barnes & Noble was exciting and always had events going on for the adults and children. I learned about so many books and what they consisted of. Working with the public was just awesome.
good,"Working at Barnes & Noble is a lot of fun, the people there are great, you can get regular customers who seek you out for recommendations which is always rewarding. But at the end of the day, it's retail. That means work-life balance isn't really there and compensation is only okay. If you can sacrifice some of that for a genuinely rewarding job, then it's worth it."
good,Working at Barnes been amazing. Everyone is so friendly and inviting. The employees are always willing to help a fellow coworker or a customer.  Sometimes it can be a little overwhelming when there are not enough people staffed for the day but the managers always pitch in and help and other employees are willing to come in a help.
good,"A typical day at Barnes and Noble can be a bit stressful when there's a lot of people or when we have a rush, but overall it's a peaceful, calming environment. My managers are very understanding of me and my personal life and how it correlates with work life. I've learned to make drinks and ring people up on the cashier really fast. Workplace culture is really cool, everyone is very expressive through their clothes, hair, tattoos, ect., which I like. The hardest part of the job is when we get rushes of people. My most enjoyable part of the job is honestly just being there."
good,"I really do like my job for the most part. Obviously, I like to read- a lot. So, the discount is nice. I’m also a member and proud to be. You’ll learn by working there that those memberships help keep your beloved bookstore running. The company is good to its employees, but also the authors. They eat the cost of the majority of the discounts that their members enjoy. The membership helps balance out some of those costs. So, yes, it’s a bit of a competition, mostly with other stores in the district to get memberships and sell well. But it’s rewarding to know that less of these stores will close, with the help of its eager employees. You should feel good working for a company who has procedures like this in place in order to stay open and current for its community . The staff is usually positive and it’s a place where everyone works together to have success at thee d of the day."
good,"I worked here as a temporary bookseller for the holidays. I loved it. The staff was awesome, everyone was so nice and helpful. Management was also awesome and very easy to get along with, and communicate with if needed to. I would recommend this job during the holidays to anyone looking to make a little extra cash! Only small thing I wasn't a fan of was pushing the memberships to people, and having them getting so irritated with you that they just leave and end up not buying anything. I think over pushing the memberships like we're told to do may not be conducive to selling all the other products in the store."
good,"Fun place to work with great discounts! Lots of activities to get involved with and being in the know on new titles is always an added bonus. Can get a little boring during the slow season, but then you can get a lot of other work done - such as shelving or clearing out old titles."
good,"I opened a store back in 2007, before the internet ruined book buying. But working in the store was laid back when it was slow and time flew when it was busy. Customers, are always gonna think they're right and be obnoxious. But the coworkers were the best. Loved my time there."
good,"I worked here during college, same for most of my coworkers. They always worked to accomodate my schedule. While the store did shift through management a few times, it was for good reason because the original store manager was not a good manager Every manager I had after him was amazing and we were all a big family that worked well together."
good,good place to work i would i enjoy it. you will enjoy working here if you like fast paced work and good benefits and a great team environment. Good pay as well
good,"Since starting with the company in 2008 I’ve had an excellent experience. There was only one store that I worked at out of the 4 that had any issues and that was due to poor management. Otherwise it’s been the most comfortable, active, and reasonably challenging workplace I’ve ever had the pleasure to work. "
good,"It was like an extended family and I found the even on the busiest of days, it still felt leisure. "
good,"The atmosphere is congenial, and while there is work to do, it is not backbreaking or stressful, and it does help make the time go faster. Also, employees are allowed breaks and time for lunch."
good,Great place to work. Maybe not temp but very fast pace and always something do. Hard at a College during rush week but overall a good experience for a college student plus full round discounts even when not working.
good,Barnes and nobel is a great place to work. I learned so much goid for starting out maybe not a career if you like money. If you love to read need a second income then this is for you. Pop cultuer relavent enviorment so find your inner nerd and someone will relate.
good,"This place is fair, but the pay isn't high enough for anyone looking for a decent living. It's more of a second job. You have to do what you're told and listen while you are being trained. Remember everything - or as much as you can - in whatever you learn. This will prevent you from asking unnecessary questions. Ask questions when needed, and don't try to do anything if you are, in any way, unsure of how to do it. Always ask first, because you may mess something up, and you'll be held accountable. This is a customer service job - where your aim is to satisfy every customer (as much as you possibly can) - so you don't want to mess up anything that can affect any customers or other employees - since they are doing the same goal you are playing. Get along with employees, but don't try to micromanage or ""boss"" anyone, especially people your own age. People in their early adulthood ages tend to strive to be ""the boss"" because they want to quickly rise up to management level, even when they are just beginning like you."
good,"Incredibly fun, great place to work if you consider yourself nerdy. Everyone is great with each other, it's like it's one big family. Plus books and coffee/tea! How better can life get? I went in knowing absolutely NOTHING about coffee. I had wonderful coworkers and trainers to get me up to speed and I had a TON of fun being a barista."
good,"The managers at the store I work in, were very knowledgeable and willing to teach you. The store ran smoothly and everyone worked as part of a team. Sure there were times when things got busy and hectic but we handled it well. We were always trained to make our customers our primary focus. I work there part time. I have worked different positions and it is great but the pay could be a lot better. That being said the discount we get really helps me stay a bookworm and their book-borrow program is amazing."
good,"B & N was a very relaxing and laid back job. Pay was okay for a Book Seller. The most enjoyable part was probably everything. On days when there were hardly any customers, you were able to walk around and sit and read a book."
good,"I loved working there. The management was really awesome and friendly, and they really treated me like family there. What I didn't like was the corporation as a whole I don't blame the managers for that, I just hate the corporation in general"
good,"My job at Barnes & Noble was a temporary, part-time, summer job. The management was great, as were the workers. The pay wasn't fantastic, but it was a part time job (what else would you expect?)."
good,"Barnes & Noble is a fantastic company to work with. The managers are flexible with requested vacations or days off, my fellow peers are fun to be around, and the actual work is very rewarding."
good,"Great place to work. I had to leave because my personal life had circumstances that required me to take time off of work and decided to give my 2 week notice. My Job title was as a cafe server but working in the cafe was not the type of job that fit me very well. Fast paced, very little room to breathe in-between customers and daily assigned tasks."
good,Barnes & Noble was an exciting place to work with a culture based on a love of literature and hard work. This is a fantastic place to work with growth opportunity that I would recommend to anyone interested.
good,"I love this company, but the buyers and marketers don't seem to understand what works for a bookstore and what doesn't in some respects. Great as a part time job while in college, the managers seem to actually care about the booksellers and the culture within the store is great."
good,"As a manager, I have a lot of things on my plate to accomplish, but I really enjoy the culture, talking with book-loving customers, and the team atmosphere.  The only issue is that Barnes and Noble pays bottom of the barrel for your salary."
good,"An average day of work as a receiving manager consists of balancing out the constant flow of books coming in and going out and keeping everything running smoothly, effectively, and accurately.Organizing and sorting products to proper placements. Also my responsibility, delegating tasks to my team to see that everything was accurately received and sorted. I was able to expand and improve as a managerial skills reviewing my team and working on improving productivity. Management was exceedingly friendly and very easy to work with. One of the hardest part working there was , I often felt as though there was a lack of communication amongst the store manager and assistant managers, as well as corporate to stores. What i most enjoyed about working for the company was the friendly environment of staff, working with the best team i could ask for, as well as observing the new product as it came in."
good,"Barnes and Noble was a fun and calming work environment.  They were pretty intense about customer service and up-selling. However, you receive a lot of recognition for good work.  Management was caring and supportive."
good,"Great Company."
good,The environment its nice to work and there is also camaraderie among the staff and management. An opportunity to have a part-time job and walk to the classes (my case).
good,"Great place to work, staff are the best at almost every location. Corporate side has been on the downfall however, which is why I've decided to move on. I do recommend Barnes and Noble to new workers who dont want too many hours on their plate. The discount is really amazing and you feel at home while working."
good,"I love selling books and that's what drew me to Barnes & Noble. It was always my favorite moment when someone would say they were looking for a book but had minimal information regarding the book, but we had it in stock, or could order it, and we could send a customer out the doors very happy that they got their book!"
good,"This way by far my favorite job i ever had. They pay wasn't the best, and management was in their own bubble, but as someone who is passionate about books, this was heaven. we got to rent out books and get advanced copies, it was amazing!"
good,Barnes and Noble was a good part time job to have in addition to a full time job. They kept the schedule the same every week so it was manageable for planning purposes.
good,"You have to straighten up the store, restock shelves and put up displays. Things are pretty straightforward and structured with enough leeway to augment things as needed. The people are super fun to work with and the managers are fairly understanding and willing to work with you when they can. Customer service is a huge part of the job and multitasking can help. I've learned about efficiently performing tasks and being able to help difficult customers and situations."
good,I loved my job! Everyone was wonderful kind people. There was always room to learn something new and no day was the same as the day before. You are able to interact with college students and adults and everyone makes the most of it.
good,"The people I worked with were helpful and very nice, I enjoyed working with the customers, learned new skills. My manager was great."
good,I learned a lot about order and purchasing merchandise. The workplace culture was AWESOME I absolutely enjoyed going to work and making the store a pleasant place to come and shop.
good,"This is a great place to work.  Management works with you any way, including training, making you feel comfortable and appreciable, as a team member.  Got great experience working with the public.."
good,"If you work full-time for Barnes and Noble, you can kiss your social life goodbye. I'm sure with all retail its the same. It is worst if you are a manager or head cashier. You can expect to leave the store anywhere from midnight to two in the morning, if you are closing."
good,"Barnes & Noble is probably the best retail job out there. It is most certainly a retail job, meaning holidays are very stressful, but I've always been surrounded by terrific and smart co-workers and management teams."
good,"*I worked at a Barnes and Noble that was part of a university*"
good,"Fun, fast-paced, cafe inside of Barnes & Noble. Great management team, wonderful coworkers, even got a sweet discount (50% at cafe, 30% everything else in the store) which I was very thankful for, especially during the holidays. Only downside to the position was the seasonal status of the position as well as the longer hours."
good,Worked customer service. Managed a team of 7-10 people. Ordered textbooks for in bulk for college students. great customer relation with collage staff. Paid invoices and made purchase orders. Hardest part of the job was first week of school. It will get busy with long lines. but was able to learn to be quick on the register and on the sales floor.
good,I loved working there. My store was a college texts book store and I got hired on for rush which is when school is about to start. After that was over I got let go but then they asked me to come back for the holidays and ended up staying on until I moved. I would have transferred but the closest store was hours away from where I moved to.
good,"A great place to work surrounded by books. Daily challenges to help customers find just the right items. New books delivered almost daily! There is always something to do, change, set up or learn. Management encourages ideas to promote the store or increase sales. Have a question? Just ask, we are a team environment!"
good,"Please just learn the shelving system and help pick-up as my fellow coworker. The job is mostly clean-up, shelving, helping customers, and keeping the bookstore organized. You learn some respect about where things go."
good,The team is great. Just needed higher pay. Unbelievably accommodating to my schedule. The management was incredibly kind. My coworkers were a delight to work with.
good,"I like the thursday, I learned the hiring processing ( very professional ), management very friendly, multiple cultures, I don't like the ---etb line---( it's when you drop the boxes on the line), and I love when the group work united."
good,It was a good environment to work in and very flexible with breaks and scheduling. Nice managers for the most part. Cafe was nice to work in but I felt I couldn't move up at all onto the book floor.
good,I work with people i go to school with and interact with different types of people. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know my customers so well just by little conversations every day.
good,I really loved the work environment and other employees at Barnes and Noble; you really become part of a family there. The customer service aspect takes its toil eventually but the fellow employees help balance it out.
good,This is such a wonderful place to work and I would recommend it to anyone who loves a great work atmosphere with great management. All of my coworkers are awesome people.
good,"It was a great job, my very first in retail. I stayed on for the holidays and I had a great work experience. The managers really looked out for everyone and helped us when we had trouble with anything."
good,Staff is well educated but under motivated to accomplish demands of retail today. Multiple HR violations throughout store. Good community involvement.
good,"I never felt overworked. However, I did feel a bit useless from time to time because the work was so slow. I got plenty of time off, but the pay was minimum wage which is not so good."
good,In this job I spent most of my time helping customers and sorting the the book inventory system. This is a nice job if you enjoy interacting with and helping people.
good,"This job is fun, exciting and busy. I enjoy it very much, Meeting all the interesting people everyday is a plus."
good,Working at Barnes and Noble has been the best job I've come across so far. My coworkers are amazing and the job is so fun. This job has helped me with my customer service skills as well as customer relations. You will become familiar with all the regulars and know their orders by heart.
good,"All co-workiers are always there to help one another. The managers chip in too. No matter what problems there are, they seem to get resolved rather quickly. There doesnt seem to be a hard part of the job. Actually the hardest part is saying no to helping an employee or manager"
good,"Working at the bookstore is fun, they have a good discount for employees and with all of the different products that the sell the discount works wonders."
good,It was a fun place to work though it was just part-time. The managers were amazing and really assisted with the employees. It felt more about the quality of the experience with the product and customers than just the quantity. All my co-workers were there out of love for books.
good,"I enjoyed working at Barnes & Nobles. Most of the employees were young students, so we all had a similar mind set and goals. Also management was great, and very understanding with school schedules. It was just hard to move up at this location,and they did not provide alot of hours."
good,"If you are looking for a job where your bosses are understanding and you will learn a lot, you will love this job. I was only there as a temporary employee but I enjoyed my experience."
good,"Working as a bookseller at Barnes and Noble was extremely fulfilling. It was a fun environment to learn and help customers. A typical day at work consists of cashiering, helping customers locate specific books and/or nonspecific titles that they may be interested in. I learned how to explain synopsis in under a minute, how to organize sections, and how to navigate a store. My co-workers were very relaxed and very book smart. The hardest part of the job was trying to identify a specific title with an extremely vague description. The most enjoyable part of the job was suggesting a book that had personal meaning to a new reader and watching them fall in love with it."
good,"Barnes and Noble College is a very enjoyable work environment. They are very flexible with my classes, and are always teaching me something new. Since I've been at B&NC I've learned to process online orders, cancel orders and how to process refunds online and at the register. My co-workers are also students we help each other learn new job task and also wit school work."
good,"I was able to have a great relationship with my managers. My co-workers were easy to get along with as well, it was a like a family in Barnes and Noble. With a part time job as a full time student, this job was one of the best I have had. Managers were understanding of my schedule, it wasn't difficult work that stressed me out, it was a good balance between my education and work."
good,"This was the job I liked the most; I was with them for over 11 years.  Great balance and culture.  Unfortunately, it was retail.  Having a 50% discount on cafe' items and access to new book & music titles was an awesome perk.  Miss this place and the clientele.  Great starter job.  Very classy."
good,"It is easy to work at one company for 18 years when it is Barnes & Noble.  This company has had to reinvent, adjust and adapt many times over the years.  In that sense, I have worked for many variations of B&N.  It is a pleasure to work with such well read, adventurous and enjoyable professionals."
good,I enjoy the workplace and I particular working with people..
good,"It was a good working experience. Learned many practical skills used in the job force, such as operating a cash register and talking to people."
good,"At Barnes and Nobel , I work at the main store in Manhatten.  The personnel were friendly and helpful wheneve you had questions about orders and customers requests."
good,A solid place to begin a career or to work while going to school.
good,"I went to work early so the pace was somewhat slow but would pick up during the late afternoon. Speeding up my pace when crowds arrived was challenging but fun and gave me a lot of learning experience. My manager was pleasant, polite, and understanding. My coworkers where friendly and retable. The others were quiet and kept to themselves.The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the public and being surrounded by the thing I love most which is books."
good,I really mean that little to now drama. management is understanding and helpful. co-workers are easy to get along with. most customers are fun and easy to work with
good,I love working at Barnes and Noble. It is a stress-free environment and filled with friendly faces. I learned how to run a cash-wrap and close up my section of the store.
good,"Barnes & Noble was the most fun place to work, but also the most financially challenging. I started at minimum wage, and ended slightly above that. Otherwise, this was by far my most favorite place of occupation."
good,"great place to work at"
good,"A typical day at the CCSU Bookstore involves receiving the daily UPS delivery and putting the books or supplies away, all the while helping serve any and all customers coming into the store, either by helping them locate items for purchase, or ringing them out at the front register."
good,Some custimers are pretty rude they don't give you time to do anything.
good,"This job was definitely so much fun, I love making coffee drinks. I got super close with my co-workers as well as a few regular customers! There was never a dull moment at work and I was always excited to go to work. The toughest part about the job would be trying to keep up on extremely busy days with two people working. A typical day goes really smooth, I loved early morning shifts. Your regulars come in and you already know what they want and it's heart warming to see their reactions when you remember their orders."
good,"This job ended up becoming more of a home away from home. I learned a lot about history, literature and classic novels. I definitely learned a lot about dealing with people and customer service."
good,I have worked in three different Barnes and Noble stores in three different cities and each is unique to it's community. This is one of the many reasons why I came to love working for this company. I met people from all walks of life and made life long friends. The hardest part of this job was leaving.
good,"Barnes & Noble was a very interesting job. Management was great, they really cared about the employees needs and wants. I really do miss it"
good,"My day often starts at 7am when I arrive to start the opening process to be ready to open the doors at 9am. Once opened and the first morning crew member has arrived and the first rush is over, I do the morning/daily paperwork. This includes prep sheets for the baking and sandwhich pull list, schedualing, order forms and checking the store e-mail for any new updates or information from corporate. The management team at the store is in general very supportive and helpful when I or any of my cafe team have issues or problems and need asistance."
good,"Fun place to work, great people. Pay is not very high and it seems hard to move up."
good,"Organized and promoted author signings, maintained and filled school orders, created new ways to bring in customers and public exposure."
good,over all an awesome workplace filled with passionate people
good,"Loved working here, the environment, staff and customers!"
good,"People-Friendly, home-like environment, teamwork among the co-workers, met different people and cultures. Was a great experience for me."
good,"Its a fun atmosphere, very nice customers and co-workers. They are very open about working around your schedule and willing to work with you on pretty much anything."
good,Fun place to work as a first job or as a career. You have to opportunity to learn a lot and meet a ton of interesting people in the process.
good,This position was the best job I had held. The work was fulfilling and I felt as if I made a difference within the productivity of the store. I enjoyed the place I held and worked hard at being the best at it.
good,"Overall, I enjoyed my whole experience working for this Barnes and Noble. I had a supportive team, was able to work in multiple departments, and never felt locked into an individual position or routine."
good,Great team of enthusiastic and caring people who make an incredible team. Managers are receptive to opinions on how to make improvements at the store level and willing to let employees take the lead on special interest projects.
good,"The place is amazing and it's shown in how the employees act with each other and with the customers. We all get along very well and love helping the customers, There are regular customers that come in that I know by name and have gotten to know and love. It's an amazing environment and I'm very lucky to work here."
good,I would love to be considered considered my expertise in this area. I was asked to do a survery and I love the service at the barnes and noble around the corner.
good,"The store is great, the benefits are better. If you read or like pop culture it's great to just be able to learn whats on the shelves and help people out. There has only been a few occasions of toxic customers, but most of the customers are fun to chat with."
good,I enjoyed working here as a barista. The staff and management were always very nice and understanding. It was a good 1st-time job. I would recommend if you're a student
good,I love my job. The book store is awesome the people are to. I wish the job would pay more. Friendly environment and the managers are great and will help you out
good,"Von September 2006 bis November 2015 habe ich fuer Barnes&Noble gearbeitet, am selben Ort. Ich wurde in allen Abteilungen ausgebildet (Buchhandel, Musikabteilung, Kinderabteilung, Kassenfuehrung, Barista im Cafe, Wareneingang und Versand, Inventur). Das Fuehrungsteam verhielt sich immer fair, war kompetent, professionell, und Vorschlaegen und Kritik gegenueber aufgeschlossen. Es hat mir grossen Spass gemacht, fuer dieses Unternehmen zu arbeiten. Ich habe vieles ueber den Buch- und Einzelhandel in dieser Zeit gelernt."
good,"There are certain inner-system tiers for Booksellers/Baristas, like ""under 20 hours"" and ""under 40 hours"" so if you are not the higher tier, you likely won't get many hours and cannot accrue benefits. I'm a under 40 hour bookseller so I get around 35 hours a week if not in school, and 25 when in school, I've acquired around 50 hours of PTO this year by working over the average of hours. I've been here nearly two years and I love it. It's treating me well and management is incredibly understanding and tries their best to make everyone happy. Unless you know for sure you can secure good hours for yourself, it's honestly a part-time job that you pair with another part-time job in this economy."
good,"Friendly co-workers, lots of variation in tasks so you are not stuck just working with customers in one way, variation in customers needs from finding books for them to ordering to recommending."
good,"One of the best work environments I've been in, its fast-paced (at least in the cafe where I most often worked) but low stress due to always having coworkers with fun and positive attitudes.  Managers are equally enjoyable to work with and were very approachable.  I have no major complaints, but the pay rate and opportunity for advancement are areas that could be improved."
good,Loved working at B&N. I love as the number in tge district in sakes. Also I the highest in selling B&N memberships. Love all the children’s books and tge special events . Plus tge book signing.
good,I love working here. The managers were always good to me. Willing to work around school schedules. Scheduling varies from week to week. Some weeks you work a full 30 others only 8 hours depending on the schedule. Over all love it here and great discounts.
good,As a first job I got very lucky. All the employees had each others backs. Most of the management was very laid back and nice. It always seemed like a family when you worked.
good,Working with books is a fun job. Helping customers and fulfilling orders keeps you busy but the real fun is setting up the new books on Monday nights.
good,Was hired as seasonal with the possibility of advancement. Loved walking into work to the smell of coffee and the sight of all the books. The management could be more interactive with new hires and explain the positions better. You didn't know half of the events that were going on or where things were. Was a great place to work for though!
good,"Honestly, minus the hard selling of memberships, it was a fine place to work. My bosses made the job easy enough and the people that came in were mostly great people to talk to,"
good,If you love books and talking about books this is the place to be!!  If you have sales experience it helps because you are definitely engaging customers and making recommendations.  It’s fun and people are great too!
good,"I loved working at Barnes and Noble because of the relaxed environment. It can get stressful, especially in the cafe, but the job is totally worth it. I highly reccomend applying."
good,"I loved working at Barnes & Noble...the customers were great because most of them were ""book people"" and it helped create a great culture to work within."
good,Had many challenges with changing policies and leadership roles. Poorly executed strategies to enhance business. Understandably the company has attempted to leverage losses however in such short period of time. Processes to mitigate current financial stress should have been implemented while company was thriving.
good,"It was great. My location was a fun location and I’m not just saying this for fun. Out of all the jobs I worked (Receptionist, Admin Assistant, CSR Rep, Call center) this has to be the most enjoyable job I’ve ever held. The only reason why I left was that the pay at the time was absolute trash."
good,NA i dont want to say any more i want to be done with this review but i guess i just have to keep typing and i suppose this is good practice for typing quickly in an administrative assistant job which is why i am trying to use this website.
good,"This place is a dream to work at. I worked in the cafe where the time passed quickly, but I also enjoyed working on the book floor where you can browse the sections when not helping customers."
good,"every day was a new learning opportunity at barnes and noble, although trained in many sectors of the stores opportunity for growth were very low. But the company does an amazing and wonderful job recognizing their employees."
good,"Great managers, high level of interaction with customers, a variety of tasks that rotate, collaborative spirit is encouraged, staff is friendly and supportive,"
good,This job fit me perfectly.  I enjoyed researching books and music for customers.  The more difficult the request the more I liked researching it.  I would go back in a minute.
good,Every weekend I would work here and it was so fun! The cafe was not nearly as stressful as say a starbucks. Who doesnt love coffee and books. It was very relaxed and routine for me as well as collaborative. during downtime or if we had gotten all of our work done my co-workers and I would be talking about anything and everything. Very positive and like minded environment.
good,"learn how to help people from all walks of life. "
good,I found that most of my coworkers were very friendly and helpful.  The management team was great while making sure everything got done it was still a fun place to work.  It got challenging especially during the holidays but it was rarely boring.
good,"Good company to work for. Good people to work with.  Nice discount on store purchases.  Good environment, however doesn't pay much. Good place to work part time."
good,Very good to work at during school and co workers are a blast. Management is picked out very well. Even though you are pushed to sell it’s pretty easy with laidback customers and having the time to get to know their interests.
good,"I started at BN over the summer of 2018. Coming in, I didn't have a lot of customer service experience beyond working at my university's on-campus bookstore, but the staff at BN trained me to handle every aspect of customer service and I feel confident in customer service situations. I also received training for the cash-wrap and cafe, but I primarily worked the customer service desk."
good,"Barnes and Noble has always been one of my favorite places to work. The people are relaxed and we all care for each other. The job itself is not difficult, and helping customers is fun."
good,I was only there for a seasonal position but the managers were always trying to encourage you to be your best and how to improve yourself and would give some positions fun contests to compete in such as up saleing  etc.
good,The place is awesome. You want to go there everyday. It is nice. It is a fun place to be and the work is not that hard as you think it is. I have a great time there.
good,"I enjoyed working there, my coworkers were helpful and supportive, and the customers were generally kind and patient. I was glad to be able to help others pursue a passion for reading."
good,"In the time I worked there I had 5 different managers.  They were all"
good,"A great company with strong, encouraging management. I have worked in almost all departments in Barnes and I have had nothing but positive experiences."
good,"Managers and coworkers all very outgoing, great working community, satisfying work. reasonable break times, good shift availability, and discounts are really good, especially for cafe area."
good,Loved working here! Best management team. The hardest part of the job was staying on my feet all day. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people that I worked with.
good,"Enjoyed stocking, selling and working with customers regarding their book needs. Worked as a Cashier for the most part but helped all around book store."
good,Everyday was new and exciting.  It was unusual for it to be a calm day.  Really enjoyed the interaction with customers.  Management team worked well together to accomplish the goals of the store.
good,Cashiering was fun on busy days. My favorite area to work in was at the information desk. It was never boring there. The kids department sometimes got a little out of hand. I was blessed to have wonderful managers and amazing coworkers.
good,"I worked at Barnes and Noble as a freshman in college. For a part time job, I made decent money and was paid every friday. I loved working here and would recommend it to anyone."
good,Laid off after 4 years head cashier 1800 employees out of 750 stores no notice. Not even a clue.love the people customer books great team good benefits
good,"I had a blast working there.  It's hard to say anything bad about the job.  It seemed like the company really cared about you and tried its best to take care of you.  It's customer service, so you occasionally get a crazy customer."
good,"This was my first ever job. It was a temporary, part time bookseller position. The manager was awesome, my coworkers were great. I got my college books at an amazing discount, and hours are super flexible. Overall a wonderful place!"
good,"Barnes and Noble College is a great place to work as a college student. Discounts on textbooks, supplies, and merchandise were great benefits. I was able  to work and gain skills in almost all the departments. Competitive wages available, I started out above the minimum wage for the state. Opportunities for lateral movement and upward advancement. Great place to learn about the offerings of the college, community, and to network with students and professionals."
good,"Excellent place to work if you love books and have good visual spacial organization skills(knowing where things are). Another  great skill is the ability to extract information from customers, as many can't remember the title that they are looking for, so investigative skills are a plus."
good,"I loved my job at Barnes and Noble and when I got sick, both my own store managers and HR looked out for me. I felt very appreciated there. Recent changes cut several full-time positions from the stores and mine was one to go. I wasn't upset by this, however, as I was aware my position wasn't going to be around much longer."
good,"Although it is primarily for students, the environment is very relaxed and the management are very lenient towards its workers. The only difficult part is that not everyone can be kept after the first 2-3 weeks when a semester begins because the demand for books go down as soon as a majority of the population cannot be kept."
good,Fun place to work if young..its not challenging..the customers are usually pretty nice nice work environment. And thanks to the cafe the smells in  the store are great
good,"Was part-time so no benefits, but it was a great environment to work in. Competent, understanding  management. Flexible hours and a low stress environment make it a great job."
good,"Had a great time working for the company.  I began my career as a part-time bookseller, was promoted to music department lead, and then to full-time head cashier.  Both management and staff were very supportive of one another, because individual success leads to team success. I would still be with the company had corporate not deemed my full-time position part of an ""outdated staffing model."""
good,"Management is excellent. Co workers are more like family. The office and warehouse work hand in hand. Great place to work. Only negative aspects are the pay, lack of raises or bonuses."
good,Not going waste time thing of a lie. Where i worked in the back was boring. Time moved slow the discounted Starbucks and books were the only things that interested me.
good,"Fun work environment. Sometimes hectic, however mostly even paced. The duties were straight forward and easy to accomplish. Great opportunities to develop many work place skills."
good,"Great place to work for, great management and and amazing work environment. allows for some advancement all though it does tend for die down the higher you get."
good,"very nice, sometimes stressfull but like I said overall a very decent place to work. Not a lot of room for advancement which is very disappointing but it could be worse."
good,"It's a awesome place to work, everybody is great. They like to have fun and relaxing. All the people are nice and there is never any drama. I would go back and work every time."
good,"I’m working there currently as a seasonal employee. It’s usually pretty busy and everyone is really nice. I can’t work Friday, Saturday, or Monday and they still work with me!"
good,"The days were long, but passed quickly. I was always busy and loved what I did and who I worked with. Can't beat a bookstore as an ideal job! For me, anyhow!"
good,"Good place for college student or retiree.  Not a place to earn a big salary, but 20 hour employees do receive benefits.  Where else does that happen?  "
good,"It was fun, weekdays were always fun to work since it was so dead (It was dead because it was inside a mall but I do know the store itself is quite full most times) my coworkers are great and management as well. The pay in Miami is starting 9 per hour and they add 25 cents  to your paycheck every year you stay there."
good,I would totally recommend Barnes and nobles to anyone. All my coworkers were really nice and helpful. My managers were helpful also and very nice. The location was a perfect spot for me and they worked with my school schedule.
good,"I worked at the cafe in Barnes and Noble and got along with everyone hired on both book and cafe side. I was paid fairly and according to the experience I had, and learned how to make all the drinks on the menu. I also learned great customer service skills, how to work under pressure, and how to stay calm under lots of stress. Management was amazing and very understanding of everyone's situation in life and went above and beyond to help the employees advance through the day. I will say, they have lockers, but you're not assigned a locker, you're assigned a lock, and you can't keep anything in your locker overnight. My location was understaffed in the cafe, so the hardest part of the day, was just doing my work because we were constantly slammed and backed up. But I loved the people I worked with, and the overall, relaxed but professional attitude of the store."
good,I love this work place. Flexible working hours. Managers very helpful and loving to all employees. I would recommend barnes and noble any person who want to gain a retail experience.
good,"This was my favorite job!!!! I loved talking to the customers and living vicariously through many of them. I enjoyed being able to walk around the store and speak to customers. I also enjoyed when I was in charge of the children's section and was able to be creative in the displays. I was able to work in the Starbucks in the store. I really enjoyed learning how to make the coffee drinks. "
good,"Each day was a fresh challenge, I loved that every 16 weeks something new was taking place.  It was great to stay up to date on the most recent techno gadgets.  Best of all some work was very physical and some work was data entry and online orders just very computer oriented."

You get 50 percent off cafe items, 30 percent off bookstore items, and 40 percent off on employee appreciation days. I've definitely improved my communication skills while working here. The hardest part is probably pushing to sell memberships, because that's what keeps your job."
good,"I enjoyed my 15 months there.  You had access to a very generous coffee room, books, lunch rooms. The Christmas party included a sit-down dinner and Lady Gaga and Tony Bennett."
good,Working at Barnes & Noble has been an enjoyable experience since my first day. The most enjoyable parts have to be customer service and forming relationships!

good,My day consists of checking out customers after they have chosen their purchase and assisting customers in finding their merchandise. I have refined my organizational skills with this job. The management is top-notch and the workplace culture is very friendly. The hardest part of the job is dealing with shop-lifters. The best part of the job is recommending books to customers.
good,had to get a job fast and peppermll was a good fit. ended up leaving do to the fact they hired more people and was losing hours fast. besides that good job
good,"Barnes and Noble is honestly a blast to work at. Awesome managers run a team of fun booksellers. Everyone is doing a position they enjoy, because managers work to find the position that you excel at and prefer to do. I get to talk about books with customers all day, recommending my favorites or finding the perfect fit for the customer! I've been there almost two years and I want to stay!"

good,All co-workers and supervisors were nice. The store was typically busy at the beginning of the semesters. The hardest part of the job was book returns. The most enjoyable part of the job was the environment.
good,"Overall, B&N is an excellent place to work. Managers value your work and co-workers are very welcoming. They quickly become very close friends with you."

good,helping a teacher can be very rewarding but it does not pay the bills. Needs of the students and communications are a constant issue surrounding the profession.
good,"Working for Barnes & Noble was fun everyday. There were bad days, all jobs have those. But overall, I enjoyed the work. I was a barista in the cafe,and I loved making coffee and talking to the regulars. I was surrounded by coffee and books all day, was frequently asked for book recommendations by customers, and kept up to date about new releases from my favorite authors! I would have gladly spent the rest of my life in that bookstore as a barista!! My manager was amazing, we made a great team, the booksellers were always there for backup when the cafe became busy, and I learned customer service skills. The regular customers came back time and again because it really is an amazing environment! They felt as welcome as a customer as I felt as an employee! The hardest part was closing the cafe on a weekend! Sometimes you'd get swamped and people would order food right as you were shutting down the food case, but it was the best job I ever had."
good,I enjoyed working there even if it was short i got laid off because there were to many people working at there busiest time and i was the last hired but it was good.
good,Productive and fun work place with enthusiastic staff one could learn a lot from which are always welcoming and willing to help. Great balance of work/life

good,Barnes and Nobles attracts a great culture of people who both work and shop there. Even though it was stressful at times it is still one of my favorite places to have worked.
good,"Help customers either find a particular book or provide ideas that match the customers desires.  Quickly ring up any sales and report back to the floor.  Clean and organize the store as it can become quite disorganized over the course of a day.  If they need help, make drinks in the coffee shop.  At the end of the night,total store safes and tills.  If necessary, prevent theft.  The atmosphere is quite relaxed most of the time and free access to tall of the books is wonderful.  The managers and coworkers were all like friends and family. Low pay, but worth the time in my life."
good,"A typical day in the work place was fun because there were goals to reach daily. It taught me how to sell and suggest. Management was consistently communicative and helpful.

However, the pay could have been more than it was."
good,"The one thing that I loved about working here was the fact that I had the pleasure of working such a wonderful mix of different cultures.  I got to bask in the greatness of all groups of people, not only among the staff, but among the clientele as well.

good,Hardest part of job was scheduling. Schedules changed bi-weekly and were not family oriented.
good,Hardest part of this job is keep busy as it gets extremely slow. Also trying to keep from being bored is also hard as there is not much to do once all work for the day has been accomplished
good,"Barnes and Noble was a perfect part time job for me, and I learned a great deal about inventory control and the shipping and receiving department. The management was always cohesive and direct, friendly and upbeat. The communication meetings were my favorite, they boosted morale and kept everyone on the same page. I enjoyed my time there and served in many different capacities, the managers always knowing they could count on my diversity to cover any department."

good,"Typical days include cashiering, getting to speak to a lot of customers who need help finding product and working with tons of knowledgeable staff that really know how give great reading advice. This is really the most enjoyable part of the job. Talking to customers who love reading and are looking for the next big book. The hardest part is being on your feet for hours at a time and cross training with cafe staff and shelving books that have been misplaced by others."
good,Most people think working at a book store would be laid back but most days can be pretty busy. Overall it is a wonderful place to work. Pay is somewhat low and most positions are part time but the company is wonderful when it comes to having to balance your life schedule with your work. Management is some of the best I have ever had to deal with.

good,This company was my first serious job. Barnes and Noble treats their employees very well. The management and floor employees worked together to help the Lincolnshire store become successful. I was there helping open the store back in 2007. The Lincolnshire store is one of Barnes and Nobles great stores.
good,"Each day at work is something different. there are rude students that come into the bookstore complaining about the prices. But, my co-workers are good support when it comes to me having to be patient with the student customers by taking over the situation. This job teaches me to have patience with people."
good,"While some managers are ruthless, others are nice and productive. The good very much outweighed the bad. Listening to music while keeping busy doing daily tasks was simple and easy. Even when the customers would come in with an attitude, I felt that they were very much at ease when they left. The workers create a nice, warm atmosphere."
good,"Every day was spent assisting customers find books they were looking for or helping customers learn how to use their ""NOOK"". I especially enjoyed discussing with others books that we have read and having educated discussions regarding the material."
good,"Every day at work is the same, with the same routine and a lot of the same customers. Having customer loyalty is the biggest part Barnes & Nobel is still up and running. What I learned about my job and working in that type of service industry is that working with hard working and dedicated employees makes the best environment in the workplace. The hardest part of my job is dealing with employees that don't care about their job and customers that are hard to work with to complete their order. The best part about my job is a lot of my co-workers i get to work with, a comfortable work place make the best environment to do my best work."

good,I love my job at B&N. I've been with Barnes for 3 years and I've met so many amazing people (co workers and customers) and it has been one of the best experiences of my life. Of course each experience is dependent on the store but I feel very fortunate to work with such an awesome staff. Everyone is very friendly. Great part time job or just something to pick up some extra cash. There are opportunities to move up with the company but it is dependent on the area.
good,"When I first started working there, I was a bit nervous. However, when days goes by, I was able to get use to that job until weeks later that the manager decided to let me go to make room for more people who wanted this job. Sometimes around August, I am definitely working there again just because it was easy, fun, and more flexible to work at."
good,It was like any other retail job. I loved my coworkers and management was lovely. I always had a good time interacting with customers as well. Overall a wonderful experience
good,"I wasn't the best with time management, but everyone was helpful. There was always plenty of managers to help all the associates and I never felt like I was a burden even when I had a million questions or problems."
good,"I really enjoy my time here. My only problem is that there has been a few occasions where I and other coworkers have felt ""othered"" because of us being cafe workers rather than bookside sellers. Nothing major but it can be frustrating to not be considered a part of the team since we are off to the side basically. This only came from manager however and fellow coworkers were great."
good,Barnes and Noble was a great place to work. It has a really great work environment and fun upbeat coworkers and management who work with your schedule.

good,"I had a job as a barista, it was stressful to say the least because I had to make 3-5 drinks in less than two minutes to satisfy the customers. I was also hired around a busy time, but it was satisfying to get things right. Management was really good because the manager was always working alongside you. The hardest part of the job was time. The most enjoyable part of the job was the teamwork, satisfying the customers, and getting to talk to different people everyday."
good,The people there are great at helping each other. I learned quickly and and had fun doing it. There wasn't much room for growth in the store but it is a great job.
good,"The very best people make up the team at Barnes & Noble.  The training and development programs were effective, and the customer commitment was second to none."
good,I would clock in look at the schedule see where I was placed and go on from there. I was mainly the cashier so I would go to my register and begin working as a regular cashier. I learned more social skills and how to create more than regular conversations.
good,My typical day at work is spent conversing with customers and having conversations about customer's interests.  Having passionate discussions about reading and book interests is the most fun part of the job though this it can be difficult to do this all the time.  The management and workplace culture is great very responsive and often laid back.  Working here has given me new respect for books and taught me a lot about customer service as well as given me lots of new books to buy and read.
good,"An excellent place to work and learn. I works at Barnes and Noble Cafe, I learned all related to Barista, Catering and Customer Service, and working as Bookseller and Cashier I learned a lot more."
good,"I was able to call off if there was a school emergency or if I was sick. Since I am a student, the managers require me to work more than four hours a week but the times I have to work are very flexible due to my student schedule. They also can not schedule you during class times."
good,"A typical day at work would be always making sure all surfaces and areas are clean and organized, have food and drinks stocked in order to have orders ready to go, providing excellent customer service, have food and snacks in the front area always stocked and full, etc. "
good,A typical day at work was very fun. As a cashier i met all kinds of different people. Each with there own interesting opinions. My co workers were very kind and understanding as well as friendly.
good,"All jobs have their ups and downs but, this job is great. Co-workers are a team.  Management is great, and they get in and work hard with you.  Discounts are a nice plus.  Would recommend my Store to anyone that would like to work there."
good,"The moment I started at Barnes and Noble, I knew it was something special. The managers understood that mistakes were part of a learning curve and didn’t expect complete perfection right off the bat. Everyone there is really kind, and the pacing is a lot easier to handle than traditional retail or food service."
good,Working at Barnes and Noble is a great job. It is fast paced but if it is a slow day we are able to get other important things done. The company is very family oriantatedas well.
good,"I loved this job! The employees are great, the discount is SO worth it, and the hours are mostly minimal, which is both good and bad. It was a relaxing environment, except through the holidays, when it gets crazy like most retail places. It's a fun place to work, and I definitely recommend it!"
good,I worked in the café area so my experience is specific to that.  I loved my job because as a barista I liked the pace in the bookstore; most are there to shop so I was able to chat with guests about books or their day verses getting their coffee and leaving. My specific location had fantastic management and I never dreaded working any shift because all my coworkers were great.

good,"Barnes and Noble was my first serious job and it paid pretty well for minimum wage. I had a very good team of managers, employees and people who helped run the business. I thrived there and was very happy to be there. I love books, am great with people, and can handle myself well under pressure. The overall environment was very familiar since I've been a full-time student for most of my life, and still am. The only drawbacks were that the store manager that hired me ended up taking paternity leave and his replacement was a horrible and mean-spirited person. But what really made me leave was that I was no longer getting sufficient hours and had to seek employment elsewhere. I have been told that the new store manager at the location I worked at is much better and nicer to her employees than the last one and that the hours have been improved. Since the job was perfect except for those very two reasons and they are no longer a problem, I would happily return."
good,"I worked with a great team. Everyone was very friendly and we all liked to have fun. "
good,"Typical day of work consists of retail tasks such as stocking product and a fair amount of problem solving for customers, I have learned to carefully listen to customers since their recollections are often vague or incorrect, management is excellent, our workplace culture is supportive and often fun, the hardest part of the job would be the physical nature of working with large numbers of books and the repetitive nature of stocking shelves, for me the most enjoyable part of the job is being with lots of people."

good,"It was fine, the people were great but the hours were a joke, 5-15 hours per weak if you're lucky. The regular customers made the job what it was. plus cheap coffee"
good,"Altogether an excellent place to work. In general, customers were extremely appreciative and thankful for our assistance in finding books. Co-workers were very friendly and managers gave helpful training advice. Was able to learn about newly written literature and literature new to me."
good,"A typical day for me in the bookstore is helping students and teachers find their books for their courses and assisting them in their check out process. I learned how to organized books, the return  process, restock, and others. My manager was a person that takes care of you all the time. The workplace culture is rich because we work with books and different students with different career paths. Sometimes the hardest part was costumers that couldn't get their money approval and they couldn't get their books. The most enjoyable part of the job is the different things you can learnd from books."

good,"A day here is pretty relaxed except during busy times (beginning of a semester."
good,"Working in the stores is challenging and rewarding. Being able to assist customers in locating products and maintaining company image is vital. Working at a corporate level is demanding and competitive, but there is room to change departments and learn new skills."

So I appreciate the opportunity that Barnes and noble gave to me
good,"Barnes and Noble has been by far my favorite job I have ever had. The team player attitude of the management and employees helped foster a family-like environment. I really felt like I was a part of something bigger, and that just my small achievements were a big part of our combined success. I loved the business structure, the customers, and the ability to advance my career further inside the company. Would definitely work there again if possible!"

good,"Absolutely loved this job! You get to work in an environment where you can share your love for books with others. The employee discount was pretty sweet (30% off books and other stuff, 25% Music and DVD, 50% off cafe items). Hardest thing for me was shelving, it gets really tedious sometimes to put books away because there are a lot of books and its a huge store. Otherwise I loved working here, great team building and the management really helped!!"
good,"The Executive level was very concerned and involved with all Booksellers and Corporate Level associates.  I partnered with many different internal departments daily along with coordinating with many different providers.

These interactions allowed me to grow professionally, as I became a viable resource to many different colleagues within the company.  "

good,I've worked here for over a year now and I love it. While the management can get a bit wonky at times (as with every job) everyone who works there gets a long great and the management truly listens to you and will work with you if you have a schedule (or any) issue. What truly makes the job worth it is definitely my coworkers and the excitement on people's faces when they get the book they want.
good,"Worked for B&N in three states in a variety of positions. Flexible schedules, great co-workers in a laid back environment. Good training, lots of challenges and opportunity to learn new positions if interested."
good,I absolutely love working for Barnes and Nobles. Its a great place to work and if they offered me a full time position I would take it in a heart beat.
good,"Having the ability to satisfy a customer with their favorite drink and our wonderful pastries brightens my day. As a consumer of Starbucks products myself, I do understand the importance of feeling welcomed and accommodation when something is not to my standards. I am grateful to have a management team that cares about their employees and are willing to work with your personal needs. It is very important to have a staff that is willing to work together to achieve a goal, and provided when needed. At times it can become hectic during our high volume hours as well as when under staffed, fortunately communication between co-workers is always there to have a smooth running cafe."
good,"If you love books and pop culture you will love working for the place. It is more so for college aged students who need money for life's extras, but may not be a good fit for someone who has a full run of bills or a head of household."
good,"I wouldn't say its a place to work forever, though it is an easy atmosphere and the years just seem to fly by. I keep coming back because they are a great company."
good,"I haven't enjoyed working for a company as much as I had at Barnes & Noble. I built great relationships with all of the customers and staff, and genuinely enjoyed the work I performed each day. My dedication was appreciated and I was promoted several times throughout my career there. The benefits, including health and dental were very affordable, and the paid time off was fair and adequate. I would certainly recommend the company to anybody who is interested in customer service with the opportunity to climb the corporate sales ladder."
good,"I really liked working at Barns and Nobles, some day are slow and some are fast.My co-workers and i worked together as a team to complete each task and management was awesome."
good,"For someone who loves to read, work with books and talk with people who have similar interests working here is perfect. I love going into work every day because I know it's going to be different every time. There will be new people looking for books that interest them and I get to help them find something good to read. Most of the management team is amazing. I have had a good bond with many managers will working here and it makes the experience that much better. I also love my coworkers, we're all mostly working here for the same reasons and so sharing interests with them is a great environment."
good,"In a cafe environment such as this one, you learn how to stay composed under pressure, produce great customer service, the importance for team work and building, also including utilization of multitasking."
good,It was a great company full of an amazing staff and fun management team. my most enjoyable part of my job was coming in and seeing my co-workers and enjoying each shift.
good,I loved working with B&N. Best job I've ever had! The people I worked with became my family and I was able to laugh and enjoy my days. The managers were always there to help me continue to learn and listen to what I had to say. I only left because I moved. I would go back in a heartbeat.
good,"It was one of the best jobs I've had. I would highly recommend people to work here. Management is great, everyone communicates with each other well, and everyone works together to get work done. I loved that. Only complaint: not a lot of hours to go around. If you're a manager, it gets better. Regular employees hours fluctuate a lot, so it can be a bit unpredictable what hours you work. Great part-time job though."
good,"The on-the-job training was thorough and comprehensive.  The company loves to promote from within, and encourages workers to apply for jobs at other stores in the company."
good,"Management is very helpful and willing to see employees advance up the chain. Customers by and large are awesome (but as with all customer service jobs, there are some sour grapes no matter how you treat them), especially our regulars, who are devoted to us. Membership numbers are the #1 factor determining your hours each week. Every single co-worker is a blast to work with."
good,I enjoyed a great career with Barnes and Noble for twenty years. It was very rewarding and the team members continuously showed their support in all initiatives.
good,I enjoyed this job as this place of business was one that I frequented a lot as a customer. I learned to prepare drinks as a barista and enhanced my knowledge in various genres of books.
good,"Unlike other jobs, barns and noble is one that you'll actually like to come into every day. The job training is easy and everyone is more then happy to help you with any problem or question you have. Coworkers are easy to work with as well and management is extremely supportive. There are tons of things to do, so you'll never get bored and there is tons of friendly competition with sales."
good,"A typical day at work could consist of working at the cash register, helping a customer find a book, answering the phone at the information desk, shelving books and finding room on the shelves for new titles, organizing displays, or taking down books that are no longer listed. This is one of the more enjoyable jobs I've had. I've learned about front-listing and back-listing titles, selling trends, how to sell memberships and make effective sales that are good for the customer and good for the company, and I've learned how to organize merchandise so that it sells more effectively. My co-workers are all passionate about books and most genuinely love their jobs - for many, it's their ""fun"" job. The hardest part of my job is that the store I work at is so enormous, it's hard to keep track of everything. However, searching for books and getting to run all over the store to find titles to put on display is also one of the joys of my job.  As a writer, I have always, and will always have, a passion for books."
good,"Excellent place to work if you enjoy customer service. I learned a lot about time management and how to keep several customers happy at once. Management was always fantastic to the workers, and even brought food for everyone a few times. The days fly by, it seems after each group of customers you assist, another hour is gone. Breaks are paid, and hours are very consistently good. I would recommend working here to anyone."
good,"I typically clock in and help customers right away. I'll be around the customer service desk for about 2 hours and by that point in the evening it's getting a little later so I can begin the key part of my job as a closer, which is cleaning the store. My coworkers and I go throughout the entire store and clean what needs to be, recovering the bookshelves and putting away strays that customers left while maintaining helping customers and answering the phones."
good,Barns and Noble provided an ideal work environment while attending the University which hosted the store. The managers were more than  willing to comply with my school schedule.
good,"Awesome people, awesome vibe. "
good,"Greeting and assisting customers in finding books or serving them in the cafe. Setting up and taking down required displays and signage."
good,"Work is fast paced but always manageable, my coworkers are fun and friendly, managers are understanding and flexible. They really care about their workers and everyday is rewarding."
good,I loved all of my coworkers and the managers were very helpful. it is so sad the store closed. It was a very happy spirited environment.
good,"I love that I actually have a job where I like to come to work. Everyone is very like-minded, so it makes for a very laid-back environment. This company values its employees as intelligent individuals. I know I'm a really good match for this company because I can't really think of anything I don't like."
good,co-worker made this job enjoyable; customer were the best; Staff was most group educated individuals I ever met.
good,"My time with Barnes and Noble Booksellers has been one I will not soon forget.  Over the years, I have fallen in love with the product I sell, the customers I cater to, and the people I work with.  My Typical day is almost always filled with something to do.  In my book, there is no such thing as downtime.  In working for this company I have turned into a hardworking and organized individual; it has taught me that effective personal and interpersonal communication is the key to an effective work environment. By working in various position, I have needed to become proficient in various office applications, and my time at Barnes and Noble has taught me how to deliver quality service by using empathy, teamwork, responsibility, integrity, respect, and quality. Working as the deputy community relations and business development liaison, I have learned how to network and maintain outside relationships with important clients; with the various supervisor and lead positions I have worked within the company I have learned how to effectively time manage, assign tasks, and manage people to the best of everyone’s abilities.  I also have developed proficient knowledge of office applications such as Word, Outlook, Publisher and a working knowledge of Excel.  My management team is a unique, driven, and diverse set of individuals who genuinely care about their employees.  My co-workers are honestly some of the best people I will ever hope to meet.  Each one has a special place in their heart for what we do as a company and the service we deliver.  The hardest and most enjoyable part of my job"
good,"Working for Barnes & Noble I felt like there were always opportunities to move up and do well in your area. They care about their employees well-being. They do their best to put forth a clean, safe, comfortable work environment."
good,"Though times/trends in retail are changing, it was a wonderful opportunity to learn new skills and help a dept/company succeed."
good,"Oversee activities directly related to sales or providing services."
good,"Work was like a kid in a sand box you never knew who you would meet. I learned that organizing can often consist of many different catogories and that selling school books can cause you to have a massive headache. Management was on top of her game at all times she always knew what was happening in the store, she always notified everyone of their shifts or changes ahead of time and she took time out to actually get to know her employees. My co-works were sociable at times but other than that we all kept busy. The hardest part of the job was rush week. Iv never seen so many students buy and and return books all at one time it was some what nerve wrecking but managible. Meeting new people everyday and laughin about their class stories or class projects gone wrong was joy for me."
good,"My day starts off as checking the delivery load for the day.After that is done then I can focus on  how many co-workers I need in receiving for that days shipment. I learned a lot with the years as a receiving manager. As far as the Management Team what ever were needed down in receiving I were given."
good,"I have been trained at CashWrap and it has been a great learning experience.  I am able to work with people and help meet their needs, whether it be them purchasing items or returning one.  I have been working mornings, so I usually work by myself and I have a list of duties that I work on during my shift.  I stock/restock items which helps me learn the merchandise we sell up front.  "
good,"Bustling as a barista keeps you on your toes and always busy. It was a great way to learn about the customers, their preferences and things (like drinks, foods and programs that may or may not have worked) directly from the customers."
good,When arriving the managers let you know which area you will be working for your shift. The managers make sure the shifts switch smoothly and everyone gets a well amount of hours.
good,"A typical day would include direct interaction with customers helping them select items based on their preferences as well as locating items they ask for. Booksellers also aid customers in placing orders as well as locating and pulling those same orders. Also, you will interact with customers via telephone for the same duties. There is some stocking and shelf straightening involved, also booksellers may be asked to work some as a cashier in the music department, the cafe, or the main checkout. Management was great, understanding and hardworking individuals ready and willing to answer your questions and help you out."
good,"This company is great to work with with few downfalls. The environment is often upbeat and if you like books than you will always be interested in your work, like I was. It is easy to train yourself in whatever section and try to become the expert or lead in that area, but the bad part about this company is that they are terrible with training and following up with training. It makes promotion or advancement very difficult."
good,"Up beat."
good,"Love the people and the life of the staff. You will never not be busy. I learned much about coffee, the management is wonderful no complaints minus the pay rate for all that you do."
good,"My first job and honestly one of the best I've ever had. Great discounts on merchandise, understanding management, fun coworkers. Also the values that the company itself has and holds too are great. The hardest part of the job is finding merchandise. Many times I had to go into the backroom to locate items for customers. The most enjoyable part is working with customers especially if you are a book lover. Management is very understanding of personal needs and are willing to negotiate a viable work schedule that will benefit both parties. A typical day is spent working with customers, location items, and keeping the store organized and presentable as well as restocking shelves and table and setting up or moving displays."
good,You will always be busy and entertained at work with a great variety of overflow tasks. Very enjoyable atmosphere.
good,"Great place to work. Everyone is nice, nice break room, nice bosses,  great discounts"
good,"Relaxed and productive work with fun people. "
good,"I absolutely loved this job. If I hadn't had to move to a different state, I would probably still be working there. There were tons of new things for me to learn that I had never had experience in. I learned how to make coffee drinks which is a skill all in its own, I was able to work in the book section and help customers find books they were searching for, and I was able to meet new customers that eventually became familiar to me and I to them. Although it was only part-time, the business worked with me as much as they could to get me hours and help me learn in more than one area of the store. Almost every single one of the employees were pleasant to be around and loved their jobs which made them much easier to work with and for."
good,Great place to work. Love being around books all managers extremely helpful and friendly. Never a bad day.
good,I enjoyed this position and it's variety of workers and content.
good,"I really liked my job of working and managing the cafe. I liked the way my job allowed me to meet and interact with different people on a day to day basis. I had originally wanted to start working there because the company at the time I as looking was a very fast forward company with it's handling of domestic partners, in relation to the benefits they offered."
good,"What I enjoyed most about this job was the books. I'm a big reader and a writer and I just love being surrounded with books and when I began working at Barnes and Noble I was aready familiar with alot of the authors and books and I was able to give my opinion to the customers and employees and all the employees had to learn the cafe located inside the store and it was alot of fun to learn how to make the frappachino's,cappachinos and latte's. I became fast friends with the store managers and co-workers and they all patiently taught me everything they knew about the business and I looked forward to coming to work.everyday was a new experience for me.I learned the register pretty fast and I was able to get to know the regulars and I became part of a family. I was heart broken when the store had to close for business."
good,"On most days at Barnes N Noble I would greet and assist customers with purchases. I would constantly be sweeping the floor for shrink and giving great customer service. I furthered my experience in customer service and improved my up sale tactics. The management here was very professional but also very relaxed, the managers really made the job fun. All my coworkers here were responsible employees and I have nothing but good things to say about them. The hardest part of this job was getting people to purchase a Barnes N Noble membership. The thing I enjoyed the most about the job was the customer interaction and trying to give them the best customer experience possible."
good,"Customer service is number one at Barnes & Noble, as a bookseller you help the individual with what they need and then move to the next customer. The customers are patient because to know they will receive the same service. There are no slackers at the Claire Lane Center store, everyone works at stocking and re-shelving books, and helping each other help the customers, we are a good team. The managers are informative, considerate and work along side the booksellers. I learned more about eBooks. The hardest part is when it is slow and all the work is done, I like to stay busy. A down side is not being able to buy all the books I would like to read, however we can check books out.  The best part is working with people and helping people that have a love of books and reading. I get paid for doing what I already do with friends, family and acquaintances, talk about and recommend books. "
good,"i loved working here, my favorite of every job i have ever had, the pay was ok, but the environment was awesome, they like to hire book readers and they really use your strengths, for example i read more of the y/a fiction and fantasy, they were very happy to have me there because they didn't have anyone specializing in either of those genres. there fore any questions customers would have in those genres they would point to me, we had meetings often were we could discuss the books we were ready and it really created a good environment and encouraged us all to be friends. if there was a barnes and noble were i live now i would want to work there again."
good,"Its pretty much a laid back job, this is the EASIEST cashiering job I have ever had, the managers are fun, as well as the supervisors, co workers are easy to get along with."
good,"As the community relations manager, I support the store manager by providing back up management when needed. I motivate staff through contests and incentive programs designed to improve sales and job performance. My position requires me to develop and maintain client relations and accounts while establishing customer loyalty and trust."
good,"it is minimumm wage but the managers are understanding, flexible with your schedule."
good,This is one of my favorite jobs I have ever had. The management is helpful and supportive. They tell you exactly what needs to be done without being patronizing. My coworkers are also helpful and the overall environment is welcoming.
good,"This is a great place to work! Benefits for part time employment after a year of working for the company. The store I worked for had great management, and I loved the people I worked with. Stayed with them for 4 1/2 years."
good,"At Barnes & Noble I am responsible for providing quality"
good,"Great place to work with great people! The normal duties of a bookseller consist of helping customers find books that they are looking for, or ordering them online, putting up re-shop, helping move product on tables with sets, and re-arranging books on tables and shelves to make it look better."
good,"Overall, this place was a wonderful place to work. The management is wonderful and they truly care about their employees. I learned so much working for this company."
good,"I love this job because the people I work with are great and supportive. Mostly a part time job but I love the discount! When you buy as many books as I do, it's a must."
good,"Amazing coworkers and managers! Super fun and upbeat Energy! Being a cashier is the best because, most likely, the customers are happy because they found something they wanted in the store."
good,"If you love books and people, this is a great and easy place to work. It’s not too busy, but it’s not boring either. One of my favorite jobs ever as far as job culture and coworkers. Doesn’t pay a ton, (at least for regular booksellers) but it’s a great job for students and people looking for part time work"
good,"I've been at Barnes and Noble for over a year now, which is long enough to know that I love it! The management is awesome and very understanding, while also doing a great job at directing and guiding us through the day. While not every guest is kind and the pay is about what you would expect from a retail job in the Mid-west; I can always count on my co-workers to truly be on my team."
good,"I like working here, it was a good experience for me. I learned how to be responsible and how the business life is. "
good,"Management was always considerate about my mental health which is rare when you work in any minimum wage job. Not too strict on dress code, I had tattoos/piercings/colored hair. Hours varies through year but great hours during holiday season."
good,Barnes and Noble is a quirky but fun place to work. Ideal for a book nut as everyone loves reading there. It is relaxed and the customer is number on.
good,"As retail goes, you can’t do better than Barnes & Noble. You serve a different demographic ( people who actually enjoy reading and broadening their knowledge), the environment is wonderful (coffee and books - best of both worlds), and great coworkers and managers. The manager and assistant managers are wonderful. They work right alongside the booksellers and considerate. Employees are intelligent and knowledgeable, and the environment is uplifting. Great retail experience."
good,working here was great !! you have to be very patient with customers but other than that it is a very chill job.the only thing is that there isnt alot of variety in ethnicities.
good,Both my bosses were really nice. I would mostly just work the register and the customer service desk helping people find the items that they were looking for.
good,"I love working here! There are amazing people and it is super fun to work there! Like any jobs there is some negatives like how many hours your working, but overall it has been one of my favorite work experiences."
good,"Great for seasonal job and nice people. Easy to learn and use equipment. Awesome discounts. Fast paced at times, then slow throughout day. Word of warning you will deal with a lot of customers, some of which will be nice and others not so much."
good,It was the job I'd been looking for.  Unfortunately the economy back then required me to seek a higher paying position with a different career background (computers) instead of my desire (books)
good,"a typical day would be spent making drinks for regulars. Co-workers are fun and easy going. Management is very nice and understanding. The fast-paced environment is sometimes stressful but you get breaks to relax, drink coffee, and look at books."
good,"Its your typical retail place, but what really made it was the fact that the managers and other booksellers were all very wonderful people. I would highly recommend this job."
good,"Working at Barnes & Noble was overall a very fun and rewarding job.  The work environment was amazing and my coworkers were terrific.  As the years went by and the company faced a financial crisis, it became unrealistic to meet sales goals.  Company downsizing also eliminated many full-time positions."
good,The people at Barnes and Noble were the best part. We were like a little community. The job was very easy and fast-paced. The management was excellent. I have no complaints there. I would recommend working here to anyone.
good,"Working at Barnes and Noble was a great experience. As a student at Southern Miss, I was able to receive deals on textbooks as an employee and fully understand the job."
good,The people are great to work with and the job itself is a lot of fun! The accommodate school schedules which is always nice and they are always willing to work around your schedule in general. Would recommend to anyone who’s always wanted to work in a bookstore!
good,"The associates are new and interesting and unique, and every single day is different. My favorite part is the employees I work with, and the work I do."
good,Great temporary or part time job and their manager training was pretty solid. Plenty of different tasks and jobs to do in the store and everyone was great to work with
good,"As a part-time bookseller at Barnes and Noble Bookseller, I loved my job.  I would at the cash register frequently which I enjoyed greatly, as well as in various parts of the store reorganizing and restocking.  I especially enjoyed working in the Children's Book Area and helping parents find books for their children.  A great deal of time was spent reshelving and straightening books which I found satisfying as I am a very neat person by nature."
good,"Working at Barnes & Nobles was honestly one of the best decisions I've ever made. My coworkers and managers were extremely friendly and helpful. There is a lot to do in the store to maintain it, but all responsibilities are shared evenly and we are encouraged to cooperate and work together to tackle problems. Managers often listened to requests, such as wanting to work on the floor instead of the registers, and tried to assign workers to places they seemed to do the best in. There is a heavy emphasis on customer service at Barnes & Noble, which is a really nice feeling. Instead of being more focused on the product, which many retail places fall prey to, Barnes & Noble insists that the customers come first. It was more important to greet and help customers than anything else. The managers even had a ""place the book in their hand"" policy, which essentially meant that if a customer approaches you, you don't leave them alone until you've helped them to the best of the store's collective ability. Pretty much everything about working here was wonderful, from the people to the workplace itself. The most challenging things to deal with are Fridays, Saturdays, and holidays. Fridays and Saturdays are always very busy, which means there's little time to complete any tasks that need to be done. Holidays are always even busier, but the store usually schedules extra employees to compensate, so it's never too much to handle."
good,All around fun and rewarding job. Terrific staff to work with and excellent management team. My only experience with retail and I believe I started at the top!
good,Stores might be closing down so you have to be prepared for that. Not great a preventing media theft. Not much time for managers to see district managers or regional managers
good,"Productive and fun place to work with down to earth, intelligent and fun loving people.My supervisor was the best. He made sure you were trained properly and told you not to sweat the unimportant stuff."
good,"I always enjoyed going into work. Over all, it is a pretty quiet atmosphere with the occasional riveting conversation between a customer and an employee about the latest book release. I learned a lot about how to care for customers and balance a lot of different tasks at once. The management team is always training and preparing employees to move up in their status with the company. That is perhaps both the most difficult and most rewarding part of the job."
good,I liked the work environment and how they always had something to do. Game days were the busiest and the managers were very understandable about having class time and study time before coming into work.
good,"Overall the company is one of the best to work for. It can have it's challenging moments but it's also what makes it exciting. You build personal and professional relationships that stay with you throughout your tenure with the company. It's a fun and inviting atmosphere working with students, staff and Professors."
good,"I worked for Barnes & Noble for 6.5 years. I started part-time while I was in college and the management team was very accommodating. I was then promoted twice and worked in the sales & inventory management role for 4.5 years. During that time, I gained knowledge of the industry, learned countless skills, and made a lot of friends. There is always something to keep you busy, and always someone nearby to help with questions you may have. There were countless opportunities to learn something new, and the entire staff that I worked with was dedicated, knowledgeable and fun to be around."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job at Barnes and Noble was definitely the people there that I was able to work with. Everyone was very nice and easy to get along with.
good,"great place to work with real great people, espically if you are a book loving person. the only downside is that the job just doesn't pay a whole lot."
good,"A typical day was relaxed. Holidays and back to school days were quick paced. The hardest part was locating a book when the customer has no idea what they're looking for, but it a great feeling when you manage it anyway through deductive reason."
good,"I had the honor of working at the Barnes & Noble store in Fort Lauderdale. The management was simply brilliant. I've worked in a lot of places over the past 35-years. Nowhere have I dealt with a more proactive, responsive and committed team of managers. Of course, everyone would like more hours, but they tell us going in not to expect that, and there are opportunities to advance. Bottom line: if everyone is doing their job everyone's job is that much easier. I was amazed at the extent to which everyone, from the top down, consistently pulled their oars in the same direction. The feeling of putting a book into a customer's hands is something special. Folks who work there take pride in their store, and that makes the menial tasks that much easier to tend. It's a great place to work, especially if you have a love for words."
good,I loved working at Barnes. The atmosphere is amazing and the people are too. As long as you are a book lover than working here is a dream. There are projects and deadlines and rude customers but management understands that the customers need to be helped. Displays will be done when there is time to complete them. Barnes and Noble recognizes their employees accomplishments and announces them through inter store communications.
good,"Very basic knowledge. You just have to be a cashier or have great customer service skills. They don't expect a lot of you, just run the store like a trained employee."
good,"It was always fun to go into work and be greeted by the work family. The other Baristas were amazing and the assistant store manager at the time was absolutely phenomenal! The only part of the job that was difficult would have been the rushes, but once you get good enough at the job it's not so bad."
good,"Barnes & Noble was a pretty standard college job, especially as a cashier. Nothing too fancy but it worked for the time being. I had nice mangers and flexible hours. Not a great job culture but it wasn't negative either."
good,"I've worked at Barnes and Noble little over a year but I would not quit unless I absolutely had to. The people I work with are all amazingly intelligent and kind individuals, all with a unique personality. This is the first job I've worked where I haven't experienced any drama because the people I work with recognize that bickering will not help us grow as a team. Management is on point and cares deeply for their employees and though there is the typical corporate touch that brings a little annoyance to the job, overall it is a wonderful place to work. The only downside to the job is that the pay is not great and I won't blame the company for that. Unfortunately book stores are struggling to survive in the onslaught of online retail. Even then I have received more pay raises unprompted than at a retail establishment I worked at for 4+ years that is thriving. They care about their employees and their happiness. The job itself is not terribly exciting but if you love books and talking to people that are passionate about reading, you'll fit right in."
good,I loved working at this store. The management team is awesome and so our the other employees. Everyone helps each other out and offers help all the time.
good,"Like with most any job you can find something to complain about, sure, with this job it's no different. That being said, if you're complaining you are either lazy or insecure. The managers are fair and helpful, showing real care for their employers as well as their customers. Customers are diverse, you'll find overly enjoyable regulars and randoms as well as the occasional nightmare. I highly enjoyed my time here and sure you CAN as well."
good,"Usually pretty easy going shifts and easy work. Management places a big emphasis on customer service and personal selling. In addition, over the last couple of months there has a big shift in combining the two sides (restaurant and selling floor) into one."
good,"The place is fun to work at and easy going. the hours are flexible and the people are kind. its an all-around exciting places to work, if i had the chance i would return."
good,"Co-workers were all nice while making the work environment a pleasant place to go to work. The jobs were well organized. The most enjoyable part was reaping the discount benefits. I was lucky and had two great bosses, I always wanted to do a good job and made me feel that my work is helpful to the company."
good,"it is and incredible place to work with incredible people, and usually great music. my coworkers are funny, smart, and kind to every customer. i really like the customers that come into the store, its one of my favorite things about working there."
good,"Barnes and Noble provided a great place to work. The company discounts are generous. This aside, it is evident that a few people in management haven't from time to time offered any empathy in regards to the responsibilities and workload of their employees."
good,The typical day was very welcoming. Everyone was friendly and sociable. My manager was very agreeable and made it to where our hours and days were very flexible.
good,"It was a great work environment, friendly staff, and a great place to work. Great management to work with and great discounts. Ability to interact with customers and coworkers."
good,It was my first job and I couldn't have asked for anything better! If you put in all your efforts then this is a great place to work. There are membership quotas but being polite and friendly to every customer works that out. Managers were very helpful and awesome.
good,On a daily basis I assist customers with locating books and informing customers about our fantastic membership program. Working for B&N is a terrific opportunity and I take great pride in helping the public purchase books and other items that we carry.
good,This job was very good being that I was in college while working. This will be a great job for a college student who does not participate in any extracurricular activities.
good,the managers at the Kitchen are absolutely amazing and provide a very welcoming and constructive environment. The culture of the entire store is amazing because most of the people who work here are book nerds so we all like to have a great time at work.
good,"I have very much enjoyed working with my employers at Barnes and Noble. The management team is wonderful. They were willing to shift my constantly changing schedule during school, and in return I would pick up shifts as much as possible when ever they would call needed extra help. The hardest part of the job for me at the moment is when people ask for titles that I am reading, or would recommend. Since I have only been reading text books, I can only suggest what is popular at the moment, not my personal favorite. Enjoyable parts would definitely be learning what people are reading and have enjoyed. Some would tell me to suggest titles to customers, and when I do, they come back saying they loved the book. A typical day in a bookstore would be (for me since I usually open) get there at 7am. Shelf which ever carts are full from the back until our shift meeting at 8:45am. At 9:00am the doors open. I would usually stay around customer service and help incoming customers find titles to read."
good,"A typical day at work consists of clocking in, helping customers find books and working the register.  The main focus of a bookseller is selling as many memberships as possible.  While there is pressure to do so, if you are not a skilled sales person there are a few other tasks to be completed.  The management communicates effectively and the work environment is very relaxed, as everyone gets along very well."
good,Everyone at the store was nice and they were flexible with the schedules. I liked working there and the employee discount was good. They  have the cafe workers and book staff completely obsolete from each other.
good,A day would be okay. Your local regulars and orders. I learned how to maintain a healthy and safe environment and how to keep stock.Everyone was friendly.
good,This company is amazing to work for. You get an amazing discount and you get to keep water with you at the registers. There are always fun activities going on at Barnes and Nobleb and there are always room to move up in the company. The management are always understanding and they certainly help you whenever you need help without complaining.
good,"Perfect job for book lovers, although it is NOT a job where you can stand around reading when it's slow.  A typical day involves helping customers, merchandising, shelving books, and completing various projects set by the company.  The culture is generally a very friendly one, with the majority of employees loving the environment, which means turnover is fairly low.  "
good,"if you want to make a differnce in a persons life, while only being a sales associate, then barnes and noble is the place to work. BN trusts their employees and appreciates them."
good,Already stated in previous review for Barnes and Noble. This job was great and rewarding because of summer events for children and storytime. The staff was welcoming and fun and I learned a great deal from every aspect at this job.
good,"Who doesn't like people that like books. Everyone that worked there was very, very pleasant. Also, no one is ever mad who comes into the store so everything is great."
good,"I loved working at Barnes and Noble.  I would still be working there but the store in my community was closed.  I learned a great deal about brick and mortar book stores, new authors and music.  It's a great place to work if you love books, music and movies."
good,"By learning what makes each department unique and learning how to maintain every department; the store is by far ""salesready."" The department heads train you to understand what goes on minute by minute on any typical workday."
good,"A typical day at work generally involves a lot of customer service and clean up duties, i.e. shelving books and clearing the cafe area. More often than not, the coworkers have been amazing, and it's always a fun, active environment to be in. The hardest part of the job is helping so many people, but it is also the most enjoyable. You have the opportunity to meet a lot of truly amazing people in the process."
good,"Working at this bookstore was a great experience. Being surrounded by books and the scent of freshly brewed coffee made every shift a breeze to get through. Management was very supportive, understanding, and appreciative of the employees. Co-workers were fun and helpful."
good,Great place to work. On the job training. Flexible hours. Management is friendly and helpful. Wonderful culture that puts their employees first.
good,"Like any retail work, the hardest part of the job is the customers. This job has taught me to be more aware of how I treat all people. The most enjoyable part of the job is being surrounded by so many books."
good,"A nice work environment. There is always something to do. Lots of customers to interact with and give recommendations on goods and services. As a graduate student, I work here"
good,"The over all environment of Barnes & Noble is as enjoyable as if you yourself were shopping. The atmosphere and complexion of the management is pleasant and enjoyable as they are about daily coaching in the moment. The workplace learning experience is non-stressful due to this environment. It is non-intimidating because it is expected. This makes the booksellers approachable.Cross training creates an attitude of importance to the booksellers as well. It is most helpful for our MOD's to share when and whatever they may know."
good,Overall I think it was fun experience being a part of this company. They have high standards but overall need to learn where to draw the line on bending to much in regards to customer service. The customer is always right but to a degree.
good,"jobs was fun exciting and upbeat "
good,"I open the store and then interact with customers all day I order food and supplies for the store. I am the sole employee at my location. Once my shift is over I close the registers, count the safe, and close down the store."
good,"I loved having a set checklist to go through every morning. My responsibilities ranged from making sure online orders were processed to making sure the textbooks we needed for the semester were up to date on our website. However, the most difficult task I faced as a store supervisor was making sure the employees and the customers were working with each other instead of against each other. I had to learn when to step in when a customer was getting testy or when an employee was falling shy of presenting accurate information to customers."
good,"A typical day at work included coming in to customer services, greeting and assisting customers, answering the phone, doing searches on the server to check product availability, and friendly conversation with customers as well as sales. I learned a way to effectively interact with customers as well as basic cash register and telephone skills. The management at the Lincolnshire location was incredibly friendly and helpful. They were personable and made sure to get to know each and every one of their staff and was always there to help when I had questions, or needed help managing the book floor. My coworkers were some of the nicest people I'd met, just as friendly and relateable as the managers. They were always willing to help me when I was getting acclimated to the work place, and were very efficient in what they did. The hardest part of the job was getting used to the layout, as there are so many books and chnageovers that take place throughout the year."
good,"Barnes and Noble was a wonderful place for a guy like me. Where else could I show up and talk about books all day long? After I left Barnes and Noble, I went on to get a degree in English, again, talking about and reading books like it was my job. A typical day at work would flow with the seasons; ie, Christmas was very busy, but in the summertime, things slowed down. I learned a lot about people managing and sales. My co workers were excellent; all different types, all sharing a love of books, storytelling, and helping people find something to expand their worldviews by even just a little bit or a lot. The hardest part was the hours, I just couldn't find time in my schedule to work more. The most enjoyable part of the job was the every day interactions with customers and helping them find what they were looking for; something for them, a gift, something for school, etc. Our job was 'sales' but for us, it was more about making a connection with the people who would come in, looking for something that piqued their curiosity."
good,"If it was not for the price reduction on other competitors, this company had a good potential. Unfortunately cost was / is a factor"
good,"Fine atmosphere and working conditions."
good,Is very productive and the co-workers are very nice to each others and the manager is well educated. I learn how to operate all the industrial machines.
good,"Commitment to excellent customer service is what makes B&N a great place to work.  The hardest part of the job is also the most enjoyable part of the job -- it takes a lot of effort to create & maintain the kind of environment that customers have come to expect of B&N.  However, it is worth it when you personally feel you have contributed to the customers' positive experience."
good,I recently just started working at Barnes & Nobles Café and I actually really enjoy my co workers are fun and supportive to work with of course you will have to learned all the drinks and to make them and within 4 days I was able to use the cash register and make the drinks. It really showed how much I learn things quickly through those challenges and mistakes. I enjoy meeting you people and trying new things.
good,Loved book selling and planning book release parties as well as author signings.  The job had enough variety to keep workers interested and engaged.  My favorite part of the job was finding the right book for the right customer and having them return to the store to tell me they loved reading my recommended book.
good,"worked on various product and love to work with them, team lead was very helpful and cooperative. wish they have the permanent position"
good,"While management changes can be hard for some, the overall experience is worth it.  No two days are ever the same and that keeps it fun.  Having a love of books is a huge plus.  Coworkers at every store I have been in have always felt like family."
good,"I loved working for the Barnes & Noble College, LLC at my community college. I was able to engage in friendly conversation with my coworkers and managers, and it was an enjoyable time all around. We had a semi-steady flow of customers who were always willing to communicate with us, so we could help them find what they needed. The best part about working here was learning new experiences."
good,"The managers, coworkers, and customers are interesting to talk to and work with, which creates a positive environment overall. Each shift is structured to maximize productivity in all areas of the store including breaks. The schedules are flexible to work with outside needs like education. Managers are excellent with maintaining all tasked responsibilities with any variables that arise."
good,"Working at Barnes and Noble a typical day at work i help customers and the other staff get the store closed for the night, and help with any projects the store has going on"
good,As a full time student finding a job that is doesn't increase your stress and offers flexibility can be very difficult.  Barnes & Nobles on campus was able to offer just this as well as the ability to advance withing the company should you so choose.
good,"The pay is minimum wage, as with many major corporations, but the work environment is phenomenal.  Both my coworkers and my supervisors are excellent people: very respectful and caring.  I work primarily as a cashier, but provide a great deal of customer service and am being cross-trained in the café as well.  I was named Employee of the Month and received the District ""Above & Beyond"" Award, which recognizes booksellers for excellence in delivering extraordinary customer service, team spirit, going the extra mile, increasing business knowledge and personal growth."
good,"Fast paced work environment with great opportunity to learn and develop soft skills such as time management, leadership and communication skills."
good,"The work and assignments given are very much strict to finish in working hrs."
good,"just a great place to work. can brush up on your reading !"
good,"Fantastic place to work if your a loyal and hard worker."
good,"Opening store, counting tills and setting goals for the day for each employee. Management is friendly and employees are the heart of the business. Customers are by far the greatest part of the day."
good,"I work in both the cafe and on the book floor at my location and I love it! My managers are some of my favorite people to interact with and every day is a little bit different. The hardest part of the job is just dealing with difficult customers and vague requests, but the rewarding part is seeing customers enjoy the products feels great. There is a huge sense of camaraderie amongst my coworkers and I love it."
good,"I loved working at Barnes and Noble. The Managers were great as well as the sales associates. I was able to move up in the company and become doubled trained in the Cafe and on the book floor, working in the Music department as well. My Co-workers made my day and we still keep in touch till this day."
good,"*Excellent work environment"
good,"Great place to work with incredible benefits, along with a management team that wanted employees to succeed and grow within the company and helped employees to attain those goals."
good,Working for this company is very nice. There are no complaints about this company other the pay is very poor
good,Really enjoyed my time there management was great along with all the people I worked with.  The pay isn't all that great but you usually have the chance to pick up some extra hours in other positions.
good,My most enjoyable part of the job is communicating with customers.
good,"This was a part time job for me while I was in school. I rang people out, and helped students find their books for the classes that they were scheduled for."
good,I was a management trainee.  I worked in the cafe and the book store.  I worked days and evening shifts so it was hard to balance my personal life with my work day.
good,"A typical day at work was never the same.  There were countless jobs to be accomplished from placing new incoming books on the proper shelves to dusting the shelves to helping customer find a particular book or other similar books or ordering a book that we did not have or telling them about our NOOK and how wonderful it is or working at the cash registers cashing out customers and even gift-wrapping for a holiday if they requested it (free) and the lunch breaks that were also good because of the proximity to healthy foods in various restaurants in the mall and getting 30% off any of our employee purchases and enjoying all the other employees because  we all have similar goals and attributes of being avid readers or bibliophiles and thinkers…..on and on I could go about the benefits"
good,Barnes and Noble was great. Each and every boss I had was great and cared about their employees. My supervisors were very helpful and worked with my school schedule. They also trained me and helped me get to the next level.
good,Job at the bookstore is required multitasking skills. I have been working over there during my graduate school. It is a very good start in your path career.
good,"I didn't know as much about Barnes and Noble until I started working in Barnes and Noble's Cafe.  For me a typical day at work is customer service, working with co-workers and managers, doing small and big tasks as well as providing great service.  I have learned a lot about cafe drinks as well as what Barnes and Noble provides for there customers, employees and employers.  If I wasn't an employee and, knew what I know now as a customer, I would buy into membership with Barnes and Noble and be there as much as possible, providing my finances.  Out of all places I have worked, Barnes and Noble has the best management, co-workers and policies.  I wanted 5 stars for Compensation and Benefits but, once I put 3 it would not allow me to change.  Everybody works together to provide the best customer service.  The hardest part of the job is when you first start working and you don't know much about cafe skills or the drinks and how they are made and, you learn how to make it.  The most enjoyable part about the job is the environment and, that I know I am part of a team who has a lot to offer to Barnes and Noble's customers."
good,"I've been with this company for 10 years and it has been a wonderful and fast paced 10 years. However, I feel that I have out grown and learned all there is to know about this business and am looking to take on a new challenge."
good,I worked in the Cafe in the bookstore in Tyler and it was one of the best times I could have! If given a chance I would go back to work for this company again!
good,"Everyday is enjoyable, the entire staff is wonderfully accepting.  The hardest part of the job is deciding the best part. "
good,"All my managers are competent, and fair, but also fun to be around. The hardest part of the job for me is also the most enjoyable part of the job, which is dealing with the customers. I enjoy helping the customers find the books that they want/need, because I enjoy and encourage reading."
good,"Having a small amount of income was helpful during college. Being said, this store was perfect for that. The job was located on campus, simple to learn and even easier to do. My boss was easy-going and understanding with scheduling. The only con was low hours for working. "
good,"Barnes & Noble treats their employees well and the benefits and good.  You get vacation, health insurance, personal days, and sick days. "
good,"The hours can be long sometimes, but there is always something that needs to be done which helps to keep me busy. Working here has helped me with my time-management skills as well as learning to enjoy a variety of customers."
good,"I've been with this company for over 2 years, and still love it. Management makes all the difference to me, and while not all stores will have such a wonderful team of managers like mine, the company itself is great. Full time employees get affordable health care, and what I consider to be a good deal of vacation. They've changed the policy on it since I've been there, so I'm not exactly sure what it is as far as vacation, but being a full time employee since April, in February I had 80 hours vacation, 16 personal and 36 sick time, if that gives you an idea. Part timers will also get vacation after 1000 hours of working (apx a year, depending)."
good,The best part about this job are the people who work here. Everyone shares a love of knowledge and literature. It's easy to get along with everyone because you inherently share a common interest.
good,"An enjoyable atmosphere where advancement is possible if you are willing to work hard and put yourself out there. Managers focus on constructive criticism. Co-workers are driven and keep store morale high. The most enjoyable part of the job is most certainly getting to work close to literature, and the discount."
good,"A typical day at Barnes and Noble includes helping customers find exactly what they are looking for when they themselves may not know exactly what that is. This is also includes ordering products we may not have in store, assistance with Nook devices, selling of the Barnes and Noble membership, Starbucks coffee, Godiva chocolate, toys, games, movies, music and of course books. This has helped my organizational skills vastly as well helped me become more of a leader. Barnes and Noble employs a select caliber of person who is knowledgeable of many areas of media and can communicate effectively to customers. The hardest part of the job is the ever shrinking demand of physical media due to the ever growing demand in downloadable media. I did enjoy the company's transition into the digital world with Nook devices, but it has decreased the opportunity for advancement (especially in such a small store such as mine). I enjoy helping customers immensely, but my favorite part of the job was merchandising displays."
good,Barnes and Noble is a fun business place to work at. It entails knowing book typesorts and what sorts are popular and what authors are good for certain interests.
good,"A typical retail job with a great discount. The people were fun, the managers were knowledgeable. I would work there again. As holiday staff, the primary concerns were to keep the till area clean, sell gift cards and keep the lines moving. It was easy and fun."
good,"I love my duties at Barnes and Noble. Who wouldn't like to ""talk"" books all day? A great job with fabulous customers and outstanding fellow employees."
good,"As I am a new part-time member of the bookselling team at Barnes & Noble, a typical day at work consists of reviewing the four core principles and the steps to quality customer service. Assignments and projects are completed while attending to customer needs. The shift is short and managers, consisting of verious professionals, tend to my training at all times while encouraging me as I learn many new things quickly. In this fast-paced environment it helps to have skilled, knowledgeable, attentive and experienced staff to help along the trainging. Taking on the initial brunt of the training was intimidating at first and when I came out selling more memberships on the first day then my goals were expected to be I knew I could relax and enjoy the rest of the training. I care about the integrity of my work and I add value as a bookseller/customer service/cashier/sales to book store, customers and team."
good,A typical day at work here would be managing he building as MOD. On a day to day basis you are responsible for all the store and employee needs. One thing I have learned from working at Barnes and Noble is how to be an effective manager. How to listen and and respond to many situations that occur everyday.
good,B&N is a fast paced environment with many complexities within a single building. The company has high expectations and provides you the resources to do your job at a high level. They believe and stand by their core values and understand the balance between work and personal time.
good,I discovered how much I love books working at Barnes and Noble. The children's department required a lot more patience and diligence than the rest of the store. I had wonderful management/co-workers so the store ran smoothly which in turn helped everyone love working there. The Nook e-reader is the one thing that pulled me away from company. As it grew the company started to pull the obscure books from their shelves and rely heavier on the popular front list books. Otherwise I have many wonderful memories working for this company.
good,always above standards untill last 3 months (I can further explain)
good,"Barnes and Noble is a great company to work for. The environment is challenging, there is always something new! Management is professional, compensation is good."
good,"i enjoyed it here. Sure this was my first job in retail, but the managers helped me enormously. I knew going into it that it would be only for the 2019 holiday season."
good,"I've worked for the company for a long time. Through ups and downs what's made me stay is the amazing culture of books, coffee and just overall learning! The people are what makes a company."
good,Even tho it was a seasonal Job being able to work there was great. I loved the environment and people. I would have stayed if the option was available.
good,"There aren't enough words to descibe how wonderful it was to work for Barnes and Noble."
good,One of the greatest things about Barnes and Noble was the community that evolved from the employees. Everyone there even with their differing opinions bonded like a family. And this was at various locations. I worked at three locations over my tenure at barnes and noble and every story was like another family.
good,"I absolutely enjoyed my time with Barnes & Noble, it was a very relaxed work pace with management that was ready to assist the employees in any way they could. Great attitudes all around and a patient management meant everyone was comfortable asking questions and being taught new skills and jobs."
good,I enjoyed working for B&N very much. A typical day would include anything from putting out and/or folding merchandise to spending an entire shift behind a register. I personally enjoyed a very busy day with customers.
good,It was a fun and fast pace environment to work in the people are great they were like family to me and still are. I worked in the café area and made coffee drinks from scratch. I enjoyed myself while I was there.
good,Many opportunities for advancement. Great benefits. Fun work environment. Excellent discounts. If you enjoy reading then selling books will  be an added benefit of the job.
good,"I did not work at the actual Barnes and Noble, I worked at the subsidiarity of Barnes and Noble through my college. It was a great and chill place to work. Everything was so easy and chilled. I would highly recommend anyone who wants to work there."
good,"The staff was always amazing and questions were always encouraged, Benefits for both full and part time employees were exceptional. A real open door policy, not just a sign on the wall. Great benefits and incredible staff."
good,"As a head cashier, I would spend nearly all my time on or near the cash wrap. I was responsible for most of the point of sale transactions, returns and exchanges, and membership programs sales. I pushed myself to excel in these things, and I was rewarded and affirmed for my successes in this area. I learned how to break down my sales goal, to make it achievable, and to exceed it. I learned how to inspire and encourage my fellow co-workers. We're a plethora of nerds working there, so there's a lot of overlap in interest and entertainment between employees. Our managers, for the most part, balanced well encouragement, affirmation, and holding our feet to the fire, pushing us to be better. The hardest part of the job was dealing with ornery and entitled customers, which is, I suppose, an occupational hazard. The most enjoyable parts of the job were the friendships I still have with former co-workers and managers, the lessons and diligence I learned in doing the same thing day in and day out, and the good books I was able to whole-heartedly recommend to my customers."
good,"Cashier, Bookkeeper, Returned books, Transferred phone calls, Pulled online orders, and I helped customers. It was a great fun filled learning experience."
good,"A typical day of work consisted of me helping customers and/or students find textbooks, seeing if students could use financial aid to purchase textbooks, and checking out merchandise. I learned how to use a cash register for merchandise and how to use the computer to find out if someone could use financial aid. The management was OK. One manager was really good, but the other one was kind of rude; the rude manager was sadly much ruder to the female employees than the male employees. The workplace culture was really good. employees tried to hard to make sure everyone enjoyed coming to work. The hardest part of the job was that it was temporary. The most enjoyable part of the job that it was above minimum wage."
good,"Loved the job, but due to me not having sick days, the days I called out with doctors notes weren't excused. I dealt with checking if the vendors had the books or other items in stock before even ordering them. And dealing with the actual book stores in helping them locate the item or informing them on any delays."
good,"I worked part-time and for a short while in only one department, so cannot comment on larger picture, but I liked working at this Barnes and Noble and would recommend it as a future job site."
good,"My job, especially at first, was fantastic! I really enjoyed my job when business was booming, but overtime, the started to become slower and slower. I don't know how busy it is nowadays, but at the time when I worked there, It was slow-paced. Despite that though, the people you meet while working there does make it worth while."
good,I like working at Barnes and Noble.  I have worked all positions.  It is a good place to work. Fast paced and customer focused.  Very competitive and structured.
good,"It's hard not to say a negative thing about working in a book store. No job is ever perfect but the environment at B&N always tries to be positive and fun. Management is easy to approach, communicate with and I feel like i'm being led by strong capable people."
good,"I loved working here. I was part-time, and the people i worked with and the management were all great people and extremely nice.  They were also accommodating to my schedule when i needed them to be, and happy to do so."
good,"its a great place to work if you like working alone, most of the time you will be alone in a position in the store at a time. the cool part is the schedule moves you around so you arent working in the same place too long (customer service, music department, cash register)"
good,It was one of the best places I've ever worked. The team and management always had a great attitude. Always promoted from within. The job was challenging and whenever anyone asked for more it was given. As well as help to those who needed it.
good,"I work in the cafe at a Barnes and Noble that is part of a huge mall. This means the traffic we get is heavy; but even on the slowest days, there is a lot of work to be done. You're always on the move."
good,"I worked for BN for 20 years and advanced from PT bookseller to Assistant Store Manager.  I have seen many transitions in the company but the devotion to providing coaching and leadership training is far beyond what most companies would invest.  The HR department is instrumental in keeping up to date with the newest HR processes/procedures and educating teams in leadership roles. While the Lencioni principles are useful in team building, I would suggest more of a balance with leveraging strengths that are identified in StrengthFinders 2.0 but other than that - It is a great company to work for."
good,"I was an English major, so being around the ones I loved was always enjoyable. I was there when the Harry Potters were being released, and it was SO much fun to talk HP with all of the kids. We had a Harry Potter club. The pay was bad because it was retail, but I have to hand it to B&N because I got a 25 cent raise every quarter. If you were doing your job, you got the raise. I liked that. "
good,"Everyone is always nice whether it is coworkers, management or the customers themselves. Always a great atmosphere and room to grow within the company."
good,"Game Stop is a part of Barnes & Noble. I had so much fun working there. It was always changing, new games, new systems, new accessories. It was a fun and exciting place to work even during Christmas."
good,"I have enjoyed working at Barnes & Noble for over 2+ years, and have made many friends from the coworkers I know.  Although not always busy, work gives me plenty to do in order to keep moving.  B&N provides a friendly atmosphere for all, and is always aiming to keep up with the latest in book and popular culture trends.  I've learned many skills from working different aspects of the job, and I would say the hardest part would be working on a new position when there's a lot of people in the store.  I enjoy seeing all the new titles that come out, as well as the people who get very excited when we find a book for them that they had been looking for."
good,"Working at Barnes and Noble in Reston then Fairfax VA, made me smile. But I have to say one in Fairfax was the best, being a lead in the kids department was the best. Seeing the kids eyes light up when they get a new book just makes you smile. Getting to work with all ages and discussing different books. "
good,"Barnes & Noble is a great company to work for. They offer flexible hours and management is great. A typical day includes handling customer service questions and completing projects, including setting up displays."
good,"I loved this fast paced work environment. It taught me how to stay on task, and satisfy the customers needs. I gained a lot of patience during this job, and I will carry this over into any other job I get."
good,The  management team at my store selects wonderful candidates who will contribute to the positive work team and customer service atmosphere to hire.
good,"Greeting customers upon arrival"
good,"Now its been 8 years since i worked here but i cam say that this was my all time favorite job! The work environment was fun and up beat, managers were amazing! My day went as follows, clock in a few minuets early and meet my coworkers to talk about what needed to be done that day. Fire up the registers unlocked the doors and helped customers find whatever book they were looking for. Simple right?! well not all of it but most of the work was easy to learn and once you had it down it was easy to become efficient at."
good,Fun and relaxed atmosphere!  Excellent employee benefits and management. If you love anything books this would be the place to be.
good,I enjoyed working at Barnes & Noble because they were able to work with my schedule being in the Delayed Entry Program for the Navy at the time and they offered great employee discounts as well as healthcare coverage if desired.
good,"A typical day at work for B&N if generally fast paced and productive. There is always something to do which makes the shifts fly by without ever having time to be bored. The customers you'll encounter will become almost like friends. The place is full of interesting people, and there are many interesting conversations to be had. I would say this that was the most enjoyable part of the time i spent with this company. The hardest part is the HOLIDAY SEASON! This place becomes an absolute MADHOUSE! HOWEVER, your coworkers and you will handle it well. trust me. you will love working here."
good,"I have been working at Nook Media full-time "
good,"I started Barnes and Noble when I was 16.  The place had a fantastic environment.  I was already a bookworm and to be among other people who loved the books was just amazing to me.  My co-workers were supportive and welcoming.  We are required to promote products and services such as books, Nooks, Member Card, etc.  We are able to support one another, give tips and suggestions, discuss what works and what doesn't."
good,"Its a family oriented company (but without the racism and hatred that normally entails). You really feel like you are part of a team trying to get projects through to completion. There is an excellent leadership team and plenty of mentoring opportunities. The company is conservative in structure so advancement is slower in certain departments, but you can advance through hard work and putting time in. Cannot recommend enough the culture at MTD!"
good,I've been working at Barnes and Noble for a year now and I love it. Some days can be stressful but at the end of the day knowing that you fulfilled a customers desire of a particular book is a great feeling.  I love all my managers even some that are no longer with the location. The hardest part of my job would have to be the the phone calls and trying to take care of a customer thats in the store at the same time.
good,"Wonderful people to work with and for! Customers are friendly and management and staff is supportive, helpful and positive. There is always opportunity to move up and learn new things."
good,"Overall a great place to work at, friendly people as well as co workers. Management is works well with the employees to work with the needs."
good,"•	Responsible for all daily operations of $750,000 café.  Managed crew of 15 including two lead supervisors.  "
good,I truly enjoyed working here. Never had strained or hectic day. Only time I didn't want to be at work was when I developed a flu. Managers were fair and willing to work with employees.
good,There were various new members in the store and Managers as well as Veteran Co-Workers assisted us all when we needed it. Managers were helpful and patient with us.

good,Great opportunities to grow and team build. Learned from a tried and trusted work model. Had the opportunity to work with immensely talented people.
good,"As with most places, your direct boss has a big influence on how well you like the job. I worked for great people at B&N my entire career there but I saw people I would never want to work for. Fortunately they aren't as common as the good ones. People are willing to help you develop new skills if that's what you want."

good,"A typical day at work consisted of customer service, re-stock, and cashiering. Fun workplace with great co-workers. The hardest part of the job was the fact that it was part time only and I needed full time work. I learned a great deal about customer service."
good,I had a great time working there and the customers and work environment were great. It was low stress and like every job there are a few things to learn about the job. The late hours are an hour after store closing is when the late hours end.
good,"restock the kitchen to prevent running out. "
good,Awesome environment to work in!!!!!!!!! Flexible around your schedule of college or anything you have going on.
good,"Great team work atmosphere and having the opportunity to read and meet book writers was the best , I would say the hardest part of this job was closing the store at midnight and the traveling at so late hours ."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of working the register, ringing up customers, eating at around 11:00 - 12:00, talking with staff and customers, and boxing shipments to UPS. The managers of the store were always friendly, and happy to see me. The workers were nice, all of them are courteous and say hi in the morning and ask how you are. The hardest part of the job were some of the minuscule tedious tasks like weighing boxes, and replacing some items if they didn't meet the standard. The tedious parts really didn't ruin the experience for me, as the whole time working there, I was always happy."
good,I loved the books- so much to learn and I love how there is always something to do

The digital e-reader also gave me a chance to learn to actually sell customers on a product that they may not have even realized they wanted.

I found that management was direct and expected their expectations to be met. I thoroughly enjoyed the people I worked with. They were the best part of the job. Working with people that are nice makes work not seem like work at all. The hardest part of the job was being there on time at 8:00AM three days a week while taking a full load of classes and studios. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with my fellow employees and with customers."

Yes, there were times where it was stressful and extremely busy; however, the management had your back for everything and will do anything in their power to make it better. I learned many customer relationship skills along with many customer service skills. Since Barnes & Noble does checks, I even learned how to cash a check electronically and even manually! All the coworkers and management made you feel like you were part of one big happy family. If I could, I would work here again in a heartbeat."

It was during my off times while I finished my bachelor's degree.  I left there and that was it."
good,Overall training has improved now from when I first started with the company. Once all the training moved to online with timeline and deadlines (on the job training with pay) all levels of training became much more easier to manage and maintain.
good,Loved my crew and the manager. The pay is decent but nothing to write home about. Really appreciated getting paid vacation hours. The discount was great especially on food. My only complaint was the cookie coupons.

I did a lot of stuff inside the bookstore as restocking merchandise, process textbook orders, and cashier and answer customer questions when needed. The hardest job in this bookstore is handling customers complaints, especially busy days such as textbook rush or admissions. The most enjoyable part of the job is restocking merchandise and straightening up, especially slow days."
good,"On a typical day its very smooth and easy going in the book store. We do a lot of directing, reorganizing, and standing around. there isn't much to the job because most kids come into the book store on the first and last weeks of the semester.

good,A typical day was filled with running textbooks or cleaning what you could. depending on the section you are in you will either be ringing out long lines of students with lots of textbooks or helping students find their books. Management is kind and understanding and while stressful the shifts are always fun. The hardest part is how fast everything moves but the most enjoyable is the people you're on shift with.
good,"The secret to their success is that Barnes & Noble's culture has an exemplary collaborative work environment.  It's because they work so well together, that every single store functions extremely well.  I would love to hold on to this job for as long as possible.  The managers work so well together and make sure that every employee is working the shift that they want to work, and not be forced into any shift that they can't work.  And they work extremely well with students in college and high school.  If you can't work a shift, there is always an employee who is more than happy to pick up that shift.  Wonderful group of employees who step in when needed and know how to cover each other.  There's always something new and wonderful to learn, sometimes on a daily basis which keeps it exciting.  One of the BEST jobs I've ever had."
good,"I was a barista in the cafe and dealing with people that are used to Starbucks was hard.  People would assume things, but it was okay when they were willing to listen to the different.  The food was the best part working in the cafe and being around the books while on break was relaxing."

I learned to be patient and kind toward my coworkers and customers who had issues communicating with me.  I learned to adapt to different management styles and personalities.  The workplace culture was great because I worked with awesome people.  The hardest part of the job for me was working at night.  It was quieter and slower and I'm not a night person by nature.

good,"You receive a mentor upon employment who is there to guide and teach you the ways of the store as you progress from cashier to bookseller, or from cashier to barista.  In my case, I experienced both sides. It's definitely a productive environment where encouragement is given to the fullest and criticism is offered as a catalyst for growth. It's warm, welcoming, and fun to be a part of, and it is tight-knit."
good,My typical shift was spent restocking and weirdly that was my favorite part of the job. All my fellow employees were super professional and nice people.
good,"Working at Barnes & Noble was a fun experience. It was never extremely packed to the point where there were lines out the door, and for the most part it's a pretty quiet, relaxing job.

good,I truly loved working here at Barnes & Noble. It was by far the best retail store I ever worked at. Altho the hours werent that great and pay wasn't so great I enjoyed every minute I worked there. That may just have been because I love books that much. I would work there again.
good,"I was hired to basically do the deposits and to catch up the bookwork. "
good,Being a bookseller at Barnes & Noble was a fantastic learning experience on how to interact with customers and learn what they are looking for.

Very cool events were held there that we got to feel a part of, holidays were beautiful, celebrities were seen, it was really a wonderful experience. There was advancement from within which was awesome cause the potential to move up and make more was there.

Throughout my career with Barnes and Noble I have held other positions including Music Manager, Mercuandise Manager and completed the Store Management training."

good,"It is so awesome to go to work and be around lots and lots of books. Customers are always so excited to read a new book to them, that is at times. I love books"
good,"Regular customers make this job worth it.  You may be crosstrained in Book Selling AND Barista so don't go in thinking youll just talk about books with customers. It's a pretty thankless retail job with the added pressure of barista, but the kind of people who work there and manage it are phenomenal."
good,"I enjoyed myself in this position. It was fulfilling. The only lack was when it came to potential room for growth. There wasn't much, if any. Atmosphere was great."
good,This was one of my absolute favorite jobs. The people are so nice and the company is great to work for. You get to learn alot. And the discount is awesome!
good,"This was one of my favorite jobs I have had. It incorporated my love for people and my interest in books and literature. I was able to recommend books to people and help them find books throughout the store. I thoroughly enjoyed helping people everyday. The hardest part was finding products that our system said we had, yet could not be found on the floor. My management was amazing and always did whatever they could to help us and make us feel appreciated."
good,"On a typical day during busy hours, I would be a bookseller. Since this was a new store and it was transitioning to a restaurant, I decided to apply for dishwasher. I currently still work there, its just now the hours are getting slow. I applied for part-time work, but now its less then part-time. Otherwise, great place to work."
good,The employees are awesome as well as the managers! The team I worked with was very good at communicating with each other and took the time to teach me how to do the job before letting me work on my own.

I learned how to put products on hold for customers, to keep a large store well organized, and to suggestively sell during the holidays. The management was extremely encouraging, helpful, and trained me thoroughly so that I felt prepared. The workplace culture is very inclusive of all genders, sexualities, ethnicities, and ages (ranging from 16 to mid 60s.) The hardest part of the job was working on Black Friday, though the store had a great system and we had enough employees to keep the lines moving and the customers happy. I enjoyed this job so much and even when I go back in to visit the location, everybody greets me with smiling faces."

good,Great place to work ... one can meet many different types of people from all walks of life ... and Learn many different things from the different people and books they buy.
good,I can't rave about this job enough. I know it differs for every store but I would consider all of my coworkers practically family. All of us care and worry about one another. We watch out for each other and the managers don't treat you like a slave. I love working for this store and I love this company.
good,"The college bookstore is a hub for all of your college needs; books, apparel, and snacks. This was such a fun place to work and interact with other students."
good,the store was closing so the managers asked a lot from all the associates. we worked to make sure every book and product were in boxes and packaged correctly and there was no reward. The company seemed to promote young adults who had no idea what they were doing. Also the store manager was extremely judgmental and if he didn't like you from the start then your hours suffered.
good,"I loved working here. It was such a fun, and amazing job. I actually enjoyed going to work, and the employees and managers were all very nice and respectable. If you love books and want to be around people who love them as well I'd strongly suggest applying here!!"

good,"Barnes and Noble is the job I have been at the longest and I could not possibly sing its praises enough. On a typical day, I am happy to work with every single one of my employees and managers and I enjoy all aspects of the job, from keeping up the store to helping customers. The hardest part of the job is the thought that one day I might leave because I've found a better financial opportunity, which is the only downside. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that my coworkers and management really are a team and embody all of the principles of companionship, compassion, and communication that help us make an experience at Barnes and Noble the best it can be."
good,I had the most fun working here because I loved being surrounded by books. The work environment was very relaxed yet fast paced and working here taught me patience.

good,"I love Barnes & Noble! I adore being in the company of books and people that love them! On the average work day, I spoke to patrons and co-workers about great books to read, music, and just life in general. Barnes & Noble offers many perks to employees, my favorite being the ability to ""check out"" any hardcover books!"
good,Being able to greet and assist customers with purchasing or even just answering questions made the work day go by quickly.
good,"Working at Barnes & Noble has allowed me to get to know so many different kinds of customers. We are encouraged to get to know our customers and welcome them to our Barnes & Noble family. I have had many customers return to express their enjoyment of the books they bought. And I have customers come in just to update me on their lives. It is exciting for a customer to bring in her new baby, after meeting her while pregnant and looking for new mom books."
good,"Barnes and noble really helped me grow as an individual. Not only did I learn how to up sell, and how to approach customers, but I also learned how to complete tasks, solve my own work issues, and work hard."

good,"I worked here for maybe 5 months, had a blast. Ended up moving from this area but I was offered to come back that following year. I will never forget the 1/2 starbucks"
good,"A typical day at work for me is organizing the bake case and preparing for close. I almost always change plates and date dots in the bake case. Along with that, I take care of the customers needs as well. The hardest part of the job is when it gets real busy and I constantly have to stop working on the bake case. Some times I run out of things and it makes it look like we are out of a lot things. What I enjoy the most about work is that everyone is friendly and polite, the customers and other employees."
good,Barnes and Noble is a great place to work. I enjoy working with people and the faced pace of the cafe. I enjoy taking my breaks on the book floor and enjoying the peace and many options of reading material.
good,"Barnes & Noble was one of the best places I've worked. I worked at a college bookstore rather than an average Barnes and Noble. It was definitely busy. My boss was very hands on. She was not afraid to get down and dirty with us to mop floors and dust. Barnes and Noble gave plenty of options to move up within the store and even provided options for supervisor/manager training. It was a very relaxing atmosphere. We had a lot of fun but, we did a lot of work."
good,"I worked mostly at the customer service desk, but I would also help out as a barista and a cashier. At the customer service desk, I would complete daily projects, such as new books and other merchandise placement. (New Release tables and New York Bestseller displays). However, the main responsibility was to help every customer find what they were looking for, place orders, or make recommendations in a friendly manner. (In person and over the phone). In the cafe, I would make drinks, serve food, clean, and stock. I learned how to better engage with people and how rewarding finding that special book for someone can be. The management team here, as well as my fellow co-workers, were among the greatest people I have ever worked with. Everything was handle in such a professional manner but no one was over bearing. The workloads were even shared and I believe that is what helped everyone get along. The hardest part was learning how to engage a customer while also including relevance to books and other merchandise in the store. The most enjoyable part of this job was being around the books themselves. I have always been such an avid reader and being able to help others find their love of reading was amazing. Helping someone find that new book by their favorite author, or helping a child find that first book that really grabs their attention, it's all so rewarding."
good,"There's not much hustle and bustle around the Home Office at Barnes & Noble, which helps everyone to focus on what the company needs and how it can grow. Everyone's friendly; there's a sense of family, even if it's tough to know everyone's names."
good,I got this job as a seasonal worker which lasted about a month but was really fun. You are either a cashier or on the floor helping students find their books. the hardest part of the job was when a customer didn't have their schedule of their classes so we couldn't find their books as fast.
good,"Even though it was only seasonal you come up to learn a lot, and people are always friendly and willing to work. A typical day consisted of checking if the floor was organized and sometimes being in the cashier when it was too busy so people wouldn't be waiting."
good,"Came in to work and prepped the bake case, cups, drinks, etc. for the start of the day and made hand crafted coffee for customers. Communicated efficiently with my team and exercised great teamwork."
good,"Enjoyable work environment, fast-paced, meet variety of people which keeps the job interesting. Regular benefits. Friendly, helpful managers."
good,Surrounded by great book lovers and customers all day. The quiet environment and atmosphere is very comfortable to work in. It was a relaxing simple job.
good,"- An opportunity to meet and work with interesting people."
good,This was a positive experience. Great company with good benefits and good work/life balance. Great management both at store location and in corporate structure.
good,"It's an awesome place to work if you're a book and all over media buff. It can be hard to work there being on the younger side since they specialize in hiring people in retirement. That also makes it more difficult to be promoted to higher positions. Otherwise, it's a great place to work. The discount is amazing and there's free meals for holidays."
good,"Typical day at work would be helping out customers on what they were looking for or their orders and cleaning and organizing book shelves. I learned a lot about books, since I wasn't a bookworm. Time management was well taught, and the managers always had good strategies on how to organize things running. My co-workers were always helpful and respectful. The hardest part of the job was helping customers out on lost orders and organizing children's section. The most enjoyable part is seeing customers come and get books, especially seeing younger children read at such young ages."
good,The schedule was very flexible. The management was very understanding when it came to certain situations. I learned alot of new things through the training process. My coworkers were very polite and helpful as a new employee.

good,"Working at Barnes & Noble is a lot of fun. Some days when it's fast paced, you feel energetic and some days when it's slow, it's very boring. The co workers are fantastic, always helping out others in need and extremely loyal. The only hard part of the job is dealing with rude customers which only rarely happens. The hours are very reasonable and flexible. The pay is also fair and reasonable."

good,The people are really friendly and everybody works as a team. Since I have been there I have learned how to work together as a team. I have learned that the customer is always right. The bosses at Barnes and noble takes good care of all of their employees and give a fair amount of shifts. The hardest part of the job is I dont get enough hours. The most enjoyable part of the job is I know how to make many yummy flavored Steamed drinks/ice drinks/and frozen drinks.
good,Spending time with fun people and lots of activities to keep you on your toes made this a fun and interesting place to work.
good,"Excellent environment to work in for people who love books, being around other people. Working at Barnes and Noble has structure and I knew what I was supposed to be doing at all times and had the ability, resources, and team members to complete my tasks. I learned the ins and outs of bookselling and customer service and sales. Co-workers are easy to get along with because most work at Barnes and Noble due to a common interest in books. I felt safe and secure working at Barnes and Noble and would have continued working there had I not needed to move."
good,I enjoyed my time with girl scouts. it was challenging yet rewarding.  I liked that i got to be my own leader and inspire not only the young girls i worked with but myself
good,The job was easy. Finding books for customers was hard and sometimes impossible at times. Our regulars were fun to talk to and definitely made the job easier. Some even helped other customers if we got too busy. The management was by far the best ive ever worked with. The other co-workers were nice and laid back. I guess one of the downfalls for me was trying not to spend money every time i went in to work. There was always some book or trinket that i found that at the time i felt like i needed.
good,"I love working at Barnes and Noble, it is an easy going job. Never any problems with the job. The vibe between the coworkers is good and it's like a family."

However, everyone I worked with was willing to help and very friendly. The company culture is wonderful, the employees generally seem happy to be working there!

good,"I love working at Barnes & Noble. I am cross trained as a Café Server and a Bookseller, so a typical day for both parts of my job consists of greeting customers, up-selling, selling memberships, and making sure the customers were able to receive whatever product they needed to the best of our ability. A typical day as a Café Server requires a fair amount of maintenance to ensure our Café always looks lovely and baking to ensure we have all the promised products our customers might be craving. I also restocked our food products throughout the store as needed. A Bookseller’s typical day is mostly spent as a cashier but I go where I am needed and I often organize the bookshelves, restock the magazine stand, and help customers locate books that they need, or order their needed item online for them. While at Barnes & Noble I learned how to make our Café’s drinks and prepare our Café’s food according to the standards. I learned how to calm down a long line of customers and keep up with the fast pace of working in the Café. I learned how to work on the book floor and use a PDT, how to organize displays so that they are appeasing to the eye, how to sell memberships, and improved my ability to think quickly while under pressure. My co- workers are all great people who are very kind and easy to work with. The hardest part of my job was learning to stay calm and efficient during a rush of people. The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with the customers and knowing that they left Barnes & Noble smiling and happy because of me."
good,"I began Barnes and Noble as a bookseller, just your basic customer service employee with a firm understanding of the store layout and placement. I shortly became Head Cashier after proving myself able to sell Barnes and Noble Memberships to customers. I would stay up from at the cash registers, ring out customers and sell Memberships as much as possible. I would be in charge of all the money in the store both at the beginning of the day, and at the end of the night. I would also train new employees, both on the register and on the floor. "
good,I enjoyed my tenure at Barnes and Noble and would go back for seasonal.
good,"go over the daily task with my co-worker ensure that everyone understand the task, make sure the orders are out on time"
good,"A typical day at work was you would come in and get everything ready to be sold like your bake case, coffee, your soups ect. If you were opening, or if you were closing you would be cleaning up as the night goes on to get ready to close. I learned how to multitask very well and make complicated Starbucks drinks.  Management was very nice and they made sure to tell you the things you did wrong. The co workers were always willing to help you because you are a team you should help one another. The hardest part of the job was when you would have a long line of people and you would be alone so you would have to ring them up and make drinks all alone. The Most Enjoyable part was being able to Make people happy all day with coffee and various snacks."
good,I absolutely loved working for Barnes and Noble. I loved the atmosphere and all the employees were like family. There is a lot of opportunity for growth and advancement and I loved that they promote within. They have great benefit's and the discounts are stellar. It is a very fast paced high volume company without any downtime. I would love to continue within this company but I understand that there are only so many positions available for us to relocate to a different location. It breaks my heart to see our store closing but I thank Barnes and Noble for all the knowledge I have acquired and for making me the strong and confident business women i am today!!!!
good,"A typical day at work is not something that I can give you exact details. This job is one that you just had to go with the flow and adapt to the ever changing situations. Some points during that day would be busy and others would be slow. During these times we were required to keep busy, do bake case, clean, restock, or work on your assigned task for the day. "

This job was always up and ready to be exciting, from meeting new customers that would travel from far and foreign countries to having the great employers there. The job was simple.

Set up the meetings and scheduled other meetings to the boss."
good,Barnes and noble is a great company to work for. The customers are generally very friendly and look forward to a booksellers opinion on the latest titles and what is trending. I also look forward to working closely with the my co-workers and management who generally share the same passion about books that I do and are always very friendly and helpful towards anything you or the customers need. Overall I find working here to be very enjoyable however it is not easy work and requires dedication and attention to detail to follow through with deadlines and fall in line with or exceed expectations.
good,This was the best job. It was simple but so much fun. My co-workers were the nicest people and they all looked out for each other. FAU bookstore is the true definition of the word teamwork this includes all employees and management. Management was super friendly and loved their jobs so much. The hardest thing about working their was if they had me work in the back with the books. I had general knowledge but when it came down to the specifics I forgot some needed information because this was not my usual job.The best part of this job was all the people the faculty and the students that shopped there.

good,Around a lot of books each day so its easy to obtain knowledge you didn't know. Co-workers were always telling me to read a new book or magazine. The hardest part of my job was not to read or wanting to read something new.

good,I learned how to be organized and clean working for the company I kept up with the skills even now.
good,I very much enjoyed my time at Barnes and Noble and would highly recommend employment with this company.
good,"Best job that I've ever had, hands down. Management was awesome, and my fellow co-workers were great people. I worked at a B&N college bookstore location, so most of our customers were doctors, professors, college staff or students, and they were all so nice. We had a Starbucks cafe connected to our location, and got 30% off their drinks, and 50% off on fridays! An average day at work would be shipping out and receiving books from UPS, stocking the floor with new release titles, and shipped items, Helping customers find their desired book title using our book masters program. The most enjoyable part of the job was probably the luxury to read during slow periods of the work day. The hardest part of the day was when we closed, because I loved it too much!"
