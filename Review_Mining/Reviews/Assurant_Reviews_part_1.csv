rating,review
bad,"Upper Management is horrible, they micromanage everything. In the renters, home departments have a extremely high turnover rate.  You are overworked and underpaid. Starting salaries don't compare to other insurance companies. Only work here if you're desperate.  The amenities are the best part of the job."
bad,"Only work here if you're in a higher up role, don't work on the phones. You're cattle to them. They treat you worse than cattle though, honestly the worst job I've ever had. They owe me holiday pay from 2014 but because I was young they just pretended they didn't owe it to me. Avoid."
bad,Management expecte you to be perfdct with 100% QA every time or they write you up. Management sits in their cubicals and never are willing to help with anything. This is the worst place I have ever worked in my entire life. Mildred Higgins is the worst manager...she will call a meeting and talks to the group like you are scum of the earth she curses at you. Awful person!!!
bad,Although I was working through a temp agency...the manager at the time...mind you the client I worked for had 3 managers in my short time there  promised me if I had perfect attendance for two months they’d hire me on around that same time the manager knew they would be letting me go in a month. Higher management is more or less on a power trip than making the company better  there is so much going on in that building I wonder how companies let them work for them. Letting a single mother go without warning when you knew a month ahead of time is disrespectful mind you they also informed me by email I will never advise anyone to work for this failing company
bad,"Horrible place to work, was micromanaged by manager. Ask for help or guidance from manager and she was clueless on what was going on. But was more willing to yell at you for anything and everything. Lack of work ethics or standards, and in fact manager should been fired. Poor or bad management skills.. In fact she didn’t have any people skills.  "
bad,We are sorry to hear that you are having trouble with your device. We are currently aware of this issue and have sent this over to our developers who are working diligently towards a resolution. We appreciate your patience.
bad,Assurant pays pretty good. The benefits are ok as well. I dont have much to say concerning the job. This will completer my review concerning this role
bad,There is nothing to say. It's been said over and over by many others. Poorly managed and immature leadership. No effort to improve. Lots of time on useless roadmaps while the entire place falls apart.
bad,"The customers were angry most of the time , the job was hectic, the management was horrible , the people that worked there were ""clique-ish"" and very childish and one-sided ....its a horrible company to work for."
bad,"Sweat shop, no work home balance. Revolving doors. No clear objectives, favoritism, wrong perceptions and assumptions. CIO, SVP and sr management - all ""retired"" in the past 9 mo. Run...."
bad,I don't recommend this place at all. They want you to work hard and don't appreciate your work. peoples snitching other peoples others believing they would opt for a raise. Supervisors go out every time and last 30 or 45 minutes smoking and when the employee needs them they are never there because they are smoking and managers don't care. F*** ASSURANT
bad,"Il s'agit d'une plateforme téléphonique en open space, où les salariés sont collés les uns aux autres."
bad,We weren't allowed to go off script to ask a customer how their day was or to build rapport. It was horrible you'd get pulled into an office and they would make you listen to you calls and have a document with everything you did wrong and you had to SIGN IT. I had a manager tell me they prioritized professionalism over friendliness
bad,"The environment was unprofessional and the people they had in charge were unprofessional. Also, no real work life balance. They require certain people to work EVERY weekend"
bad,"Job is very stressful, and they love to say when you get out of training you will have team support if you need help.That is a lie. Team leads who are there to help DO NOT. They hire managers who do not know the job to help either.  Low pay for the stress. Also managers/ team members gossip too much."
bad,"Managers are friends of somebody, with no experience. They work ridiculous and unnecessary OT. They hire contractors, let them go, then hire contractors ... Thinking they are saving money, but in reality, they are loosing money. Inexperienced C level positions."
bad,"This company went downhill since they went public, they don't care about the employees management is a complete joke"
bad,"Treated horribly  under appreciated and if you were on the phone past your scheduled lunch you wouldn’t get one! "
bad,DO NOT WORK for this terrible company.  They are the absolute worst.  I’m so glad I don’t work there anymore.  They don’t care about their staff. They care about money only.
bad,"No respect from other staffs. Specially some  supervisors and Team managers support only who know them.Hard work not recognised. Racist and bullied. All the managers support to supervisors and Team managers.They don’t care about staffs. Only they support who they know. "
bad,"Productive environment-if you are going for management positions it helps if you are a self starter, willing to engage with others to find and provide results.  A lot of progression from within, and you have opportunities toy shadow other departments and attend meetings that include management and employees from across different lines of business."
bad,"If you want to work somewhere that is stressful and they do't pay you your worth this is the place for you. They don't pay you a living wage. Also they benefit package that they have costs an arm and a leg, also if you dont op out of it they will charge you an arm and a leg each check"
bad,This is a horrible company to work for. They count against you for being 2 minutes late. There is no grace period to log onto the phone. If something happens with the system which is normally the case unless you screen shot what happens and send it to all the 7 managers at that time while trying to log on it counts against you. Everything counts against you. Not to mention nothing drops off until it’s been on file for a full year! I thought that the reviews would not apply to me..... I was soooo wrong. Do yourself a favor and don’t waste your time.
bad,"Turnover rate extremely high,lack of growth for minorities"
bad,I didn't agree with working at a company that would hire and promote people off of the street quicker than people that are already trying to get a better position. It seemed that it didn't matter how hard you worked getting promoted was not the intention. The pay did not keep up with the COL and we had to get a certain score to even get a couple of pennies for a raise at the end of the year.
bad,"As a short stop gap this is an easy way to earn money. As a long term career avoid them like the plague. It's a soul destroying job that long term will ruin your mental health due to the constant angry and abusive customers, the poor management and terrible shifts. "
bad,"This company would be okay if it's managers were effectively trained how to deal with their employees. They discuss you behind your back and don't judge you on your work. There is no advancement you are stuck in positions for years and can't get out unless you quit. Management will see you and not speak unless upper management is around. The pay based on cost of living is not adequate.  They choose who they deal with in management unless you are in a key position and they have to deal with you. "
bad,"training was poor"
bad,"Minimal pay, disrespectful management and stressful environment.  Daily work requirements do not coincide with the compensation given.  No room for growth unless you're a favorite.  Very unprofessional environment."
bad,"Before the Warranty Group was bought by Assurant, it was sold to a private equity firm, then to another private equity firm.  Salaries were cut, hours were extended.  Many layoffs, etc.  I would hope that things might improve with the sale to Assurant.  Assurant did get rid of executives who had made bad decisions once the sale was complete."
bad,"I was very recently employed in the Duluth office.  (no I was not terminated).   I have been in 2 different departments, but they are both a mess.  The call center is the worst.   This organization is more about who you know over what you know and skill.  I as not trying to excel with the company, but I have watched as many people have promoted that do not have the skill or knowledge to be in the positions they have. The numbers show what is going on but that means nothing.  The feedback from the team members speak to the poor leadership, but that does not mean anything. The cycle continues to repeat itself.     I have been in management for years and have never see anything like it.  Managers have left because it goes against there morals and ethics.  This was really a miserable place to work and I am not alone in this statement."
bad,"Poor management on day shift and late shift in the warehouse in Newcastle under Lyme. No unsocial hours pay. Disgusting attitude of employees towards each other because management are laid back and some are too scared to approach anyone. No communication between managers and staff working below them. Managers don't know much themselves to pass onto other staff below them. Lots of favouritism. Managers support those who they like or who know more about the job than they do. Managers work in this place because they have been recommended by their friend who is a manager, even though they don't know anything about the job. Hard work is not recognised by management. Unfriendly and not so approachable managers."
bad,company too focused on numbers - no concern for employee - not a good place to work - very stressful environment and every month was  possibly career ending
bad,"Everyone's worry to survive till the next paycheck cut, the work gets done when it's done."
bad,If you like to be told by 25 people how to do your job then this is the place for you. Their QA policies are a joke too. It's not what you know it's who you know.
bad,"Free food, basically every day, and there's a self-serve convenient store in the break room, both of which are awesome for the business because everyone has the appearance of eating nonstop."
bad,Fired the good workers and kept the bad ones. Had to meet standards that couldn't even be meet by management. Very stressful to have them review your calls and if you went beyond the time it took to help the customer you were taken off points but you helped the customer to not have to call back in again.
bad,this is a pass by job NOT A CAREER not professional and the managers don't know nothing use the good person around to make them look good again NOT A CAREER
bad,Bad working environment. Very disorganized. Too many lay offs and changes. There is a gossip culture. People are easily threatend by new people. Is is a very tense place to work.
bad,Assurant used be associated with a great culture but that does not hold true anymore. Everything is productivity and numbers based. Essentially more work with no pay increase or incentive. No management support. No advancement. Very disheartening. Not the place I once knew and enjoyed.
bad,I started this job as a job in between jobs.  The workplace was extremely boring but the people made it fun. The supervisors did not really know who to supervise and it felt like no one really knew how to do the job I was given. So training was very limited.
bad,"This job is very stressful and inconsistent. You are rated on your calls with customers. On one call, you can do everything right and get a 5 star. On the next call, it can be the exact same situation, you go through everything with the customer just like you did the first call. If you word something just a little different, you can get an auto fail. They are always changing the rules about how to handle certain types of calls or requests from the customers. Management is horrible. They definitely show favoritism towards certain employees. They say that you have a great chance of quickly moving up in the ranks but almost ever single manager was hired from outside the company. You have lots of customers screaming at you because sometimes we cannot replace their device due to insurance guidelines. You only have a certain amount of time to file a claim. Some customers wait until after the time has expired. When this happens, we cannot replace the device so the customer gets upset and starts screaming and cussing at you."
bad,"This place is a joke! The managers are very funny and scary like clowns...Never seen anything like it. This job is very very stressful. They go by qa and other stuff that's not important lol....They time you going to the bathroom, lunch, breaks whatever.  They have their picks with people like any other job. Its so much discrimnation going its so sad..Its so hard for african americans especially the ones who trying to work and provide for their family and along with that we have our own people help other races bring us down..Im so over it!"
bad,This is a review of the North Richland Hills location not Assurant as a whole company. The managers are lacking in communicative skills and work against their employees instead of with them to assist in career growth. The company has no understanding of their staff and just lets people go who have been there 5 plus years without 2nd thought.
bad,A good place to work if you have no conscience and do not mind being yelled at by customer who feel they have been defrauded on a daily basis.  Management is short sighted and does not care for it's employees.
bad,"Multiple fails...."
bad,This company is fast pace expects a lot from it's employees who are grossly under pay for service provider. It's and unsafe and environment and management lack managerial skills and are  not people originated.
bad,The manager was sexually abusive to female staff and you could not even report to HR because they were in the manager's pocket. There was no room for advancement and co-workers were rude and disrespectful
bad,I worked as security HORRIBLE.  The ones that been there needs to go. Security management was scary all the manager did was yell watch ratchet shows didn't know her job at all. Such a sad sad place. Can be a great place the trainer and manager needs to go THEY ARE CROOKS AND NOBODY LIKES THEM
bad,"easy job but but management doesn't care "
bad,I loved all of the people that I worked with but everyone who called to file had no idea you had to pay at least 200 to get a new phone so I got yelled at daily/
bad,Most stressful job I’ve ever had. Horrible work experience.  Processing mortgage insurance for different customers loans. Processed insurance payments.
bad,I lasted a day at Assurant and all I can say that it is such an awful office to work in. The girls are bully's and will try and humiliate you while your sat right next to them! No one bothered to introduce them self on my first day nor did anyone even speak to me! My team leader didn't even bother to introduce who they were! Hours and money are poor and everyone walks round thikining there are 'somebody' not a welcoming place at all and is full of awful people I would avoid at all cost!
bad,"Favortism, Racism"
bad,Company relies on favoritism and unqualified people to make decisions. When issues arise incorrect data is used to come to a conclusion. One associate can complain about something and if they are in the circle then you are the bad guy. Company in my opinion was toxic and not a place to grow your career.
bad,"Highly stressful environment to work in with long hours and shifts. "
bad,"A typical day at work , management was ran very poorly , the manager was involved in certain peoples personal life hard to get a day off without having to explain in details why you needed it . The wrong people to lead the company , favortism, unappreciated  of their workers"
bad,This place of employment will suck the life out of you and your family. You are under paid. Under appreciated. And any opportunities to grow within the business are given to people who are friendly with management.
bad,Company used us as a buffer during their self inflicted credit card lawsuits brought forward by government regulations. JP Morgan Chase contracted call center. Used awful scripts when customers read about credit card improprieties.
bad,"Process mortgage insurance for thousands of homeowners.  Make updates and pay premiums.  Quality Reports.  Being a Team Player and being able to work overtime when needed.  I learned multiple systems Kronos, Smartflow, Black Knight, Exel, Word.  This is a very non discriminatory company to work for.  The most difficult part of the job was not being able to ask questions in a timely manner.  The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to meet new associates, and keep homeowners insurance in goodstanding."
bad,I didn't like the way they paid you. The managers were not good supervisors. When you went to work didn't know if you would have work to do or not. Just wasn't steady enough for me.
bad,Management covers up there incompetency by getting rid of those who bring there inabilities to there attention.  Only work there if it is an obsolute must.
bad,This company no longer exists.  It was sold off to NGIC who is doing a great job.  But calling this company will not get you a job as they are no longer around.
bad,"if you have a slacker mentality or just need somewhere to work until you find something else , this may be the place for you. Not a good place to work"
bad,"Would not work for this company again. High stress levels, inconsistent direction, no clear policy, degraded by supervisor. Nothing positive about this company as the experience was a nightmare and I was there for almost 2 years trying to find the best and keep going because I needed the money. Mental health was so damaged I had to leave the company. Felt forced out because talking to management and nothing changed. Felt I was disregarded completely."
bad,This is a great company to work for it not the company it the people that works for the company you have to be on pins and needles when working for this company
bad,They are no longer in business but they a good company to work for.  There is no feedback due to them no longer existing as a company.
bad,Do not work for assurant unfair company bad phones company no good do not treat people fairly at all they do not follow there own rules and regulations
bad,Not a great place to work .Too much into performance driving and not about the customer. They also pay temps more verses direct hires. The 3 years I worked there I was assigned to three different clients. Very unstable work environment with high turnover ratio. The pay was also a factor. Who wants to work for a 1% pay raise?
bad,"I see some of the ""Good"" reviews and I asked myself. Are we taking about the same company? I worked for Assurant Solutions Customer Care, ""Client"" was (JP Morgan Chase Bank). 1st couple of years were OK, just happy to have a job at that time in the economy, 1 or 2 week training & you were ""thrown"" on the floor, there were so many variations to something that should have been standardized."
bad,"Was a good company when I started 4 yrs ago. But new management came in and fired and laid off multiple departments, schedule changes every three months based on stats , Raises are a joke, No career growth opportunities available unless the manager likes you. Unrealistic KPI GOALS!!!!  co-workers was the best part of the job with out them my 4 years would have been a waste of time."
bad,A typical day starts at 6:30 and ends at 3 pm.  Quiet environment most of the days. Good company to work for. Management staff needs to communicate better.  Four Stars
bad,"I worked at Assurant for two months before I quit. They have a terrible environment for breastfeeding moms. I had 2 breaks of 15 minutes to pump, and I had to go to the nearest restroom to pump because I was penalized if it took more than those 15 minutes. What mom can pump in 15 min???.The stressful environment of a call center and the way that they handle it was a nightmare. They didn't follow the Affordable Care Act that support breastfeeding moms."
bad,"The office can be a good environment if you want to be part of a click, the job is what you make of it. The environment with the air con is always on so the place full of germs but when you get ill there is no empathy given by any sort of management."
bad,"why do I have to do this? I did not like this company but that doesn't matter if you need a job, you need a job.i don't want my rating to stop others from applying, they may be happy there. Also, there isn't many office environment jobs to chose from in Florence sc in the first place."
bad,"Hiring process duration was four months. Was employed for three months by a ""non-micromanager"" boss.  Then three months later, department reorganized and was assigned to a micro-manager boss who started in company as a file clerk. New boss reorganized and eliminated my position and outsourced my functional duties."
bad,"I worked there almost 5 years, did not receive adequate compensation, took an act of God to get a day off, they always added more for you to do without compensating you, and they wanted you to do everything faster than when you had less to do"
bad,"They will lure you in with the promise of a REAL job when the recruiters post you a decent salary before hire, then they HIRE you and tell you to come in for an orientation WITHOUT disclosing the REAL very poor LOW salary!!!Watch Out!!"
bad,"So glad I left Assurant and never ever have to look back. ..words can't explain how unprofessional this company is to their employees.  There is no room for growth and managers are never available to assist with an escalated call, due to they are all on smoke breaks, pretending to be in a meeting.  People,  please run for the hills if you are currently employed for nationstar mortgage as their client..need I say more!"
bad,"great work atmosphere, great people to work with"
bad,I worked here for five years..i got 50 cents in raises while working here...always had good reviews...the management is a bunch of condescending pricks who have their heads up their posterior...run away...run away
bad,"I worked at the location in Duluth, GA. It is probably the 2nd most horrible job that I've ever had in life. Management at this location is a joke, they pick favorites over credentials, and you can't advance depending on which department you get placed in. Unless you REALLY need a job in this area...I wouldn't apply here. The company has other branches perhaps they aren't as bad, but this one SUCKS!"
bad,"Assurant Employee Benefits Review"
bad,This is a 3rd party company who services mortgages. It is an experience in which I have had the pleasure of getting. The environment itself is not as professional as it should be. The co workers are the best part of the job. They all try to make it worth while coming to work.
bad,"I worked for this company for nearly ten years,their main issue is that they are very heavy on management and they do not treat their employees very well.There is also no room to advance within the facility."
bad,"Poor pay, management, and procedures.  Micro-management.  No recognition.  Employees work OT due to poor planning.  Treated like a number."
bad,"I worked at the facility on Willow Springs Lane. The HR director is unreal and completely unrealistic. As a new hire you will be ok, but as you gain time in the company, you will become his target to fire. There is different rules for different people, if an error occurs that is out of your control such as a computer issue, time clock which we aren't aloud to use anyway, then you will still be written up. You are belittled in the company and expected to give them your all when they cant even understand a computer issue is out of your control. You can exceed their expectations, but you will not get noticed for them, but you will get notice because the HR director will still say it wasn't good enough. The benefits aren't that great and your co-pays are outrageous for the amount that you pay in insurance. you don't get decent pay raises at all."
bad,they are horrible..callers are horrible. the companies do not care about their employees.
bad,"streetlinks is extremely unorganized and micromanaged. Train you in 4 days and throw you in the floor. They had us handling phones even without phone training then reprimand us. Don't be a second late by clocking in because they will write you up. Literally. "
bad,Most of the people that work there are very unfriendly or helpful to new hires.  They don't want to talk to you and they don't want you to talk to them.  Management is total more focused on your personal life than running the business.  DO NOT WORK HERE IF YOU CAN HELP IT!
bad,"I've had a opportunity to learn different things in the sense of owning your home, dealing with contractors. Assurant helps you learn different fields and task through out any job duties that is presented to you."
bad,"Was told by management that I needed to join a church so that I could ""adopt"" a grandparent for my children to enable me to work when they were sick."
bad,Salary is below industry average & heavy work load. Very little room for advancement.
bad,"it was strictly data entry, very tight working environment."
bad,Management is only supportive of those who they socialize with.  Your views and opinions aren't valued.  Managements' bonuses are based on your quality scores (which need to be at 97%+).  Internal process/ office battles take away from job performance.
bad,"Terrible place to work! Would be an OK place to work if not for the terrible managers and outdated policies and ridiculous excuse for training. It's like you are set up for failure from the jump. I used to laugh at people who said ""Oh, watch out, my managers out to get me!"" I used to think that was hilarious until it actually happened to me. I got railroaded right out of a job and it is really sad that this kind of thing can happen in 2014. My complaints to HR went unheard and were swept under the rug. My former coworkers are still there and miserable and still feeling like new-age slaves chained to a desk. The silver lining to my terrible experience is that I am FINALLY FREE to detox from that harmful situation and move on in a productive way with my life/career without fear or retaliation from a boss from hell and management/corporate culture that completely condones setting employees up for failure and harassing them until they are out of a job."
bad,"Poor management, poor structure, poor benifits, and no room to grow or excel. Unplesant."
bad,"Never get to comfortable with this organization, you can be let go at any time without notice."
bad,This company only cares about the size of their bonus checks .  The kicker not all bonus are the same.....they expect you to work 47 hours a week and remind you of your big bonus in March.  They truely do not care about their employees.
bad,I answered several calls daily. I learned something's about home lending. Mangers were fair. Great co-workers very helpful. The hardest part was remembering to verify each account on every call. The most enjoyable part was help our homeowners.
bad,"•	Accountable for responding to customer inquiries in a high volume inbound call center environment by correspondence and direct telephone contact. "
bad,"busy, learned plenty, good management, horrible co workers, pay horrible, didn't enjoy job"
bad,A typical day at work. Co-workers very good to work with despite of the workload.
bad,"They have no open door policy, if you are having trouble in the work place my advice is to keep it to yourself because it will only get you terminated."
bad,I recently left this company because the work environment is very unpleasant. I worked in the general accounting area and the supervisors are very degrading of the staff and senior management does absolutely nothing to discourage this which is why I chose to leave the company altogether . It is hard to advance in this company because there are people there that take great measures to throw you under the bus because they have no skills or real talent to contribute and are jealous when others advance in their position. There is constant gossip and back stabbing amongst staff. The hardest part of the job was having to work in such a harsh environment with terrible people. Would not recommend as a place of employment.
bad,"A typical day of work is being tied to your desk with no respect for human conditions, if you have to leave your desk, points are being deducted and seconds counted."
bad,"They took away bonus, phones, GPS,raises are VERY low. They do not care about their employees. Layoffs are frequent Managers and their bosses do not care about the employees."
bad,Assurant could be a good place of employment except it does not allow for proper career growth. There are many areas in which things could have been a lot better. There isn't an adequate sense of work life balance. This in turn makes for a very stressful and unhealthy work life.
bad,"One of the worsts places to work ever. Management were about as useful as a chocolate fire guard, dealing with horrible customers and not having the management help left you with no where to go. "
bad,The job itself is not difficult management however makes this a stressful environment. It’s not what you know but WHO you know that advances your career. I have never been more unhappy at a place of employment.
bad,"poor team work, lack of support, judgement on the bilingual, no development , no one on one,no proper training, lack of employee, work load too big , ."
bad,"The manager will definitely throw you under the bus after assisting them in meeting their numbers, you have to call another city to get an approval to release funds that should have been sent weeks before, it’s about the quantity not the quality and it’s major favoritism. If you feed the manager most likely you will get a raise.They keep a training class.  Very inconsistent."
bad,"This was a horribly stressful job. You are yelled at several times a day by customers because they're mad about their experience with the company and  even though it's not your fault you still bear the weight of their threats, insults and cursing. I once had a customer tell me to go jump of a bridge because I told him his package would be late and apologized profusely for the delay."
bad,"That place is full of nepotism. If you are a female you are subject to harassment by the management staff. They don’t care about you, they care about them. The place is not safe for young females. HR is corrupt, it will betray you if you speak up. No ethics and morals in the management staff. I have a social responsibility to alert females out there to not consider this company."
bad,"Don't waste your time!! There is very little way to advance unless you know the right people. Worked there for nine years and was never able to advance after a restructure of the company put me under someone who for no good reason had it out for me and made it impossible to work there, very hostile work environment."
bad,"The business culture at the Duluth, GA office is awful. Extremely unprofessional and managers are terrible.  Do not work here if you want to grow professionally. Most people here are not happy."
bad,"Great benefits, but bad management. Not a good company if you want job security. There are always layoff events when ever there's a business need. Unrealistic expectations"
bad,The Warranty Group is a company consumed by internal politicking and maneuvering to climb over others in order to advance yourself. Upper management has created such a poor work culture that it has infected seemingly every other level of management in the company.
bad,I currently work in customer care for property loss and it's a nightmare. I wouldn't recommend anyone to work there. There is little room for moving up in the company. It's often hard to get help when you need it as well with a phone call. I know people that have been there 3-4 years and have never received a pay raise. I'm trying to catch the first thing smoking out of there. I don't know anyone on the customer care side that likes it. This company is also not for someone that has a family or small children. I'm currently on my 3rd schedule since I started there last April.
bad,"this isn't a bad company to work for, if you enjoy working in a call center. I did not like how the pay schedule was, you get paid on the 15th and 30th of each month, something they do not tell you in the interview, if you work overtime, you don't get paid until a month later! and the training they provide for the job is only 7 days, before they put you on the phone."
bad,It is a job that is just that. Not very professional atmosphere and the pay is not great. I did not stay long to see if there was real potential for advancing.
bad,"Days at Assurant are long and grueling. You are expected to be at your desk and on the phone at ALL TIMES. 10 minutes for bathroom time. 30 minutes for lunch. Two 15 minute breaks. If you exceeded ANY of these things, you were written up. The pay was lousy. The hardest part was being yelled at by fed up customers and the lack of help Assurant provided for you to help the customer. Some managers understood the frustration, but the higher-ups really didn't care. The one good thing I can say is that the customer service record looked good on my resume. That's about it, though."
bad,Management was inconsistent. Work environment encouraged favoritism.  Unprofessional work culture. This job would only be beneficial to someone in transition to an actual career.
bad,"Very stressful environment where"
bad,The pay is substandard and often capricious. Management is oblivious to the feelings of the employees. There is constant infighting and squabbles. It is toxic.
bad,"My time at Assurant was the most stressful occupation I have ever had. The management, when they are there, don't seem to understand that their employees are not just robots and have no appreciation for when one of their employees has to be called away for an emergency, my daughter was in hospital and they demanded me to work until end of my shift before going to see if she was okay. This was only one of the occasions of unappreciation that I personally felt there and many others who I spoke to also felt. I would never recommend you work here unless you enjoy masochism!"
bad,Wasn’t very “family friendly.” They threatened my job every time something came up with my children. It was a very stressful environment and I always felt like I was walking on egg shells. One wrong mistake and you’d be worried if that was going to cost you your job. Some managers were and are still great managers but as for a whole Assurant stinks.
bad,"I was working with this company since January when I had the opportunity to leave and I took it so fast. There was a new department that they just opened so a lot of it was new for them but the people they selected to be in management either didn’t know anything to help you or would be extremely rude when trying to help. I’ve also encountered a situation that was hostile with one of their tenured representatives which they did little to nothing to implement any kind of repercussions. 2 months into my employment here, they had a door open to promote but the test that they made us take had nothing to do with the position that was open. I wrote an email to the manager with my concern and no one ever replied or acknowledged it. Management lacked a lot in communication and if they don’t like you, you’re pretty much disposable. If you know you are qualified or even overqualified, please know your worth and do not let this place lowball you into working and getting underpaid. They will suck the life and happiness out of you."
bad,"A typical day is sitting for 10 hours chained to a desk fixing cell phones."
bad,"Looking back on my time at this company I wish I would have listened to the people in my town who have had nothing good to say about it. It was the coldest most unfriendly place I have ever worked. We were not allowed to even speak to co-workers. The management was very unprofessional and seemed uneducated and inarticulate most of the time. They claimed to be subject matter experts but did not even know how to do what we were supposed to do. They certainly did not have any people skills or knowledge of how to properly manage personnel. We were not allowed to ask our managers or team leaders questions and we're instead left to try to figure things out by Skyping our coworkers. We were not given consistent training or on-boarding and were just thrown to the wolves and expected to know everything about mortgage insurance and what to do with it. Then when questions were asked we were condescended by co-workers for not already knowing the answer, even embarrassed in staff meetings for being new or unaware. The people in my town refer to this place as a data sweatshop, and it felt like that. We were expected to be robots and were made to feel expendable. Locals warned me to run from there as soon as I got hired and asked why I ever applied there. I didn't really think it would be that bad but it was worse than I expected and I was so happy to leave. I would not recommend this place to anyone. The pay and time off and benefits are not so bad but going in there every day was the most stressful job experience I've ever had to the point of making me miserable and physically sick. There"
bad,I worked for Assurant for 21 years until I got outsourced. Assurant changed alot over the 21 years. It went from a private company to a public company.
bad,"Assurant is the most poorly run company I've ever been a part of and the customer service reps pay the price, with angry customers (call after call). It could be a great place to work with a few obvious changes but the upper management isn't interested. As a Customer Service Rep you want to help people with their concerns. Unfortunately, you can't help them because the hoops Assurant makes them jump through in the customers time of need. They hold their money and look for any reason not pay them after these peoples homes have been destroyed. Call after call the customer service rep is left to try to come up with another reason why the customer still can't get their money to repair their home. Everyday you'll have people crying and angry because they need their home repaired and they've called many times to get the money but the check still hasn't been issued. They try to escalate the call but no one in management will take the call. I've personally had many callers who refused to get off the phone and stayed on 2-3 hours with me trying to get someone in management to take the call. I know you need a job but just know I warned you."
bad,I do not have any thing good to say about Assurant specialty insurance company. I love the job I perform but the atmosphere and the management is horrible. you will never get a raise only if you get promotions I think. But the job is rewarding because you help people
bad,"Used to be a great workplace when I first started.  Then changes happened frequently...never had the same manager for more than 4 months, benefits are trash, advancement is hard to come by."
bad,It was very stressful
bad,"An okay place to work if you want to stressed with high production requirements. Managers do not have basic job experience. They require more from their employees but they can not do the work they require from you,"
bad,"Very stressful place to work.  You get paid for OT hours. The last several years in the Renters team was very stressful, many people left due to the stress."
bad,"- pour training "
bad,"The companies systems are out of date and prevent staff from being able to do a good. The company don't look forward and follow process that are out of date and not fit for purpose, they don't like change or people asking to review processes. Its a shame as there are some good people there."
bad,"Assurant as a company isn't the issue, this particular office is. Schedules change without notice and you can either take it or quit. you will be forced to take on multiple clients without proper training yet you are still held accountable for any mistakes made. Management is not knowledgeable of  the policies and procedures."
bad,"If you are all about change and respecting your workforce, do not work for Assurant. They do not care about the little person, just do more work. It is not right and I stood up for myself and my team and here we are."
bad,"When you are hired and during your first day and training period, you are fed a massive load of complete bs about how wonderful and fun the company is. You are showered with swag. But once you get into nesting and onto the floor, you come to find out that supervisors and HR are completely heartless and the customers are the scum of the world. Mandatory overtime is extremely common. You will be required to work 6 days a week and threatened with 7 days a week. Your calls are scrutinized and you can never live up to their expectations. The customers are the worst. Expect to be screamed at, cussed at, belittled, and generally made to be a verbal punching bag and door mat. The work sucks, the environment sucks, the management sucks."
bad,"Assurant has ""core values""...which are only followed when supervisors need a reason to let people go."
bad,"They micromanage and try to get people to resign so they don't have to pay unemployment. Just laid off about 200 people in Lawton, OK. Extremely high turn over rate. Really never heard an employee say anything positive about their jobs. Management lied. Didn't learn anything."
bad,"Managers show Major Favortism, if they  Don't like you they will retaliate on you big time. High Senority employees jumping ship. You need to kiss up to be promoted."
bad,"Management suck and show favoritism in certain situations!! Layoffs are out of this world as of now,!! I wasted 10+ years of my life there and now getting laided off!!!"
bad,"The job is okay, people are way nastier over the phone than in person. There is little to no advancement, and mainly if you are bilingual. If you want to move up, better start brown nosing people."
bad,"Couldn't stay a minute longer. The weight of the training material, coupled with an inattentive, biased trainer, extreme stress on metrics and the lack of a family-oriented atmosphere made it impossible to stay. The training was poorly executed: there were no dummy environments or accounts. Excessive cramming required for exams. Monstrously ineffective training given by an impatient, short tempered trainer who repeatedly interrupted class by running out on her phone."
bad,"Having worked in this company for 5 years I can safely say I have never worked for such a clicky management team. If your face doesn't fit you may aswell walk away."
bad,Management doesn’t do anything to help. They just sit behind a desk and hold conversations with employees about movies and other non work related things. Wasting time and not helping those that actually need them. There’s too much drama amongst employees and you’re never sure if your job is safe at the rate they lose contracts and run out of work. Training is lacking and there is a LOT of theft going unnoticed even with the metal detectors.
bad,This job sucks. They want you to work extreme overtime.... they dont care if you Have family at home... . They hire young pretty  girls  or who they like..    they will only make ways for you if they like you..... they have no structural management...... they have too many  people trying to lead with the ones who are following are lost cause all leadership is leading in different directions..... i would not recommend this job to anyone. The company dont care about you if you are a temp especially..... it is a highly stressful environment.... the job is easy but the fact that it has no structural management makes it hard. They dont pay enough for the stress.
bad,"See ratings. It's a shame it's as bad as it is. It had the potential, but there is not the will from the leadership to make it a great place to work. ."
bad,"Poor management. Excess work hours required for salaried employees. Favoritism rather than accomplishments for progressions, minimal recognition for goals completed within limitations."
bad,"After the first couple of years the company started cutting benefits and degrading the working environment and the last couple of years it's sunk fast, with layoffs and pay freezes and the immortal ""Do more with less!"" mantra."
bad,"This company is filled with lazy, racist managers. Who thinks it's completely normal to say and do whatever they please to their employees. All -n- all I would not recommend this company to anyone."
bad,"Only speaking for IT, there is a mixed bag of skills and leadership.  Advancement opportunities are restricted to two core locations regardless of your skills and execution."
bad,Terrible place to work. Basically it's a sweat shop with a high school mentality that is overly micromanaged with sometimes very unrealistic expectations.
bad,Micromanaged. Whoever tells first keeps their job. Great money and plenty of over time. Upper management is great. day-to-day management need better training on how to deal with people. HR policy needs to be updated.
bad,This company is no longer in business due to the devastating ACA regulations that forced the company out of business. Most people were terrmintated and a few absorbed into other divisions.
bad,"Place is like a jail, you have have permission to get a drink of water at the fountain or use the restroom and when you do they time you. No compassion to their employees when there is a loss in the employees family and write you up for attending the funeral since not planned . Management is a joke, and his experience is less then his employees. Worst job I ever had !!!!"
bad,"The money and benefits weren't worth the mental abuse we took daily.  Management was awful.  They never promoted anyone who deserved it.  I did work with a lot of great people, but not for long.  Turnover is high, and we lost a lot of intelligent employees.  Once I started losing my teammates, I knew it was time to go, too."
bad,"I have learned a lot from working here, but the one major downside is the difficulty to progress anywhere within the company."
bad,"Asked to do way to much work that one can handle, High stress, always told every little thing you do wrong and written down on your record which affects raise, rarely praised for the hard work you put in, poor raises, unqualified management, no advancement."
bad,"The work enviroment was like being back in high school. However, I met people there that I still talk to since I left the company. They were then as they are today; beautiful friends and a wonderful resource of encouragement. Working there was like being on a realty TV show. I'm not sure what was harder to deal with, the irate homeowners or the child like non-sense that was allowed to go on by management. A person could NEVER show any initiative because management would either steal your ideas or stifle you to the point where you didn't even want to try. And don't even get me started on the mandatory overtime!! I like my family and love spending time with them, again another thing that managment knew nothing about! "
bad,"This place business in Addison,Tx is horrific. The pay is good but for the work they have you do you should be paid way more. If you get fired they lie to unemployment so that you dont get any unemployment. Majority of the supervisor are not there to help you, they are there to help themselves look good so that they keep there job."
bad,"Assurant started ok at first, but after a few years I never made any more money and was just left with low pay and increased responsibilities with no incentives. The hardest workers are way underpaid due to some sort of wage system while management that do nothing are paid much more for thier title. There are several other companies in the area that pay better."
bad,"Great company to work for and executive management is awesome.  Lots of animosity amongst team members and acting supervisor does not instill success, encouragement or motivation."
bad,"Good pay, good benefits just do not look to advance but so much."
bad,"No enough Minority opportunity . They did inclusión hiring at the top level /board and hired all white woman  . They secretly share job ops between a select few / friends . Outsourcing departments over seas cutting minority jobs first . "
bad,Micromanaging intimidation if they dont like you and your not blowing them then you wont make it favoritism makes a very toxic enviroment do yourself a favor and run run far away your stress levels will thank me
bad,"This company has no Mission statement or Strategy. Management  and H.R is the bottleneck. Ethical comitee violates all ethical boundries. No internal job promotions...ever Eventhough you are more than qualified. Accounting Department is the worst out of all ,,,,So does the premium accounting department."
bad,Your just another body there to answer phones it depends on if you want to have people yell at you over the phone trying to help them or not not for everyone.
bad,Disorganized and shady practices. Management does not know what is going on within the team. Working from home feels like a huge disconnect from the rest of the organization.
bad,"I could go on and on about how horrible this place became. It started out pretty good. The management when I initially started, was pretty good. They were responsive to the employees and took care of us. As time went on and volume increased, management began to make changes that essentially turned this place into a plantation. The culture between management and the employees became adversarial. Horrible job."
bad,"A lot of guy in a cube farm. Very noisy and hard to hear in the call center, very hard to do your job. Management would oplay the ""hard rock music loud"", This was a call center of about 50 people, very hard to work on the phones"
bad,This is the worst job I've ever had.  Impossible work load.  My manager was a tyrant.   Had to wait 3 months to receive cat pay.  Cat pay was less than half of what other insurance companies pay.
bad,Worst job I have ever had. Management is okay - some are better than most. Environment feels stifled. EVERYTHING that you do is watched - you are even timed when going to the bathroom. Low employee morale.
bad,This place is a dead end call center job. Managers play favorites.. no room for advancement.. and they grill you  for kpis don't waste your time working for this company if you have a degree
bad,never knowing if the job were going to end. management at Assurant does not let temp service or employees know what to expect if it is just for a week or for a life time. always guessing.
bad,Working in this company has been wonderful experience because I've learned how to do multi tasking and communicate with different customers in USA.
bad,I really enjoyed everyone that I worked with but just thought that they could've done more to make our jobs easier by approving more websites for us to access to get the insurance information. There were also a lot of automative systems that we could call before companies are opened to be able to meet our 64 calls per day and having incoming calls which sometimes last 10 to 15 mins really made this very difficult to meet daily. I liked how they gave award and fake money to purchase snacks from the store but a lot of times the store wasn't opened after awhile. It seems like they start these incentives but never stick with them.
bad,Management sucks and give unrealistic goals!!!!  Seven calls are monitored each month.  Management expects you to be perfect and no one is perfect.  I averaged 95 percent and it still was not good enough.
bad,"my time for the few months that I had worked with Assurant Speciality Property was one of an ill-feeling. I have a retail background and am very comfortable with helping people and customer service in general. However, I had never worked in a call center before, which management and others were aware of. I felt as though I was singled out by the team leads and ""manager."" My co-workers were good people, however I was never at any point comfortable with working there with the ""big brother"" over the should mentality that you have in a  call center. Having never worked in a call center before and there being specific regulations and guidelines for how to talk on the phone, it did not allow me to be TRULEY customer oriented."
bad,"The management is terrible, you correspond via instant message and have to wait for ten minutes or more until a supervisor decides to reply and alot of times you have to correspond with several teams of management because others won't even acknowledge you, especially if they don't ""like"" you. The company is unorganized, many times it takes unnecessary time to finally locate someone with the answer, only to be told to have the customer call back or they will call them. Alot of times it was issues a customer service rep could've handled, had the superior took the time to review the notes and make a decision, as opposed to having the consumer very unhappy for them to be on hold for excessive amounts of time and then be told to call back, or info they already know. The customer service team is awesome and many times we tried to go above and beyond, but if it's out of our authority we have to ""wait"" until the person who can make that call, decides to advise us how to handle the situation. The only plus side is the pay is ok and the benefits are competitive, but i'm sure because the company knows what you have to put up with, the sad thing is it's not the consumers it's the members of management that abuse their authority!!! It's such a closed in setting, everyone gossips and tells other employee's business, i've never worked at such a messy place.Kind of hard to address any issues or concerns you may have, if the issue is with your superior and their ""buddies"" with their superior, your issue is than kind of brushed under the rug. I'm glad to have learned about the insurance industry,"
bad,"Senior managment has lost touch with it's employees."
bad,"A typical day at Assurant would be exciting in solving problems, getting to the root of the problems, I learned that teamwork is the best way to get the job done effectively. My co-workers were great, it was like a family affair. The hardest part of the job, was to leave the office in a timely matter, that's because once we get started on a project, it was really hard to leave and not complete the projects, the most enjoyable part of the job was the friendliness of my peers."
bad,I would never work for this company again. I invested years in the company and nothing to show for it due to lay of and relocation
bad,Very stressful! Very micro managed! Control your time! It is virtually impossible to take care of personal obligations if you work there! My qualifications were way more than others and I was an by the hour temp. I felt like a slave being paid minimum. If the racial amount of employees were reversed there would be a lawsuit! I could accomplish nothing in my life but work there. When I was sick they never once offered to wanting me to leave or go home! A very bad spirit is there toward employees. I hate the place!
bad,"My team lead was more interested in being friends with certain coworkers and created very stressful work environment.  Upper management never discipline team lead due to his personal relationship with another supervisor."
bad,"I hated working at Assurant. When it came down to it, they didn't care about your life outside of Assurant. As long as you were making them money that's all that seemed to matter. I had a three month old child in the hospital with Pneumonia and they basically told me if I called in to be with my child I was fired."
bad,It all sounds great in the beginning but once out of training that is when the BS starts. Training doesn't prepare you at all for the floor life. No floor support at all. group chats that are supposed to be helpful are a joke. The homeowners talk to you all crazy and we are supposed to accept it. No real work life balance. I needed to change my schedule due to family changes and I have been waiting for 3 months. Managers are constantly gossiping. I would never recommend it here. Maybe for another client but not mine.
bad,I have never worked for a warehouse before this but I would not recommend this pace to work I developed anxiety from this job. I have never seen or heard of a more unorganized place. Supervisors not even sure how to do the job of their employees below them.
bad,"Do not care about employees at all. emotional abuse and strong arm, do not ask questions they will fire you."
bad,The only way anyone would enjoy working for this company is if they have never worked in corporate america before. Management skills were poor. Quality was an absolute joke and last minute break changes were ridiculous. You could never plan to do anything on your lunch break because 4 out of the 5 days you worked your break was changed from an hour to 30 minutes due to call volume. Management did not believe in coaching and development. They would just put you down if you didn't do the job they expected without proper training.`
bad,"Do not work for this company in the Duluth, GA location. It is full of folks that don't need to be there and have no concept of what quality customer service is about. They only want you to use certain phrases which are most of the time inappropriate for the caller's situation. But, if you don't use the phrases, your quality score is at the bottom."
bad,"I was at Assurant for 26 years. I learned about the mortgage documents, inspection process, learned good customer service skills, assisted homeowner's with process of there property claim. I feel it use to be a good company to work for. The hardest part and dislike of this job is being moved around a lot to different positions due to business needs and most of the manager's I have had while there showed favoritism . Eight months ago I was moved to my final department and after a short time because I wasn't producing the 13 an hour was put on action plan and was terminated after 26 years and was told this should have been done previously by other managers. My quality of work was high 90's to 100%."
bad,This has to be my second time interviewing with them. Overall I did great on both interviews otherwise they wouldn’t have taken me to listen to calls. It’s been weeks and I haven’t heard anything back from them as of yet. Never considering working for this employer ever again my second and last time applying here.
bad,Not a positive experience with this  employer. Company decided to move back to Springfield and employees were required to relocate back to that Springfield office.
bad,"I worked 2nd shift. And you would leave each day mentally exhausted and tired, they are so lost in favoritism and drama.                                      "
bad,Have worked here for five years and am currently seeking other employment opportunities. Strict dress code but great benefits
bad,"If you choose to work here, dont work in the warranty dept. You will never advance in your position. Lots of favoritism..Over all not a great place to work."
bad,I think that everyone should work in the call center and they will learn a lot of things that will help them out at Assurantas well as any other job
bad,"some good day,s and bad day,s I learned some Arabic working at the Saudi embassy management okay co-worker,s fine aggrevasion best part of day leaving"
bad,"If you have tough skin then working here is the place for you."
bad,"I do not recommend working at Assurant in Duluth. It is very stressful and has a huge turnover. They admitted to me that following their unreasonable rules was more important than pleasing the customer. In other words, they don't care if you please/help the customer. Their QA process is completely subjective and totally unfair. I had a good schedule and enjoyed my co-workers but way too much pressure and stress. Not worth it."
bad,"The managers dont care. The staff dont care and the customers talk to you like you're dirt on their shoe. "
bad,"This is a fast paced call center where you only get 7 seconds between calls. In this 7 seconds you have to enter notes regarding the call and what the customer said. There is a script you must follow and if you deviate at all YOU WILL GET WRITTEN UP. Your schedule MUST be adhered to down to the minute or YOU WILL GET WRITTEN UP! This means if your break is scheduled from 10:00-10:15, and you are on a call with a customer, you will get written up for not leaving on time, and not returning on time (Because you have to legally take your 15   minutes)"
bad,"The owners of this company let greed take over and because of this, the company closed it's doors leaving over 1500 employees without a job. it was fun while it lasted."
bad,": Sales automation deals with the Inventory & Material management, Order Processing and print schedules. The front-end provides user-friendly interfaces, Invoice report generation and Pending Order processing information. Inventory system covers the processes of raising requirement, calling for quotations, processing quotations, plac"
bad,"The company itself and management is very disorganized.  The whole time I was there I didn't  have access  to my pc/workstation because  login information  was not provided even after the two  weeks of training. There is no job security. The company does  the majority  of their  hiring through temp agencies. They could  let you go at anytime. In my situation I worked  a month and then was ""laid off"" due  to ""work  slowing down"".  Stay away  from this company. Yet, if you do get hired and they start asking you to volunteer days or time off that is a sign that  a lay off is coming soon."
bad,Everything I was sold in the interview was a lie!  Biggest mistake of my career!  I am so much happier now that I have left the company!  Good luck to those who choose to stay!
bad,I enjoyed working for Assurant Specialty Property. I learn how the mortgage insurance works.
bad,If you live in Nashville or suddenly find yourself moving to Nashville and need a quick job that you have no plans on staying with this is the perfect call center for you.
bad,This is a very stressful place to work. Each day in and out is the same exact thing. It's not challenging. The environment is that of a high school. Co-workers often gossip and cause drama. The most enjoyable part of the job is when I'm clocking out to leave.
bad,"It was really a Challenging environment on daily work basis, I have learnt how tackle the things effectively and efficiently."
bad,"Do not apply at this company unless you are very desperate for a job.  Please note that the position you are hired for, will NOT be the position you actually end up working when you start.  This company is stingy with raises and advancements, so they end up putting as much work on a single associate as possible to keep costs down.  This is perhaps the most unprofessional place I have ever worked in my entire life.  Strokes, high blood-pressure, miscarriages are common within this job.  Avoid at all costs!"
bad,good place to work and with alot opportunity to improve and grow.They are great opportunities for learning and growth. Fast pase and alot of challenge for the
bad,"Very easy job, Enjoyed what I did. Always got the job did. Reached my quota. Many different jobs in one company. Very big successful company. Fun work place!"
bad,"Ok place to work, wasnt really my type of work, I like to be on my feet and up and down where this job was sitting all day."
bad,Pay attention to what your learning. You will become very skillful.  And just do your work and mind your business. Take advantage of learning everything you can.
bad,"This place pays 12.50 an hour in the DFW area, most places pay at least 15.00 an hour. There are physical altercations on the floor, and the benefits are expensive. It's a good place to work if your looking for another job. Even during the other parts of the business the pay is not comparable to other companies."
bad,"I worked for this company for 9+ years and every time I tried to elevate within the company or move to a new position or area, I was met with opposition. However, the company regularly practiced moving myself and others to whatever position they saw fit whenever they saw fit, with no training . Regular management changes made it difficult to work in peace when having to adjust to different management styles on a consistent basis."
bad,"Straight from the get go, too much was expected from new employees. Toilet breaks were capped to incredibly small time frames of 5 minutes. breaks were too short to even get to the canteen and back."
bad,"This companies work environment was stressful. The production is very high, and the management was not kind or pleasant to work for. Will never work in this type of environment again.This company is very micromanaged by management. Left  this company on good terms, but would not recommend working there."
bad,"The management in the Springfield Ohio office is uneducated and promoted based on friendship. It's who you know here now what you do. It is common that the underlings will have to train and show the new managers and then are told they are not ready to move up. Nearly ALL the managers in office have never taken a call, did the job the people are doing under them and have no basic understanding of the system used. Team leads are used as buffers to the mangers, they're paid less but know more and did the job prior, however are underpaid and over worked. "
bad,I guess for an individual that wants to sit in a building w/o light and deal with people screaming at them all day with very little chance of promotion it would be a wonderful job.
bad,Not impressed by management on any level..company is very unorganized and unprofessional...department is behind in technology and is slow to address issues
bad,"Okay job for entry level, not a job for a career. No advancement or progression with company. Pay is very low and management is not professional."
bad,"Management plays the favorite card oh to well. If you weren't one to suck up then you were 1s to be notice and sorted out on any and all things to get rid of you no matter how hard working or dedicated you are. "
bad,This is a job if your looking to just get by. I did not enjoy going to work. The pay is low and management treats employees fairly. Difficult to advance unless you test out for a better position during interview.
bad,The management at Assurant is unreliable and inconsistent. A typical day at work would consist of 25-60 calls. You were scored based on calls unjustly. The hardest part of the job was assisting customers who requested a manager and supervisor and none willing to take the call. This caused the customers to be extremely frustrated and the atmosphere of the office was very tense and stressful.
bad,I would not recommend Assurant to anyone they are so unprofessional and unorganized. The training is a joke! You have to basically teach yourself. They are experiencing a lot of changes with management so a lot a snake like activity is occurring because everyone is trying  to get a position of higher power. It’s a call center so it’s very messy. If you are not a butt kisser you will not make it here.
bad,10 years with company no advancement leads and managers sleeping together to hold positions. Everyone covering to protect friends just not a good company. Company needs to look at the turn around rate and how all the people that have been there long term are just walking away. Stress Stress Stress. Run away quickly
bad,The IT group is a little confused.  Rolls down hill. PMs are cattle so were not treated very well.  The business side has had little interaction with IT so they do not understand culture differences.
bad,Didn't feel respected by the company. Employee's were treated as replaceable drones. Management was not at all Informed on the everyday function of the day until after the workday started
bad,"I can't believe I lasted as long as I did there, to be quite honest. Management was a total disaster in every way imaginable. There was nothing compelling about the job or the company, and as time went on and I saw some of their practices particularly with Assurant Health, I just felt disgusted working there. I was relieved when I found an opportunity to move on."
bad,"Work too many hours, below average pay, no benefits, no sick pay in first year, no pay rises allowed in first year not appriciated."
bad,"Production-driven job but it's difficult to make production (KPI's) and retain 99% quality score on a monthly basis. Stay away from hazard processing  and customer care and you may have more advancement opportunity. Mandatory overtime but management calls  calls it ""highly suggested""."
bad,Work good shifts. I have worked there for years and held 90-100% QA and yet still no advancement. Managers do not tend to keep up with their monthly reviews on work. Environment is hectic and chaotic. Will be seeking other employment in order to gain advancement and better benefits for self and family.
bad,"this company has ok benefits for perm employees, but if you come in as a temp. your are treated poorly. you are held to the same standards as a perm employeed but never recognized for been a good employee. you are discriminated as a temp"
bad,"Do not work for this company. Misleading customers on what they are buying through carefully worded scripts that meet compliance, but do not educate customers on what they are actually purchasing. Lots of turnover. Poor work environment. Supervisors are cruel and unwelcoming."
bad,"Not to the PAR, Managements needs a proper Leadership skills to lead  the team. No Acknowledgement of your efforts.  If you can't trust your employees then why hire them at first place"
bad,Working for the Speciality service department is great when you are first hired but you will soon see if you are not favoured you will be treated as such.
bad,"An awful lot of clicks. The culture is very separated, Its all about who you know, not how good you are at what you do. Managers protect certain employees. It appear cronyism happens."
bad,"This company may pay well but they do not treat employees fairly. There is no social life working here as you're expected to work most evenings and weekends."
bad,Above average place to work if you are in the industry. Work life balance depends on role and leadership. Some great people work there and I am optimistic about the continued growth of the company.
bad,No job security for software developers.  Quickly replaceable by someone in India.  Upper management only care about cost cutting.  Met really nice people.
bad,The job overall is not hard.  The way employees breaks are schedule poorly predetermined by workforce management.  Temporary employees are disposal throughout the company.
bad,Would not refer anyone to this job at all the positions aren't good or the hours lunche are too short I feel like the team leads could help more instead of being on their phones and management really doesn't know their job some don't not all.
bad,"The employees at Assurant Field Asset Services were some of the sharpest I have ever worked with - management however, was not aware of their employees' bandwidth and would often overwork, underpay, and underappreciate them in day to day operations."
bad,Management is not experienced and lack of education. I have trained several employees due to my many years of experience. Co-workers are great. There is no hard part to my job. I came to Assurant to train employees and to help start a new client.
bad,"Company doesn't make me feel secure in any aspect. There is no advancement, multiple lay offs in a 6 month period and a huge lack of proper training. Management does not include lower employees on happens in company. I feel that it is a dead end job. I enjoyed this position when I first started, I felt like I could really get somewhere. But I wasn't aware of how things were actually ran."
bad,Its good for a first job. Bad pay for very strenuous work. The managers were nice though.
bad,"A typical day commences of rushing to the call center floor because parking is far and always full. You take calls all day. The work is not hard just tedious with no room for creativity. I have mastered everything there is to know about inbound CSR. I have learned to advance in the company you have to be well connected within the company and not by performance. Co-workers were the best people you could sit next to at any job. The hardest part of the job was knowing you were getting paid a lot less than other people who were doing the same job as you. Also, another difficult part of the job is when you are hurt and cannot work there is little chance of receiving STD benefits. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing I was receiving a check at the end of the day."
bad,From this experience I would never work at another call center. If your a temp you have no chance at all.
bad,"Review various types of insurance documents and update the hazard insurance lines on the clients’ servicing systems according to established procedures. Verifies that the policy contains acceptable coverage and disburse premium payments from the escrow account if required; make necessary outbound phone calls to insurance agents, and companies to update insurance policies and obtain needed (missing) information. Perform maintenance as necessary for policy changes, letters, notices, etc. Insure all items are processed in a timely manner to meet or exceed established standards.."
bad,A typical day at Assurant as a Claims/Customer Service Rep it conducts of a high volume of inbound calls from our insureds requesting to file a claim and/or check the status of an existing claim. I've learned more about the line of business of the Insurance field for Property and Casulty. The hardest part of my job was the lack of communication between the Claims reps and Adjusters. The most enjoyable part of the business is assisting the insureds.
bad,"Easy role but poor management, feel like a number not a person, next to no way to progress unless you suck up big time and kiss the a** of a manager "
bad,"The interviewing and hiring process is fairly easy. Training was fairly easy as well. Management and HR however are not helpful or seem to know solutions to employee's problems. I personally did not get paid on one occasion until the next pay period. Management and HR could not locate my pay, or explain why it had not been received. I was not offered a solution or alternative. I was told to check the mail everyday, and told a replacement check was sent overnight on two different occasions and nothing was received. Very frustrating place to work in when management is of no assistance to you."
bad,non professional environment.  would not suggest working for this company.  non business professional people working for them.  management non existent.
bad,"poor management. never knew where you stood with your job.  manager infrequent with evaluations "
bad,The company is on a downward financial spiral; their lender-placed business is dwindling and they need to find a new market niche. They recently laid off many adjusters and re-organized some management.
bad,"Assurant has a good market presence in the insurance industry. However, I found the culture to be very cutthroat and toxic. This is a 'who you know' culture. If you know the right people then you can advance. Advancement in the company is not based on your performance, dedication, or integrity."
bad,No work life balance.  Cancels vacations and planned holidays regularly over 4 months. Worked min of 8 hours a day 7 days a week for 4 months.  Claim to be Agile but do not value people.
bad,The management is changing and they are clueless about their roles and the roles of subordinates. Professionalism is out the door and hiring friends is a part of some of their priorities.
bad,Assurant is a very fast paced work area. The managers are not all that friendly. They have their favorites and don't treat everyone equally. Their expectancy for phones per night is outrageously high.
bad,There were no advancement opportunities and the pay was not comparable to similar positions at other companies.  Management did not work towards employee development or growth.  Micro-managing became the norm when profits were higher priority than employee and client satisfaction.
bad,"Very inconsistent with procedures, training, performance management, and advancement.  Very clickish.  The leadership team operates by intimidation.  Many managers are unhappy and seeking other employment."
bad,poor management means poor work environment. its sad when you know more than your manager and said manager has no desire to learn how their team operates. no trust among employer and employee. boss is quick to throw you under the bus and take your ideas when they are good. just all around bad.
bad,"Very laid back atmosphere however felt like I was in high school.  Between clique type behavior and Manager overlooking important things.  Management lacks training in areas of leadership, diversity and respect.  Manager tends to blur the lines of management role and being friends with fellow employees.  Great opportunity to obtain a adjuster license."
bad,I have enjoyed working for the company however progression is limited and the work is repetitive. You must stand out from the crowd to get noticed. The company has improved the benefits you receive recently. Customer service is a good role and secure job.
bad,Put in data from cell phone. Management is strict. If you receive a Sim Card in a phone you will be written up then another you are out the door. Security is strict cant wear hoodies or boots and no jacket or coats
bad,"The managers micromanage and encourage an environment of competition with your coworkers, but do not provide proper incentive to actually compete. The pay isn't remotely competitive, there are no opportunities for advancement (unless you wish to manage), and the existing managers have no idea what they are doing. You are required to take verbal abuse from customers and have no means of addressing grievances. You are just a warm body in a headset."
bad,"Customer Service Rep for 6 years and Processing Team lead for 5 years, helped manage a team when there was no manager great teams but there could be much better leadership."
bad,"The work atmosphere is very regimented. You take your breaks and lunch (30min) with everyone else at a set time. You have to remain quiet throughout the day, being social is not encouraged. However the latest pop hits are continually beamed from the loudspeakers, and although its not very loud, it is distracting to hear the same songs over and over again about once every hour. The training process consists of someone sitting over your shoulder watching you work ALL DAY, every day pointing out errors, which makes it harder to concentrate. This goes on for months. It's not at all a friendly environment, very strict with little to no interaction with coworkers. Most just stare at their screens with a scowl on their face most times anyway."
bad,"If you absolutely have no other options then this is a great company. Management, communication and compensation is poor. Nothing good here unless you are just starting your career and need some resume padding"
bad,This was a great place to work until inexperienced managers made changes that killed morale and reduced productivity.
bad,The company is okay to work for at the very start of your career.  Company should be used as a stepping stone or a filler for in between jobs.
bad,"Assurant is a fortune 500 company, but based on the lack of job security,  lack of communication and the pay, you wouldn't think it's a fortune 500 company. The pay is mediocre, your schedule can change at given time and definitely no opportunity to truly advance. Not a career, but definitely a job. High turnover rate. A lot of employees are afraid to give rebuttals on certain issues because Georgia is an ""at will"" state. Employees are advised in the middle of the year of schedule changes ranging from 9am to 9pm and are advised if you can't work a particular schedule then seek employment elsewhere. The company will move you to another department without any advance notice, require you to take on additional job responsibilities, but no extra pay!!! This is not how a true fortune 500 company treat its employees."
bad,Very hard not to fall asleep there lol. Just wasn't for me. I admire those people who can actually stay awake there and do that on a daily basis.
bad,Company is ok to work. Need work life balance and stability with management and better compensation.  Work days could flow over to you family life if not careful. But they offer flexibility as far as working from home.  I don't know how long this opportunity will continues.
bad,"-Rigueur dans le Travail"
bad,"I've seen it all. From multi-million dollar lawsuits being paid, office  politics, and favortism, Assurant Health has gone down the drain, and now ultimately closing up for good. I've made lifelong friendships over the years and I am thankful, but will not shed a tear once the doors lock.  Management was less than stellar and some had no clue of how to be a supervisor or manager. Then, to know that they were exiting the health insurance market and still hiring people who left their jobs, is less than professional. I knew a couple of people who thought they had something secure at Assurant Health, only to be told months later that they were needed."
bad,"Management can never be found. Nobody likes to take accountability. Policies are constantly being changed and not communicated to the customer service reps. People get promotions through people they know, not because they have earned it. Overall it is a very negative and chaotic environment."
bad,I believe it is important to have great work life balance. The job does not offer that and the benefits are not great neither is the pay
bad,"You come in 8am Log into your phone wear your headseet, begin assigned work with documents, calls follow ups, callouts etc all while taking inbound calls as well. At this time I have been through a Temp service for 1yr so dis satisfied per no Benifits, and lower pay. Regular Assurant employees like the benifits except they do say to get good coverage you pay ALOT. The environment is ok, however some days like going into A BAD highschool experience but that is due to alot of people you work with. The management is OK nice, respectful and professional most the time. Right now we are WAY behind and our Client they do not want to hire on FT any the Temp workers and we have lost alot of people. High turn over here. I have learned process and procedures for Home owners INS claims. I have learned how to use various Computer tools. Overall a good learning experience for future jobs. Unfortunatly also many FT reg assurant employees have been here OVER a year with NO advancement so that does not seem promising for many people employeed here."
bad,"Management is the main issue here. There are several systemic issues in how the departments are run, but when employees try to bring them to management’s attention, they are told that they are non-issues."
bad,"Worked for Assurant for a few months before i grew tired of the place, management are clicky and if you face dont fit you may aswell not even bother, work colleagues were the only thing that really made a work day half enjoyable, customers spoke to you like trash constantly, and overall you just looked forward to getting home, would not work there again, unrealistic call targets especially with the scripts you had to read to the customers before they could even speak, it would make you sound robotic and management would then comment on how you sound to robotic despite reading off the scripts THEY PROVIDE, honestly this job just makes your life miserable, avoid"
bad,Not a good company to work for. Management is very unprofessional and not encouraging. It could be a good place to work if they put more qualified and professional managers and team leads in postions.
bad,I learned what it means to answer the phone and give quality customer service to a person who is stressed out  and just trying to make the call end. I learned how great it feels to make a customer's day. I also learned it's okay to ask coworkers for help from time to time.
bad,"Coming in to the company I was very optimistic and worked hard to become a tenured senior employee. Although the company changes continuously, the security of having the position long term is not guaranteed. The opportunity for advancement is more of who you know and not work ethics. This is just something to pay bills until you find another company that invest in their employees and value their tenured employees."
bad,"If interested in a job and not a career this is the place to work, or at least until major contracts cancel, which will be inevitable. Then there will be no jobs. There is no accountability for performance. Attendance, reliability,  performance and  just meeting your metrics are not that important at least in customer care. It is a culture of ""everyone for themselves"". We literally have Unit Managers that will set their own hours, surf the internet, text on their cell phones all day, and other managers have to assist the staff they are supposed to manage. Operations Managers will praise these individuals. As managers, front line members who decide to arrive late or not show up for there shift, will not be held accountable; in fact, will be offered a more convenient shift assignment. Assurant has gone through some restructuring recently and new senior management. The promise that this would change; however, it has not, and it appears that it will not. Same dance but a different song."
bad,When I first joined the company was fair but then a year later they started to do re-org and things got changed quite a lot. An outsider got in to 'make the change' and many people's job got affected. I then decided to leave due to much uncertainty and lost of focus and teamwork. It was just very unfortunate.
bad,"I would have learned more to be better at handling angry customers if continuous training was provided, instead we got a weekly one on one meeting with the supervisor to discuss and listen to all the bad handled calls we got.  EX: you sounded too cold, you didn't acknowledge the dog barking, you didn't sound empathetic...etc.  Who likes to listen to his/her own voice? this continuous criticism wears you out by the end of the month.  There is no fresh air everyone breathes the same germs and no one cares. And my favorite line by my supervisor ""well then this may not be the right place for you"" Yes I quit."
bad,Assurant is overrun with bullies in leadership and yes men in middle management.  Horrible place to work for thinkers and technology practitioners.  You will be amazed at how backward this company is.  It is a wonder they are still in business.
bad,Good Place to work just not up to speed and still has the good old boys club in charge.  Too many long term old processes along with too many old school people.  Other than that ok!
bad,"Management doesn't tell employees about what is happening in the company. Everything is through word of mouth from fellow employees and usually management ignores the problems and never comes clean about anything until there is no other option. "
bad,"The job entailed taking calls from customers regarding warranties on white goods."
bad,"Enjoyed the people and the job. Was given the opportunity to learn much and put it to use, however it's a dead-end job as far as promotions and low pay due to demographics."
bad,"If you need a job fast, if this is your first full-time job, if you're looking for a low-stress job until you get a degree, or if you really like being on the phone, this is an ok job. However, the pay is terrible and the raises are practically non-existent. Depending on the department you work in, you may be timed on how long you take to go to the bathroom. Some people like it, but I just want to get my degree and get out of here."
bad,I would not work here again.  It's a great job if you are in need and are trying to get back on your feet and looking for other work.  It's not a long term option.
bad,"Your work schedule will mostly be awful at first, but enough people will quit or be fired within the first year, that you'll get bumped to a proper shift."
bad,"I have been bounced around from department to department. I feel like I am all over the place. I have had 7 different managers in 2 years. I like some of my job functions, because I know what they are and some days I feel as if my internal compass is off. Overall, if management was stable, it would be a great place. For the past 2 years I have experienced nothing but movement."
bad,"Worked in the call center in Plymouth, MN for five years. Let me offer a few facts... my pay has been cut/ capped three times, but the CEO has doubled his pay in last three years.  You will be treated as a number and have no other value. There is no room for advancement.  Keep looking you can do better!"
bad,"Assurant is a place with great potential for individuals who seek to be with a company doing the same position until they either retire, get fired, or find something better. I worked side by side with some of the professional & most hardworking insurance representatives there are in the state of Georgia. I loved the fact that we were not sales agents but actual phone reps providing people with help. The hardest part of the job I consider is the way managements contradicts their own rules constantly while blaming everything & refusing to take responsibility for many crucial things that are wrong. Furthermore, it is very disappointing to find out after a while that the only way to move up on the company is to disguise great ideas on things that are screaming for improvement or to become a supervisor's intimate friend. I can honestly say that the most enjoyable part of my job was translating to Spanish speaking people because I felt like I was useful & getting my paycheck because I felt like I worked myself hard to earn it. I learned at Assurant to rely on myself for everything, to keep my personal life with my work life in a perfect balance, & I also learned to not doubt myself or my abilities. Despite of any disagreements on how to provide excellent costumer care, I can honestly say that we are just moving in very different directions in life & as such I wish Assurant the best."
bad,Small call center which lacks guidance and clear direction from the center manager down.
bad,the managemnet strategies is diffrent with the diffrent directional motives.compensation are kind of low and sometimes coming to work and some elements try to micro-manage individuals.
bad,"My first year at the company was good, until they downside move me to another client, my boss was very was not very easy to work, health insurance was not good every time go to doctor next week you get bill. The commute was horrible, weather bad (snow or ice) you were. expected come to work."
bad,"Working here is divided by politics into 2 claims groups that are to be ""one team"" yet the other team gets far more perks, time in between calls, half the call volume, longer lunches. Then you have my team and it sure feels like they want us to sit at the back of the bus."
bad,"A great place at times, the work load steadily increased until it reaches critical mass and everybody is mandatory OT every day and request to come in during off days."
bad,I am currently looking for another job. I heard they are starting layoffs. I think people are no longer happy since they do not appreciate their workers and the pay is horrible and not enough money. We are paying more in insurance and taxes than any other company.
bad,I worked at Assurant for a little over a year and would not recommend this job to anyone unless they had no other options. The management is unprofessional and are more concerned with gossiping and hanging out with their favorite employees. You do so much work for the bare minimum pay and they are not concerned with actually helping these customers.
bad,"People come and people go in this place..revolving door in the front exit and back exit.  Great opportunity and a wonderful job start for those without a diploma or any job knowledge.  The wonderful management team at Assurant will designate someone to sit with you for 2 days and help train you. After 1 week you better learn your job ... before 90 days you may be out of a job.  Oh, and don't be late to work, 3 mins over is considered an occurrence.  The company love's giving out occurrences and warning you that you could lose your job."
bad,"There is a high volume of turnover  of agents and adjusters. Management  is very poor with little knowledge and generally unqualified  . Assurant handles  credit card benefits and has to meet a quota every month or they are fined by the card company. They basically  hire  entry level people for all positions with no experience just to accomplish  this. Therefore  management  coming in knows only as much as agents and adjusters. The only difference  between phone agents, adjusters and managers is pay. The workload is stressful and policy changes daily."
bad,"Working with brokers to develop worksite enrollment in territories across Texas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas.  Working to build enrollments with clients daily."
bad,"OK place, if you need a job.  Lousy physical environment,  poor infrastructure.  Not a friendly place to work.  No cubicles, just work benches.  .manager just watches out for himself, throws employees under the bus"
bad,"This company has routinely been at odds with regulators, and profits on foreclosure surges. Came under intense scrutiny in last market crash. I left after I was promised a promotion, told I was getting it, then three months later they took it back right before year end bonuses were due."
bad,"I went in a lot days in the beginning to learned and do it right way. After training, each day goes by threaten do any better in my work .I thought quality of my work is best at but how much quantity I was get out. I thought wrong. I had some help explaining from my co-workers  to do work like my boss . I found out even my co-workers try to get me fire too. Most enjoyable part was going home."
bad,"I take calls all day answering questions regarding their homeowners or rental insurance. Customers calling in making annually insurance payments on there wind, flood or hurricance."
bad,Very unbalanced place to work and management leaves employees feeling stressed and feeling unappreciated. As assistant supervisor I did my best to have the environment and culture of assurant change.
bad,"Assurant is very corporate and has so many HR protections in place you are safe from MANY small company issues. They have a procedure they follow for anything and everything. "
bad,Manager had no background as a manager and no educational history. She was just plan knowledgeless in training people as well as managing a unit of trained trainers.
bad,"Manned phones for customer service.  Some callers uncivil, and/or inappropriate.  Sales over communication and high sale pressure tactics created unhealthy atmosphere."
bad,"Managements only concern is meeting service level agreements and does not take any vested role with their analysts.  If you simply wish to do basic troubleshooting and book 10 hours a day 4 to 5 days a week and not continue learning or growing/advancing then this is a fine position.  The staff is run as lean as possible, so work is constant, but can be overwhelming if anyone calls out or takes PTO. Management has many meetings but little information is communicated down the chain and the department reacts constantly as opposed to plans and preempts errors or shortfalls."
bad,"Difficult place to work at if you have not worked assembly line type of work before. Its important to understand that the manufacturing plant is a part of the Insurance company.  Many of the policies are designed for a more professional office environment rather than a plant. "
bad,we were not properly trained on the material we had to work we were thrown on the floor with no system training. and we only maybe had 7calls a day  we really just sat there doing nothing
bad,"I worked for AFS for nearly 5 years.  Aside from being a job I could rely on going to every day, there were not many positives.  There is little to no opportunity for advancement, raises, promotion or recognition.  Upper management will not reward hard/reliable workers, nor discipline/fire lazy, unintelligent workers.  Employees are  treated not based on personal performance but on relationship status with upper management.  It is more important to be someone's ""buddy"" than to actually be capable at performing the functions of your position.  I would not recommend working here unless you really need a paycheck."
bad,they were not that flexible and the equipment they send isn't that reliable.. the supervisors are not all on the same page. the company isn't consistent with their policies
bad,The best part of the job was forming relationships with fellow employees.  Management didn't seem to understand the logistics involved with simple supply and demand functions within a business setting which resulted in severe downsizing.
bad,"Assurant is committed to developing all sites with a CMS called Sitefinity. The problem is that it's not fully understood or developed correctly. It doesn't have full developer support as no developer there is in favor of working with it."
bad,"Very busy workload, managers not there to answer question, no open door policy, very cut throat, this is what I would call a watch your back company, everyone is out to get everyone else to keep their job"
bad,Customer's are calling in mad about something on their credit cards that they didn't agree to. It's your job to sell them a scripted rebuttal and urge them to keep what they didn't agree to.
bad,"This position was extremely stressful. People screaming at you constantly. People crying, cursing, begging....very emotional. Management was poor and never wanted to help with highly escalated calls. The pay was ok, and the benefits were actually pretty good. Also, cool perks, like giveaways during holidays and annual bonuses."
bad,"Doing the required tasks at the stations, factory/ warehouse responsibilities, sitting most of the time, making sure that the product meets the company's requirements"
bad,"Assurant is restructuring and have laid off and/or fired over hundred  Employees in the last 2 yrs in the Duluth office. Tens of people have quit. "
bad,"Leadership at the top of the organization has changed over the past few years.  The people who knew how to lead others are gone.  The ones that are left do not have a clear vision for the organization.  This has a trickle-down effect.  Mid-level managers are unable to explain to staff where the company is headed and how they can support the efforts."
bad,"Productive, Stressful at time. They have health ,medical,401k life insurance benefits. You have the opportunity to Telework from home.. You have an opportunity to help with different projects...etc Breast and Cancer walk..."
bad,The best part about the company are the people. The people make the place worth coming into daily. The environment has changed and moral is plummeting.
bad,Often the resources know more compared to management.  The management has been promoted thru the buddy systems and really lack the expertise to run a successful business.
bad,Assurant is not a bad company overall to work for. They pay a decent salary. The reason I left Assurant is because the management team I was working directly under was horrible. They always ask for more out of your position but no advancement or pay was given for the more work you did for them.
bad,The business model for the company is making money off of foreclosure homes and maintaining home property so it does not devalue. When the economy is healthy Assurant Field Services has a hard time making ends meet.
bad,"You go in do your work and leave.  Say nothing and you will be alright.  Make no comments, stay to yourself and never complain.  You will do fine. Treat you as a robot."
bad,"I really enjoyed working with my co-workers at Assurant. If there is something this company does extremely well is recruiting quality people. However, Management is not the best qualify nor the ideal to lead a company."
bad,Very top down hierarchical culture.  Need to move more towards a bottom up approach where employees are empowered to make decisions and drive innovation.
bad,"Managing Que,we had points to communicate with customers in a short period time. This was not a great fit for me as the talking points required did not meet the basic information the customer wanted."
bad,"This is a good place to work if you don't really have many options or your a recent graduate or college student. You take calls all day and most if not all your calls are monitored and your criticized about everything. Your are constantly micromanaged and some managers are better than others where the ones who don't micromanage you actually treat you like an adult. Your constantly watched if your on the phone, you go on a bathroom break, any kind of break. the good thing is meeting new people and the people you train with are actually nice and really cool and they realize you all are on the same boat and pretty much screwed depending on who your manager is."
bad,"This company has some great ideas and talented people, but seems to have trouble moving in a unified direction. Hopefully their reorganization in July 2016 will help them with this challenge."
bad,"Same as the world, the people at the top are happy, or appear to be, the majority of the folks at the bottom of the ladder will stay at the bottom until their services are no longer  needed. "
bad,"•	Accountable for inbound communication with homeowners, contractors, and third parties regarding damages and repairs to properties. "
bad,"I started at this company approximately 8 years ago. During that time I needed a job so I started in Customer Service at a lower rate of pay that I was making at my previous job. I got a progression to a different department which started out okay."
bad,Remember your role playing when entering the building for work.  The corporate atmosphere is vital to your continuation of steady employment. But don't expect growth unless you fall in the description of the Ideal Image or your lips are used for caressing bile. This Corporation is a team of Cracy that have resources beyond your understanding. They will put you in your place. So step lightly.
bad,"1 - typical day at work"
bad,Assurant has laid off 1/3 of its workforce and is now trying to restructure. It has frozen it pension and doubled and tripled the work for the remaining workers.
bad,"The company is extremely proud of its training program and puts a lot of hard work into training you up for its customer service and administration roles for your first few weeks at the job. However once the hook is in they will slowly over time add more and more and more to your workload with no pay increase or incentive to stay on in order to progress. The company will also go to every effort to ensure they are paying the bare minimum they can to its core staff which the CEO himself said are the lifeblood of the company. There is almost no room for growth unless you are willing to brown nose your way up to the top because hard work doesn't pay off at this company, instead you may get a sticker to put on your report sheet to say thank you for your commitment to the cause, but that is it. I could go on but to be honest all you need to know is this is the ultimate in revolving door recruitment because the only people that stay are those with little aspiration to develop their careers or those who are great at brown nosing their way up the ladder."
bad,The hardest part of the job was dealing with the company but I worked and did the job because the clients needed me which was very admirable on my part considering the clients that I was dealing with.
bad,while my time there management was very bias and promoted friends instead of the person better suited for the job. my time there as the managers left they hired more managers from the outside that didn't know the job and that ensued many procedures being broken and not followed correctly
bad,"Low salary, little room for any advancement or movement. Most do not stay longer than 10 years. their is a lot of H/R issues and they are not addressed properly."
bad,This Is A Very Demanding Workplace. There Are A Lot Of Drawback To Working For This Company. It Can Be Too Confining And Demanding At Times.
bad,"I took a 3 month contract position at Assurant to help them get caught up on their huge backlog of tickets. The training provided was good, when I was able to get it from the Team Lead. This person spent a lot of time chatting/giggling with co-workers, so it made it difficult to get immediate support. I then went to team members for help and was told by this person not to bother them, I was only to ask the Team Lead for help. However, the young intern that they had just brought onboard was allowed to ask team members questions at any time he needed. When I first started, they would keep asking  the intern and myself in the team meetings if we were coming back the next day. They admitted people would just not show up one day. I wondered why? I did have communication issues with the manager that hired me regarding the hours I was to work. Here I thought everything  was on the up and up and they were of the mind set that I was setting my own hours -> when the hiring manager had MISCOMMUNICATED the hours. I was not impressed from that point on. I loved the job, but I hated the very stressful, 26 mile drive I had to make, especially during the snow falls."
bad,"It is a great place to work, a lot of great people to work with who are more than helpful."
bad,I come in and get my computer up and going. Check the right fax que.  Print off faxes or email them to the employees that requested them. I work with my co workers and i also work by myself. I enjoy being able to where headphones and jeans.
bad,"Management is not savvy to the industry and not much help when it's needed.  There is a lot of favoritism in the workplace leaving those that work very hard without much opportunity to advance.  Much of the information you need to provide to customers is based on decisions made by adjusters but, customer service is not allowed  to ask them any questions.  Definitely a system set up to fail."
bad,"Challenging place to work, providing few opportunities for pay raises and promotions."
bad,Long works ours in the office and at home. Co-workers and management are ok.  I enjoy when you meet everyone in the office when working at home four days per week.
bad,Empresa que oferece boa localização ambiente de trabalho agradável e varias opções de acesso a seus funcionários. Dentro do ramo de seguros oferece plano de carreira.
bad,"I have learned a lot about time management and dealing with clients over the phone. TWG does not provide a lot of face to face interaction with their clients. There is not much comradery among the employees. We are all working for the same team however, that is not how it feels. The hardest part of my job is not having much company support from executives. The most enjoyable part of my job is learning new techniques in how to effectively keep customers satisfied.  "
bad,"Extreme disconnect between management and employees. Low pay, high production requirements that are out of reach."
bad,"company has excellent benefits however does not compensate for cross training for multiple functions, does not promote based on experience and skills, Company values stats more than the people working for them. Employees are numbers and not faces. High stress environment and constant mandatory overtime (shortened lunch periods) even when working 10 hour days. I would not send my worst enemy here"
bad,"I don't recommend anyone to work in the hazard insurance department if you do not want to get high blood pressure. Production requirements a lot of times are unrealistic without pushing yourself beyond healthy limits, that is if you believe in doing it the legal way. I have seen too many people bend rules to advance within the company by finding ways outside of instruction to process loans.Some of the loans are just not tended to at all. Management is in the dark about a lot of the mess that goes on. I advise new applicants to apply to alternate departments at Assurant. I wish I would have several years ago. The team leads have there favorites and will often cheat for employees."
bad,"At the Assurant, a typical day consists of homeowners calling and voicing their opinion and/or frustrations about how nothing is ever done in a timely manner. In most cases, the customers are correct. As a first line customer service rep. there isn't much that we can do besides take the punishment and hope that the customer don't become too irate to the point that they are simply disrespectful. It is a very stressful environment. As a CSR, it is vital that you learn; really learn the procedures to be effective at your job."
bad,"The director looks down on the staff. She is not engaging - threatens staff and does not support the staff. They only promote you when you post out and are likely to get another job or if you want to quit. They are all about stats and perception. They fake the numbers. The work is easy, the managers are slow. The ops managers are equivalent to McDonald's managers. What a waste as the benefits are good. Bad thing - managers all date each other at all levels."
bad,Started as a temporary employee and became full-time in 2008.
bad,It's a good company to work for. They have plenty of career options.
bad,"unprofessional, lack of room to grow, managers gossip, hypocrites, no integrity. However met life long friendships and gained insurance skills"
bad,"The compensation is not enough for the job. Changes are made quickly and last minute so, what what you know today may not apply tomorrow. Management is not helpful or knowledgeable with process or procedures and they do not fight for their employees. There's not a sufficient training process, you're thrown into the job and you learn as you go. The job is production driven."
bad,"Professional, Appearance, and the way you speak to others is very important to me. I feel no matter what if you're a leader you're suppose to lead by ex"
bad,Management constantly made stupid decisions and multiple instances of favoritism. Job itself is easy if you just go to work and get your job done without paying attention to anything going on.
bad,"The environment is very consistent, and the salary is nice. "
bad,"Assurant does not reward loyalty.  It happens often that the longer you stay with the company the more you get ""stuck"" in certain roles.  The compensation is a joke especially in the last few years.   The best part of this company is that many are able to work from home."
bad,Training was sub par and if you ask for help your berated by trainers. The training is sub par at best. If you happen to upset trainers they try to make you quit by riding you but if you kiss up to trainers their nice and don't come after you. It a popularity contest if they like you they leave you alone.
bad,"This place is what I would like to call a ""dream/goal killer"" type of job. I worked there for almost 5 years and literally worked my behind off. Tried to prove that I was a valuable asset to the company. Excelled in quality scores for years, was constantly asked to work on high-priority projects, tried to learn more than what was required. Tried my hardest to advance in the company with no luck. The same position I came in on was the one I left. This was an entry level position that anyone could've completed and I believe I did everything they asked of me and more. But yet they would tell me ""we need to see more from you"", ""there's no openings available"", ""we can't afford to lose you in this position"". It was excuse after excuse that I received until I eventually left. If you have any kind of dreams or goals when it comes to your career or job, then this is NOT the place to be."
bad,"Assurant was a good place of work only that it has no job security, As an security officer is Assurant I got good security experience from working in a building that has about 5000 people calling and harassing people round the clock and they were happy doing their job just because they were not the one at the receiving end of the calls the where making. It was the craziest job I watch people do."
bad,"job was challenging but didnt offer much of movement in the company"
bad,Mornings went quickly due to outbound and incoming calls handled. Stressful because of time restraint due to productivity tracker often was incorrect. Management in my department had their picks
bad,"Package and deployment of software across organization for desktops, Quest vWorkspace servers as well as Citrix servers.  Publish applications. Troubleshoot issues as well as provide support to Tier2."
bad,Sit behind a computer all day in a noisy environment. Very limited personal small due to sharing a desk. Learned a lot about hazard insurance on property. The environment has great incentives and does a lot of outreach work for the community.
bad,I work for this company for ten months. I was let go with no warning and no reason given. Very strict Q&A my team lead did not take the time to go over policy's in detail.  My advice would be don't waste your time they fire anyone at a drop of a hat.
bad,"Since being sold to a private equity, the culture of the company has gone down. The management that is being brought in does not value the employees. And work life balance has been pushed completely to the side."
bad,"working at this company, they want you to deal with customers within 7min and 30 or less every call, they want you to find a connection with the customer, but not talk to them, they will even give you a script to work with. they have high turn around, and not enough people, my training classes had 22 people in it. by day two we lost 3 people when they put us on the floor and gave us desks there were only 5 people including me left. I started as a temp to hire, when they finally hired us on there were only 4 left from our class, and that was in a 6 month contract. They people you work with some are nice and others are there to just work and go home. Call volume is insane, and you can find yourself with back to back calls with no break, cause they want you on the phones at all times unless break and lunch and you need to be locked in at the start time or 5 mins before. Trying to meat the expectation is hard, and they offer no leeway. The only things I like about working there was the fact that you could come dressed anyway you want, the teams would have potlucks, they would bring in catered food."
bad,"I learned more patience, how to file claims, and say ""Yes we have no bananas today"" better than at previous jobs. Upper management is more responsive to issues than lower management."
bad,"I worked here 3 1/2 years, I was doing exceptional well, but it was so hard to get promoted or move around within the company. They are so difficult working with when it comes to requesting off. They are constantly increasing the work load every other month but wont increase your pay. The company is a joke to work for."
bad,I loved the company Assurant but but the people there are predudious and only care about themselves. The managers are not interested in helping or keeping their employees happy
bad,A person has to be dedicated to the position they are chosen for. You  have to really want to be there on order to stay. I would advise to make sure you are doing what you are asked to do and excel.
bad,It is a fairly decent place of employment if you are just graduating college and/or working within a management position.
bad,Desk work. Fast paced. Need to have a good memory and problem solving skills. Support from supervisor. Benefits. Need customer service skills. Continual training. Advancement options available.
bad,My coworkers were great to work with. The job always keeps you on your toes and you're always busy. The management team does not work very well and doesn't manage the department very well.
bad,Being a good team player and hard work were not appreciated.  High Productivity and Accuracy were demanded each and everyday.  Success by intimidation was the work ethic.
bad,"If you decide to work at this company, don't make it permanent. Expect out the blue changes and possible layoffs at the beginning of the 1st Qtr. The raises are not that great (depending who is your manager). Be careful with the bonuses at the end of the year. You WILL be taxed at least 35%."
bad,worked there almost 9 years & was ultimately layed-off/out sourced to India
bad,"As a VSC Adjuster I am responsible for adjusting claims motor vehicle breakdown claims according to the terms and conditions of the contract. Claims can vary from auto, motor home, motorcycles, and recreational vehicles. I am also responsible verifying labor times to ensure that contract is able to address the correct amount and the repair facility is not over charging with overlapping time and accord to nationally recognized labor guides, i.e. Alldata, Mitchell on Demand, etc. as well as  verify pricing of part according to the terms and condition of contract, setting and taking vehicle inspection. "
bad,"Floor managers cannot take care of their group as they're in many, many meetings. 2nd level managers and above have no clue what employees encounter on a daily basis and if you complain and show documented examples, they seem to care but your complaints go NO WHERE. Process improvement does not exist here."
bad,"The company overall does not offer many opportunities for advancement. It pays horribly, and the health insurance is mediocre but much better than a few places. It's a tedious job, and very boring."
bad,"This company bought our department from another company, but they dropped the ball in getting employees on board with their company. There was very little information given to existing employees about new company. Our clients had been extremely pleased with our performance previously; however, the new parent company had the attitude that Denver people could not do as good a job as Chicago people. They were condescending to us and created a lot of hard feelings in the beginning. They did some bridge building after a time, but it was never the great place to work that it had been under Aon. Our people were very professional and continued to exceed the client's expectations, but they were never as happy with the new upper management. The company finally decided they did not want to continue to work in this area and closed the office."
bad,"Prefer not to review at this time"
bad,Poor Management. Not a place where you can trust the Senior management to fair and just decisions for leaders of the organization. No Career Pathing and favoritism.
bad,"The job duties and responsibilities itself were great.  However the management played the favorite card oh to well.  If you weren't one to suck up then you were first to be notice and sorted out on any and all things to get rid of you no matter how hard working or dedicated you are. "
bad,Management makes changes with no pre-planning of how to train and implement. It’s an absolute circus and the associates are the performing monkeys who double as lab animals.
bad,"The company was a great place to work, until management changed. I've learned a lot while working for the company and have no regrets with the  years that I were there"
bad,"A typical day at Assurant Solutions - well it depends on the day to be quite honest. To be fair, most of the problems that face this company come from the mentality of the management and of the workers.  The workers are generally good people, but there is no incentive to perform - so they generally do not.  There are several people who are stand-out workers, but they are the exception not the rule.  The mindset of several members of the management is one of passing interest, condescension, and is overall very toxic.  Some of them view their workers as lazy, replaceable, mooches and do not respect them whatsoever.  Do not get me wrong, there are good managers at Assurant Solutions, but the culture that is propagated at my facility is not a positive one.  "
bad,"Employed at Assurant for 10+ years, but the last couple years have turned into a nightmare.  Don't get me wrong, the pay and benefits are great for the type of job and this area and I've worked with some great people, but job security has taken a nosedive.  Too much work, too little staff, and too high of a quota for everything they're asking associates to do.  "
bad,Assurant is a nice place to work for.   The inclusive culture is one of the driving forces.  It is a high volume output service.  Management can differ from each department.   The most enjoyable part is definitely the people.
bad,Its a job don't look at Assurant much of a career.  The job security is great due to the fact business is overwhelming. Advancement within the company  seems impossible at times.
bad,"Half the company is trying to evolve in the wrong ways, and the other half is actively fighting against change so they can have 'job security'."
bad,"It was very difficult to be able to advance or to be promoted. I worked there for four years and could not get ahead. I was one of the top associates there, and that could be the reason why I never able to leave that dept."
bad,"Assurant pays standard call center hourly wages for it's front line, CSR I agents. Benefits are decent. The key problems revolve around honesty. In job postings and interviews you are told training is four weeks. Actual training is done in 2 weeks, the 3rd week you will begin taking calls on the floor in a special area with extra people to help you, the 4th week of ""training"" you are moved to your supervisor and begin taking calls as a normal agent. "
bad,"This job payed extremely well. At first it was a great place to be, the team was extremely collaborative and supportive. But I've never experienced office politics like I have at Assurant. Bias is a real thing there and preferences have never been made more apparent. They will thank you maybe once for something you've done extremely well, but will entirely harp on your shortcomings over, and over again."
bad,"Great talented people. Zero room for professional growth and/or internal promotions. Benefits are better than other companies, however, health insurance has increased a lot."
bad,"More layoffs today, already short handed, good luck to those that survived this round! You are going to need it. Had a good time while I was there, but wouldn't go back due to how layoffs were handled."
bad,"wouldn't want to work here again. My boss was great in the sense that he was no BS and would tell it to you straight like a father figure. "
bad,"on a typical day I take an average of 60-90 calls a day, the management is supportive but are sometimes left with false hopes, co-workers are amazing and very helpful and supportive, you will make friends for life. hardest part of the job is dealing with unhappy difficult customers and the most enjoyable part is the co-workers and team days."
bad,Enjoyed working with co-workers. Calling Insurance agency to renew their clients homeowners insurance. Update information on the client. Fax and email documents to the agency.
bad,"The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be, having the opportunity to work with the cross functional team and gained further understanding of the business operation."
bad,"Very good sales training, QA does leave something to be desired.  Typical day was spending more time in spreadsheets than coaching and developing the team."
bad,"I started working there in January of 2013. When I started there was no supervisor for my specific production line and they required another Supervisor to look after our line as well as her original lines. When we would finally get a supervisor of our own they were pretty much unprepared for what they were coming into. Now the supervisors seem so stressed out that they seem to take their frustration out on their employees. The senior management will not talk to you in a respectful manner if they think you have done wrong and in most cases they do not do any investigation before threatening to take disciplinary action right away. "
bad,Management is trash. They hire managers off the street who know nothing to run people who on the phones. Co workers are very nosey and hateful. Team leads think they are managers and look down on the CSR.
bad,"The co workers were very helpful and friendly. The company has issues. They do not accept doctor excused, even if you were hospitalize. I worked 50-60 hours weekly, but I got sick was out 3 days and the following week I had two deaths. I had been there since September 2018, in May 2019 I was let go for attendance. They do not appreciate their employees, very high turnover."
bad,"I had a great patient to care for. Even though I did more than what was in my job description cause we were friends, even before his accident."
bad,Common to see people around 90 days promote above qualified tenured reps due to favoritism. External hires start at pay tenured reps will never attain
bad,My business line culture is not enjoyable and is not recommended.  I would not recommend this culture for others. Pay is reasonable but work life balance is unreasonable and leadership has been lacking since I started.
bad,"After initially being trained well, they love to change your job entirely and not train you on additional systems. Puts you at odds with customers when you're required to help them with things that nobody has helped you to understand."
bad,Assurant is a good company but they will falsify information to there employers and it not being true would not recommend to others. worked hard even had some health issues but still worked bosses build you up and let you down
bad,"I was with this company for a year and was an exceptional employee - I hit my numbers consistently, was constantly praised for my attentiveness and commitment by my supervisors, was helpful and friendly to everyone, volunteered for overtime constantly, had great attendance, and was in the process of becoming a trainer for 2 different areas of work. I was then fired, having zero history of write-ups, for a very minor infraction, the actions of which left no negative repercussions or aftereffects. It is truly my belief that many of the higher ups really do not value their employees, and/or do not care about viewing situations critically and professionally, which ultimately ends up affecting their bottom line, as they let go many top tier, respectable employees."
bad,Unless you are apart of the 'in crowd' you won't get far in the company. Unfortunately the managers are over worked and as a result they do not have time for the colleagues they are suppose to manage. Can be quite pushy if you call in for sickness. Not all of them but the select few ruin it for all.
bad,"Everything is great in the beginning. Cafe is amazing. Managers partake with favoritism. There are temps that have been there for 2+ years, with no sign of perm conversion. Temps are treated as the underdogs and aren't allowed to participate in a lot of company activities. Company itself is great, unless you're a temp employee."
bad,Worked at assurant for about two years observed a lot of favoritism with the managers due to the company hiring a lot of family. Ok pay but small room for advancement will only be promoted if you are favored by the manager.
bad,"Challenging job focused on property insurance assistance and support to customers, financial institution clients and Insurance Carrier representatives. This is an excellent place to learn the insurance trade with the right attitude. Assurant is an Insurance Company provider, specialized in Lenders' Placed policies, servicing its main clientele: Financial institutions. Contrary to the previous Administrators, the new Management's later trend has been in reducing employment, but constantly adding new processing tasks to Representatives. Professional advancement opportunities greatly depend on office politics. Daily activities ranged from answering telephone calls from customers, Insurance Agents and Claimants, to property damages claims documentation processing."
bad,Assurant Solutions has a excellent work environment because of the warehouse is climate controlled. However that is because its a electronic warehouse. They do not welcome career advancement. Also if you do not know someone you will not advance even if you are qualified. That why they have a high turn over rate. during orientation they entice  you with all these promises that they do not fulfill.
bad,"Some of the management were truly great, others not so much.  The focus from most was very much from corporate's perspective.  When it moved operations back to Chicago those managers were highly rewarded while everyone else was simply laid off."
bad,"The company offers no advancements, salary is low, no profit sharing. The people are very good though and over all the atmosphere is great. But from a career standpoint it's not the place to be."
bad,I enjoyed working there till I started to get sick and then it began to be difficult as I felt that they did not believe me.
bad,"Assurant is great for young, not sure what direction to go people.  I am late 50's, worked with them 16 years, was making about $2.50 more than 19 year old new hires.  The insurance and benefits are ok, cost just keep going up.  Pay doesn't.  I did not hate working there - I loved most of the people I worked with.  The micromanagement needs to go, favoritism, etc."
bad,"Turnover in management is very high, changed within the company is ongoing. Diversity is great, dress code is great, work from home ability is great. Turnover in employees is constant."
bad,"Prior to becoming a public company this was a fun place to work, we were all like family.  Now the goal is to do more with less and to outsource as much as possible.  Improve that stock price is what matters most. All perks have been stripped from the budget, so what is left is an extremely average organization that tries to tell its employees what it's a great place to work. So work here if you must but otherwise keep looking."
bad,"I truly enjoyed the first years working with the company.  In the past several years, there have been changes that have affected the employees incentive programs and growth."
bad,"Great benefits / salary. Inadequate training for advancement / skill enhancement. Cut throat, deceitful, under-handed management. Too much cyclical turn-over."
bad,"Corporate culture is very much top-down with an expectation that you will follow orders instead of improving processes and technology.  There is constant urgency in Band-Aid solutions instead of looking at the issues and being proactive.  "
bad,"People okay to work with, managers are good but will hold personal opinions against you, work is easy but often over complicated. Terrible pay but great PTO."
bad,Don't ever work here. management is garbage. People are garbage. They only care about the money not a bit of your personal problems or health. Everyone think ps there above everyone else in the company and it doesn't balance out well.
bad,"From my experience, the group that I worked for, the Manager was known to state ""We are looking for excellence"".  Where I understand that concept, I believe that they could work on providing constructive feedback to their employees to help them improve their performance rather than expecting them to be excellent from the start.  The rest of the company was pretty fair and stable from what I could tell."
bad,I worked at Assurant temporarily.  I had a heavy workload with more work than anyone could handle.  I wouldn't recommend this workplace to anyone that I know.
bad,My manager went over and beyond to help me succeed but as far as the company they are more about the company than the employees you are over worked and under paid
bad,"I've worked at Assurant for over 10 years and the culture has drastically changed over the years. What used to be a fun, family oriented place to work has shifted to a numbers only environment where the only thing that matters is the bottom line. Their associates are undervalued and unappreciated, it seems that they have lost  sight of the concept that a happy employee is a more productive one. However, they do have an excellent benefits package as well as tuition reimbursement. It's not a bad place to work but there is definitely room for improvement."
bad,Work environment is good but there seems to be too many procedures left out on how to handle customers. It is a good way to learn customer service in a call center.
bad,As much as the job wasn't horrible after working there for years you get treated the same as if you started with little to no respect. Even people I knew starting out who have been working there for years still get treated like Unfairly even looked passed on promotions just because they favor the suck-ups (Though that's typical jobs I suppose)
bad,Competitive fast paced stressful environment with frequent mandatory overtime fairly poor benefits fairly decent pay rate bad management no career advancing opportunities
bad,This was a very fast paced job. Not much downtime. Wouldn't have been too bad if everybody pulled their own weight. People didn't do the job the proper way.
bad,This company held a meeting and told a department of 80+ employees that their jobs were being transferred to offshore employees and they would only get a severance package if they stayed on for two months and trained their replacements. Some of those people had worked there for 30+ years. Reprehensible.
bad,"The job was easy but long hours. They barely had enough room for all of the product that needed to be shipped out. Great people, however."
bad,I love the place and the job but the people there are not friendly nor fair. They have favorites and they are not laid back when it comes to family emergency.
bad,I believe that the company has a lot of issues when doing promotions and raises.  I was fortunate to have made it through to advancement but I seen a lot of people who were skilled being turned away because of favoritism on the part of middle management.  They were allowed to pick and choose who they wanted to promote and who they felt should receive a larger raise.  This was done with the overview of upper management who just doesn't have the time to 'really' review what they receive.
bad,Basically the same as above. I feel it does not have room to grow or move up. I have tried to move to different positions and there is always a reason why it is not a good time but when hired I was told different.
bad,Job security was an issue contract was only for a few months.
bad,Great job to make overtime . Anyone can get a job. Very unprofessional. HIGHSCHOOL.
bad,Call center environment to which warranty work was conducted. Warranties from Home to all applications within the home where covered by various insurance products.
bad,Workload was overwhelming. Too much overtime. People let go due to outsourcing.
bad,"A typical day at work entailed training associates, writing training material, scheduling required classes, assisting operations with anything required. Working closely with clients for new implementations."
bad,"The only positive things that I have to say about this company/location is that it was convenient and close to home, also they paid very well. Other than that they are a horrible company to work for. I worked in the call center, they will give you the run around on so many things, they are beyond disorganized even while training you, and do NOT care about your advancement. It's all about numbers to them, there is a time crunch for EVERYTHING you do. My direct manager would always try her best, but management above her didn't care at all. Co-workers were very nice and helpful (only a handful). There was nothing enjoyable about this job,besides my pay check, but it was very stressful."
bad,Answer calls from service providers and assist them with determining parts or replacement.  Reviewing customer contract to determine if cost effective to replace or repair.
bad,"Commission only position. Company's payout for sales made is months out. Job wasn't very hard, and the process was simply and straight forward. Product was misleading and not very helpful. Co-worker were all very supportive and the managers were great."
bad,"Unfortunately, I was victim to the lack of administrative professionalism and unfair ethical standards. the work environment was a diverse multi-ethnic atmosphere. Although some areas created unhealthy competitive and cut throat work environment the worse experience was ignoring unjust actions made against associates by administrative personnel. Unfortunately, many other veteran workers other than newly hires endured stressful mangement as well. Depending on the department you are assigned you will find some are professional and work effectively while others enforce tactics to create a facade of being inviting, just and fair. Retaliation is made when trying to advance to other departments. They have a heavy turnover and support from HR is not favorable when needed."
bad,Management makes the job harder/ depressing. may take years to even reach mid salary for position. only give 5-15 cent raises a year. there is a lot of favoritism.
bad,"Training was good - they got you equipped for what you were going to face on the floor. The food offered is superb too, as well as excellent benefits and perks. It is a good place to get further customer service experience, and the management team/colleagues were very supportive. There was a good rapport going on between teams, too."
bad,"Relaxed job "
bad,I get along with them very well training them make me get to know them more and the skills that they pick up fast. With any questions they would ask me or go the supervisior for help. I enjoy helping them and show and get parts when they needed
bad,When I begin this position I was very excited they were a new company then we change management and it wasn't enjoyable to work there anymore. I finally had to resign for peace of mind and maintain my health.
bad,"Busy, quite stressful, do to lack of information. (I do enjoy being busy, and having all the information needed in order to assist customers)"
bad,"Great perks, treated well by management however the business itself is a little shady. Assurant is a third part administrator of extended vehicle protection plans but does everything it can to not pay claims which makes dealing with customers and providers extremely stressful."
good,I would insure that homeowners insurance premiums were paid current. We would call if we had duplicate coverage from different companies. Worked from Queues.
good,The company or the departments want you to be a 100% with amount of work you must do a on daily basics. Would like to see the company work more on the training on there employers.
good,When I worked at Assurant it was hard to post out to another position within the company. It seemed as if management wanted to keep you under their thumb.
good,Assurant has its ups and downs like most company’s but overall it’s not a bad place to work for. It’s really a good place if you are out of school and trying to get started with benifits.
good,very nice work environment however they do not like to pay staff and there is no opportunity for growth. The agency I worked for staffed Assurant so we would not receive our full pay.
good,"I took customer calls for claim from home owners polices I work Monday thrush Friday 8-4. I was not at this location long,  work place was good no hard parts to this job ."
good,Lack of compassion.  Alot of don't care attitude just get it done is more important.  Get confused easily they can't make up there mind on how a procedure should be done.
good,"The overall job, is not bad. It is manageable. However, "
good,"Ok place to work ,Management needs more training .employees need to maintain a more professional attitude , overall work experience is a 5 out of 10"
good,"Company works hard to develop their managers / leaders.  The workload is heavy, yet everyone works together to make things happen."
good,This is a nice and enjoyable place to work. I enjoy working with others. The easiest part of the job is and data entry. The most difficult part of the job is trying to obtain verbal information for a homeowners policy.
good,you can grow in the company if they allow you too. I would advise to learn your position and then try to move up when you can. it's a-okay to work to get your foot in the door.
good,"Management was great until they got rid of every one. New management changed the culture, moral and worked you like a robot. The stress of the job made me sick to the point I couldn't use my left side arm and hand."
good,I worked at assurant for about 2 years and I’d say they have one of the worst management I’ve ever worked under. I’ve also witnessed poor and lack of manager involvement.
good,"Progression is reasonable provided you pick the correct route."
good,The training class gives you limited training to what the job actually requires once you are on the floor. You are literally thrown into your role to fend for yourself.You are only offered minimum coaching once you do not make the numbers required for quality and adherence. Quality is determined by a department unskilled on the phones and they often grade you with errors that you have to challenge.  It is not an environment which nurtures employee success. There is a constant threat of termination. Customers get transferred through various departments before the reach the right one and internal transfers are often sent to the wrong department.  Managers are often in huddles discussing personal business and not assisting their team.There are few managers that are professional however it is apparent they have not had management training. Agents are very frustrated and are not trained properly.
good,Building closed in my area. Upper managers promoted their friends only. They would ask us the answer to customers questions when the customer ask for a supervisor. Co-workers would fake work to look busy. Told customer wrong things in order to get commission and promotions. Lack of security allowed many thefts both inside and out of the building. Was on many different contracts which work force planning would switch gating without telling anyone. Scheduling had 11 people on the floor with 7 of them on breaks or lunch at the same time if everyone showed up.
good,Great company to work for! I was recently laid off due to elimination of  the QA Compliance position. I loved my job and team that I worked with.
good,"I like my current role as a Research Specialist, I have a flexible schedule and I work with a good team of individuals. We have good employee engagement activities and we work from home."
good,A day at Comcast could make you or break you do to the in-bound   call flow fast paces you really must think outside of the box
good,No career advancement; only use as a form of income. Great co workers; minimal training. Mundane work nothing to challenge your brain.  Required to take verbal abuse from customers
good,"Sometimes a fast paced environment. There are skills to be learned and obtained. There are times when you can advance, but you must hold your current position for 9 months before you can apply."
good,"I worked in a department that was notorious in the rest of the company for being like a prison with unfavorable working conditions. Many other people around the company were very happy with their position and loved the company but because where I worked it was horrible. There were cameras at almost every desk, absolutely no respect for your intelligence as a person or an employee, management is borderline incomptent, high level of micro-managing, low pay and a don't care attitude from management about your grievances about the pay( I once worked 80 hours a week for a month and my check was barely over $1000); they just blamed the clients of the company, no incentives, mandatory overtime, low retention; they fire people left and right. Again though this was mostly just my department supposedly"
good,"Work days were okay. But when changing to a new client, Management had unreal expectations. There were loads of call outs and very few returned calls with the information required to perform the job. Mostly people just ignore the issues and pass it along to someone else. So If you were the unlucky person .. you had to fix their errors and that slowed the processing down. If you did what was required. The management was always riding you to do better... faster. Information was presented for the larger clients...but not so much for the smaller clients. This made it confusing as to what you were to apply to the client you were working on."
good,It’s a great starter job just getting into the field however not good for long term or if your raising a family on your own but great way to get your feet in the door
good,"Challenging but rewarding."
good,"Assurant portray a market leading facade, unfortunately they fail to meet thier own high expectations and often under deliver. They are delivery focused and not people focused."
good,"Assurant has great benefits and the work is not difficult. However, the recent change in culture has made the work enviroment unbearable. Many associates and managers have left the company because of the new guidelines that are impossible to meet. The associates feel like the processes are there to ensure failure so that the will be terminated without being eligible for unemployment benefits."
good,Company was good and stable when I first started out. Dealing with the calls we are not paid enough and very short staffed.  Co-workers try to work together but we all are stretched so thin. The hardest part of my job is the company's job security they have laid off several hundred people in the past 6 months. The best part is being able to help others.
good,"Assurant is a very report driven company.  If your car catches on fire they will call you to make sure you got your report out in time.  The management team motto is ""Figure it out"".  It's not a lot of training so you have to come in knowing your job and all of Assurant's company information by way of research yourself.  They have good benifits and decent compensation, just make sure you get your reports out on time."
good,I liked working with a lot of the people at assurant until we got a manager that throught that she knew everything and forced people out of their jobs.
good,Answer calls and provide excellent customer service skills to process claims on cell phones. It is pretty much independent work unless you have a question and need to ask your supervisor who is in the same area as you. Supervisor's can be helpful but moody at times depending on how hectic their day is going. Most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that even though your dealing with tough and difficult customers you have a job and your making money. There is nothing hard on this job at least to me. There are tough moments with the customers when they are upset or can't always get what they demand but it is nothing I can't handle. You just need to have tough skin.
good,"Coming in the afternoon greeting the team setting up computer for days work, going over emails for new policy changes or new training schedules or team meetings.  Different ways on how to engage the customers when educating them about their products.  Management was ok at times they would come around and greet the teams and try to remember your name, but floor supervisors was a different game there if they liked you they would assist you if they didn't the job was made harder. Co-workers were great always helpful. The  hardest part of the job was getting management to understand that the information provided to us on the computer at times was out dated and that it was unfair for quality to score us on new policies when the information was not updated on the system. The enjoyable part of the job was getting to speak to the customers educating them and resolving their issues. With the projects that the team got to work together with."
good,"A typical day at work can be stressful depending on the work that is in the system. Production is always a must, which can make the job even more stressful if the work is not divided correctly. This job has taught me a lot about research. By doing research I am helping the homeowners to sometimes find out why their home policies have been cancelled and what they need to do in order for them to reinstate their policies. When it comes down to management, I feel that all managers need to have a course every six months on how to deal with the stress levels from the companies. As far as my co-workers which whom is very stressed also, we try to help one another with the job, we help each other by laughter, and we like to have a lot of dinners when possible. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the production everyday, especially when a problem comes about with the homeowners policy. The most enjoyable part of the job is when upper management do different things to show how they appreciate the hard work that we do."
good,Ok place to work for its time. Did alot of extra hours while opening a new building.
good,This is a good place to work in the short term. This is no long term opportunity for working at Assurant unless you the right connections. Low paying salary
good,"The company uses old technology and management style."
good,Lowest paying call center job I ever been to. High turnover. Management does not know anything. People think they are better than you if they were promoted.
good,"I wouldn’t recommend Assurant to anyone looking for long term. The company markets itself as a place to get comfortable and stay were all family and were here for you lots of advancement...... but that couldn’t be farther from the truth. So many times I’ve been told how all of us are replaceable. Watched many co-works get called to managers office and fired for petty things. The company pays well and does offer good benifits. You get a lot of “personal” time off paid. But if you try to use it for being sick, your family being sick, your car breaking down, or any unexpected and unplanned event it’s counted against you and after so many times your fired with no concern or second thought. Lots of favoritism with management they pick and choose who to help and support and push for promotion based on how much they like you not your numbers. Watched many friends and co-workers get passed up for promotion and advancement. Many times “senior” associates were the worst about missing time and call offs and poor quality reviews yet they were moved up and those of us working over time constantly and pulling good or exceeding numbers were wirtten up for calling off 1 day due to a family emergency. The FMLA policies were also a joke refused to cover things that should qualify. Just a general lack of care for the advrage employees health and wellness in and out side of work. Have even watched pregnant women in the office punished for having to go to the bathroom more frequently then others. If you need a job to pay the bills Assurant is ALWAYS hiring new people. But if you want a career a"
good,"The job was okay, but the Management was unorganized. Management would make careless mistakes in the mailroom, but would try to make it as if the Associates did it. So I think that Deb Davis needs to check up on Management a little more often without giving heads up that she's stopping in."
good,They have staff that have worked for them about 20 years. Job security is high for their own employees not for contractor based staff. They have different locations in USA and has more than 1000 employees. The company cannot be flexible to the changes on their external environment because of bureaucracy
good,"During my time, there was a transition period while they acquired a new building and a new manager was trained. Management did little work, but got all of the credit. Work load was usually pushed off onto the SME's or Subject Matter Experts."
good,"Personally, I had an enjoyable experience BUT this company outsourced over 300 jobs to another country and hundreds of people lost their job. It is not right."
good,"answer 50-60 calls a day from homeowner discussing coverage and payment. making payments from escrow accounts, contacting agents to speak about coverage,"
good,"With this new management team, I do not recommend this dept for anyone.  We are overworked b/c the retention rate has declined rapidly.  One person is responsible for duties that take 4 people to manage.  The management team doesnt care whether people stay or leave.  The morale has diminished terribly.  The new people are shellshocked once they come in and realize the workload given.  This is a sink or swim environment."
good,Poor communication and talent management.  Fails to manage by fact and make return on investment based decisions.  Management is hit and miss when considering opportunity and leadership but many great employees have left for other opportunities due to lack of development or advancement while long time but less skilled members persist.
good,Lost a lot of great candidates due to power struggle two hours north of my location. Management at the local level was amazing. Until they let one of them go.
good,If you want to be content and not move up in the world of business then this is the place for you. They do not promote their best workers. They will tell you what you want to hear so they can use you to do varies jobs.
good,"You could work 18 hours a day, 6 days a week (often did) and never make a dent. There were not enough staff to do the work that needed to be done. Upper management in the office I worked in seemed to do very little, yet take credit for the work of others. There was no positive feedback, only criticism, and often, belittling. "
good,"I was a contract employee, seemed most except managers. My managers never had much communication with me, to let me know how I was doing - great, good, bad - I never knew. I was extended, and the next week, they let 15 of us go two months early."
good,"The current environment is to complete a heavy workload, working extra hours (at no additional pay) whenever necessary."
good,They presented the department as a collaborative group of people who work together towards a common goal. Where management is open to hearing and implenetening new ideas to improve processes. Well that was not the case. What I got was micromanagement at it's worse! Basically they want you to push through as many files as possible and take orders from 3 supervisors...You guys say you want critical thinkers and problem solvers but when someone has something to say they are shut up. They pulled the shade over our eyes will upper management steadily let people go. Our department went from about 30 people to 3!
good,The whole experience depends on the client you have to work with. I had worked with two different people and it was night and day. I was humbled and appreciate not working in this field.
good,"Hours may be terminated at any time due to nature of the job (a patient dies). "
good,"If you like to be micor managed.. and watched this is a great company to work for."
good,"The company is solid and the industry is recession proof, however the management team is a joke! One of the core values is to protect the core but it's more like throw each other under the bus to keep your job!  Management refuses to offer training for the moving target and ever changing client procedures processing reps have to follow and the quality department is obviously getting kick backs to make processors look like they do not know their job.  The place is less than professional and I would not refer my dog!  I think that there is definitely potential if the archaic and grandfathered management team were wiped clean and new, professional and experienced managers replaced them."
good,"Loved working with my co workers but management was horrible.. It seems like they hire managers off the street because they never know what's going on or what they're talking about. "
good,Started at this 6/24/13. Job is stable and not hard to learn. Difficult to advance. High turnover among management
good,okay place for springfield. Just a stepping stone as the only way to move up is who you know not what you know.
good,"A typical day...all I do is answer phone calls from irate customers. Some customers are good to work with, but a majority of the time they can be out of control. I learned plenty about the mortgage industry and unfortunatley the greed associated with all the mistakes made during the 2008-9 mortgage meltdown, and how Assurant was an intragel part of it. Based on that alone people are in fear of making decisions on accounts making them concerned about their jobs. Management..that is a joke.  The departments do not speak with each other causing a communication break down.  In turn, one department attempts to usurp the authority of another department. Things are not black and white, they are gray.  Hard work and loyalty to the company will get you know where. I applied for over 40 positions and only got one which was a lateral move. They hire unqualified outsiders, and the people they do hire internally for positions like team leads are more qualified the management. If they do hire a manager internally, that person has less qualifications then my dog and couldnt manage an ant farm. I am an adult and dont need to be babysat.  I dont like going into a job  wondering if I am going to be employed at the end of the day. My co workers are good people, it is management who lacks the ability to lead"
good,"Depending on your position, this is a job, not really a career. It's kind of hard to advance in this company, unless you are very friendly with management."
good,"Promotions should be more ethical."
good,customer service department was horrible; the managers were always showing favoritism. the calls were stressful and there was no resolution/follow up to customers
good,"Depending on what department you in, you will find that,  if you are not a part of the ""in group"" u wont advance and wont be compensated fairly. Mmwith that said, there are MANY people who have been there over 20yrs"
good,"It is clear this company is only out for itself, while it is steady work it becomes extremely stressful and they try to ensure you have a good time with pathetic gifts like donuts, pizza or bags of chips."
good,This employer will work with you to ensure that you are able to excel at the job. If you are looking for a job that is consistent and predictable then this will be a great job for you.
good,Pay was too low and lacked opportunity for advancement. Management was just looking out for themselves with no coaching and opportunity to move forward.
good,"HR was incompetent.  I was let go due to medical reasons.  Tried to get FMLA but was turned down.  The people were nice, management was not however.  To be honest I'd still be there if they had worked with me while I was sick.  Second shift had some really nice people.  Was very multi cultural which was nice, got to meet a lot of different people."
good,High volume of calls. If you like a fast paced career this is for you. Poor communication though. Workload high. So is the stress. Managers are about a 4 out of 10
good,"I learned a lot working here with the role i have as a claims examiner, i have developed amazing communication skills from working with customers over the phone and the people who managed my department. "
good,"Assurant was a temporary job.  I was there for about a year.  It was not my ideal job, but it was a job.  Assurant is a call center environment as well and the location was in Duluth."
good,"They have a great company, management has some issues, the have a great client, however management has no clue on how to manage the client. Things constandly change from day to day, high turnover , and a uneasy feeling with day to day operations."
good,its very good pay well i worked as temp  but the company is not a bad place its just the leadership they are not very helpful people but the co workers are nice
good,You have your space and only your space if  are a loner and only want to work in cubical land with no real conversion face to face this is your place.  I am personally a people person.
good,"A huge company with very fast paced and stressful climate. Management is not attentive and unhappy. A lot of good employees, but no job security due to outsourcing a lot of positions."
good,"Call center...hours were not very flexible, then they went from no part time at all, last minute changes to schedules, Christmas party was fun, great prizes. Great if you wanna be there long term but not many chances to move up."
good,A typical day at work was the manger was never there. I never got the proper training I needed for the job. The most enjoyable part of my job was the food and seeing the smiling faces of each customer. I really didn't get to learn as much as I wanted to that's why I decided to quit. There wasn't really a manager in office. The workplace environment was very hostile.
good,"Good beginning and experience if you are fresh out of college, but advancement limited in certain departments. Management doesn't always treat employees equally."
good,Meaningful work with lots of opportunities to gain experience in your given expertise. Great place to start off and learn.  Unique culture; not for everybody.
good,Once you are acclimated with your workload they will send you home to work. I have learned a lot about mortgage insurance and why its needed.
good,Fun work environment and great co-workers. Poor upper management team and highly political environment. Has lots of potential to be a good company to work for.
good,By working for this company I have learned how to be very resilient and adapt to change quickly. This company has given me the work experience under several different banks and I am incredibly grateful.
good,"Started as a temp on the phones and worked up to a more comfortable position with flexibility and slightly more engaging assignments.  Management is largely disorganized and held unaccountable.  There are too many chiefs and not enough Indians. Communication is terribly broken so associates are unaware of expectations, procedure changes, and important new policies.  Training is wholly inadequate but management is quick to hold under-performing associates accountable.  This company has spiraled quickly downwards in terms of morale, client relations, and market presence.  After a previous round of layoffs (not even a year ago), there were job ads on this site for those newly-vacated positions the next day.  This is a poster child for a business unit in decline and anyone still working in the Specialty Property division needs to see that after multiple rounds of layoffs no position is safe."
good,"At first the job is great as they want you to continually grow, once you advance to any position however other than just a general floor rep you almost do not get noticed anymore. Management does not help when you have situations that arise that ""Need"" to be addressed . One upside to the company is the room for your first advancement is/can be quick, the only downside is that even in semi-management positions in the company you have no say and even when given the chance to give input nothing you say will make a difference."
good,The company is good but the management is not. They give you the opportunity to work from home but fail to advise you that there is no room for advancement once you are home.
good,"Overall it is a decent place to work. However, as you move up within the company, the work/life balance becomes more of an issue. Many people have left due to the time commitment required of the job."
good,i learned alot about cell phones and how they work. no money in it. no room for advancement. good warehousing experience.
good,Laid back .  Management does not take interest in grooming employees.  Little chance for advancement
good,Although I was one of the top quality performers my manager still was very discouraging and unprofessional. Assurant I thought was a pretty good company but upper management shouldn't treat their unit managers as friends more than employees.
good,"Started out full time, the pay here is decent as a starting pay. Usually around $9-10 depending on the job title. However, after working here for multiple years, it came to a point where I just had to leave. Most departments are like mini classrooms in high school where the drama is overwhelming and it seems as though no one is mature enough to be adults. In 5 years of being at Assurant, I received a total of a 62 cent raise. Although the medical insurance was decent, it was extremely overpriced and was constantly changing from year to year and was hard to keep up with. It is a very fast paced, exciting job, but once that excitement wears off, you begin to realize how horrible the company is overall. Like I said, its a good place to work temporairly, but not a good long term career choice."
good,"Almost impossible to advance. Management is comprised of people uneducated in management, and lacking interpersonal skills. Favortism among management, team leads and employees."
good,"Can be challenging if you work in the right group, but otherwise can be demoralizing in the wrong one."
good,"The best part about this job was probably the benefits (401K, health insurance, PTO). The job was ok for the most part but nothing I could see myself doing long term. After four years I was never promoted even though I was promised a promotion, the raises were only about a quarter each year, the Christmas bonus was taxed heavily, you are being micromanaged and they don't really want you to have any conversation, etc. You sit in front of computers all day and they don't offer vision care"
good,"Assurant is TOTALLY about the clients they service and don’t care anything about the employees they employ. Assurant Promotion is not about what you know but about who’s butt you can kiss. Pay not good enough for the stress it causes. Good job, not career"
good,"Good place to work, little to no advancement. Work from home position so no interaction with people around you which maybe good for some people. Emails to managers and never get response."
good,"Good place to work if you’re just looking for a paycheck. It’s brain dead being on the phones all the time. Fortunately I advanced positions after five months of being hired. All in all, if you are able to separate your personal life from your work life then you will have no problem moving forward within Assurant."
good,"Working here is alright, I don’t get paid enough for my experience and I feel stuck, they won’t get me a chance to move up in the company even though I have the stats to prove I deserve it. I am frustrated with this company but love my co workers"
good,Productive and take great care to provide great customer service to internal and external customers and clients. Strive to ensure that team and company moral is high.
good,"very stressful, calls are counted and checked for scripting error (very strict on that).  short lunches, 30 minutes, not always scheduled at mid shift.  I clocked out five hours after lunch with one 15 min break."
good,With the right manager there is endless guidance and opportunity. With the wrong manager life is h e double hockey sticks. The harassment is unending. It's like having a gun to your head daily. Quality and production standards have reached highs that can not be maintained on a continual basis and the crabs in the barrel mentality that have taken over the organization has resulted in the loss of many great people including my mentor. What was once a great career opportunity is now a high turnover stepping stone.
good,Just like any company you have your good and bad management. Depending on your shift it's very hit and miss. Second shift had some of the best management I have seen while the other shifts tend to be careless of what happens. Upper management does not care about the employees at all however.
good,"Minimal room for advancement."
good,My review was good. Raises were not acceptable but had no choice and some people didn't get a raise. Raises were once a year. Employees are leaving even just walking out. When the company was BroadTec is was family oriented. I can say I was blessed to be there for 10 years.
good,"Management really tried to battle for the employees and they are always open to suggestions and to listen.  Able to work remotely, which give me flexibility with good hours. Hardest part is communication between departments."
good,"PROS : "
good,Assurant is a company full of good people. The problem is the lack of stable management and direction.  While there I saw a yearly decline in the culture and the loss of talent.
good,"The people at Assurant strive to keep customer service at the forefront. It is a very hard working and dedicated environment. "
good,"Very busy workload, managers/team leaders not there to answer question. No open door policy, very cut throat. There was also not an opportunity for those who wanted to grow in the organization to do so. In order to advance, you had to know someone. A lot favoritism   and unfair work practice"
good,"The clients were demanding, work was fast paced, management was ok depending on the team. Upper management out of touch with how things work.  Great benefits. Flexible hours."
good,Management needs to work on creating a more engaging work environment to allow for a more inclusive atmosphere. More opportunity for employees to relocate and full filling promises made.
good,Used to be good though indian porr managers made it like one indian miserable company where there no place for American highly qualified employees upper management doesn't give s about it as they are only worried about getting their bonuses
good,"Very intense and tedious! Quality work is a must. High turnover rate with employees! Coworkers are helpful and the work environment is friendly, amenities like the walk path, cafeteria, coffee centers and nice break areas."
good,In customer service you take many calls during the day for different skills. I learned a lot about mortgage insurance. The culture is fast paced. Most enjoyable is resolving customer issues.
good,"Overall job is stressful, they tell the employees there is room for growth but the moment you mess up they give you a warning and let you go. Supervisors are suppose to be there when help is needed. However, job was comfortable pay was great."
good,My schedule there was 11:30am to 8:00pm Monday through Friday you get 2 15mins break and 30mins lunch my first break is at 12:45 my lunch normally is 3:45or 4:00 which means if you can handle that you are good to go.
good,"For the entire 1st year you will be constantly traveling. I did not see my wife and kids for 3 months strait. I had to have them drive to me to see me for one day. If you are young and looking to travel then this is the job for you. Once you learn everything they teach you, you can get into the retail side and make real money."
good,"Flexible schedule"
good,"When I started there the facility was owned by The Signal and it was an enjoyable place to work.  After The Signal was sold to Assurant the place changed.  Assurant has a good reputation for its various insurances businesses but does not seem to understand how a warehouse/manufacturing facility should operate.  Instead of advancing from within, the company started looking solely to outsiders to fill management ranks."
good,I loved working with everyone for many years. The management was constantly pressing for new initiatives immediately that were not even close to closing. This caused a ton of stress.
good,"Not the job for me, not a good work place for me. It's alot of unfair choices, people aren't treated equally, I feel like they are racist."
good,"Daily assignments entailed resolving residential and commerical insurance information for clients/customers."
good,They showed a lot of favortisim to certain employees. Would not recommend working for this company at all! Also they have a very high turn over rate!
good,"Assurant used to be a growing & innovative company with competitive pay & great benefits. Unfortunately, recent years have seen the company decline, resulting in cuts & layoffs across the board."
good,"Chaotic at times"
good,I enjoyed working at Assurant before most of the management took their retirement packages.  The culture leaves much to be desired.  I do not see much advancement among minorities and that's unfortunate.
good,A typical day at work was very repetitive. Verifying information on scanned documents and forwarding through the system to be finalized electronically.
good,a typical day there was slow and you would have to constantly ask for more work to do. i learned how to use a scanning software
good,A typical day at work I assisted customers with their life insurance policy also helped them to make payments. I learned to assist the customer as was directed by policy. Management could have been easier to work with. My co-workers were easy to get along with. the hardest part of the job was not being able to help the customers family when the customer could not speak for them self. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the customer and helping them to understand their policy in ways that they understood.
good,A typical day includes dealing with upset homeowners and trying to make sure that they are taken care of by reassuring them and making things as easy as possible for them.
good,The managers work well with the employees to ensure that there work needs are met.
good,"Significant mgmt changes in past 18 months.Just bought by a Texas global private investment firm. Biggest challenges are instituting culture changes and encouraging employees to act with a sense of urgency. Some mgmt had difficulty in translating urgency into properly prioritizing day-to-day workflow."
good,"Log into systems, find available work, seek additional training which is too often difficult to recieve, management seems uninvolved or diconnected from employees"
good,"Management and associates are always transferring to different places. Either by promotion or changing clients, so that was a plus. Work was great for years then things just got to be too much and too fast. Dumped with way more requirements to do in a day than was logically reasonable and most managers didn't even know who you were (which I thought was funny cause of the 6 managers over me in a 5 year period, only 2 knew my name) so when reviews were due, most reviews were ""incomplete"" as the new manager didn't have enough information about the employee."
good,Demanding but amazing place to work. If you want to be challeneged apply here. People are awesome and so was the location for me!  Process driven organization and well run company.
good,The hardest part of this job was that management have employees in the department that they like more and will help that employees move up in the company when they are not the right person for the job.Other are looked over for advancement.
good,"I enjoy my coworkers and the work I do, but there is no escaping the poor management. Many managers there, including mine, are just unqualified to be managing: careless, inconsiderate, unprofessional. The culture there definitely puts managers on a pedestal, no matter how undeserving they are."
good,This company would be a good company to work for depending on the management you work under. Very fun environement when activities are thrown if your willing to get involved. Learned alot about homeowners insurance and the the back part that the banks play in buying a home.
good,"Depending on your role, management may be helpful or may be useless. The pay and benefits are decent.  Flexible with working from home.  The teams work really hard but are often unappreciated or rewarded for their efforts. The Wayne office versus Miami office is like night and day. Miami office is beautiful and has a real corporate company feel. Wayne office is small, cramped, always has building issues, and lacks the most of the amenities that the Miami office has."
good,"I really thought this was an amazing opportunity at the beginning. It was not. The benefits are sub-par, and expensive. Training is hard to come by and vague. There are obvious favorites in the office. I met some great people, but . . . ."
good,"It was alright working for Assurant.  I would say average. Not very much to say, management was average, the workload was average, they provided meals and donuts at times. n"
good,This company is ran like an elementary school. Not suitable for real professionals looking to work and such environment. Very poor management who micromanages every single thing. Unrealistic high production.
good,"They push quality for the first 4 weeks of training (""Speed will come, take your time!"") First full day by myself on the Repair floor, I got yelled and belittled for not getting quota! Hypocrisy and miscommunication is rampant there, it's sad because it could be such an awesome place to work. Been there less than 2 months and I'm actively seeking another job."
good,Too much pressure for too little pay. Insufficient training. Too many duties. Inconsistent management. Nice lunch fare. Nice attendance incentives. Too many clients
good,Worked eleven years. Needs to change type of work and make it more rewarding and exciting. I do have other qualifications as well and needs to utilize those.
good,While in training company announced that they were $90 million in the red for the first quarter and would be looking for a buyer.  What company in there right mind would touch such a lost...Anthem lol
good,"This could be a good job but training is horrible. You can either get stuck in a classroom for 4 weeks then thrown to the wolves or just thrown to the wolves. You have team leaders that tell you to look in this system that just don't help when they are sitting right there and can help. Overall it makes the job stressful because you don't know what to tell the customers, so you'll start lying. I could write a book about my short time there but everyone has to find out if they like it or not."
good,"It was a good experience working at Assurant.  Good team work and good people. "
good,"This place was a call center environment with calls coming in for loss, theft, damage and baggage claims. I also paid claims for loss, theft or damage after confirming the item in question was charged on an AMEX card account."
good,Amazing campus. Opportunity to explore many different career paths. Depending on department long hours with no work life balance. Company going through many organizational changes.
good,A typical day includes reviewing BPO valuations from real estate brokers. We determined if the broker did their job correctly and assisted them when necessary.
good,"A typical day at assurant coming to work an performing the same daily duties, No work life balance things are always changing and are up in the air. Things are never set and no growth.My hardest part was working for a manger that did not know her job and just assumed."
good,"There was no opportunity for advancement, it was a dog eat dog world. Everyone was vying for the 1 or 2 positions that may come open every blue moon.."
good,"Good place to work for a short time. My manager was nice and helpful. The location of the job was close to my home so that was an added plus. "
good,"My work and responsibilities are fun and challenging.  I work long hours with a small team, but am incredibly productive.  Generally have been able to focus on the most important priorities without too much bureaucratic interference."
good,"To work at Assurant you must be a quick learner or at least willing to learn and have an ability to multitask. There are many expectations for this job and I personally work as a customer care specialist. Honestly, the competitive environment of the job when it comes to expectations on scoring/audits, schedule adherence, etc. would be completely bearable if the pay were higher. A single person cannot comfortably afford to live in this city or many others with home or rent/car/child bills and the basic costs of living working at this job. The plus side is each year we are able to get a pay raise based off of our performance over the course of close to a year. I haven't been here long enough to know what a pay raise would look like with outstanding performance but I'm soon to find out. The particular client that I work for I LOVE so that is what keeps me content with my job. However there are many things that can be improved here, especially the pay rate. That's really my only complaint. Others will have differing opinions because it really depends on what manager you have, which client you work for, and your work history which will determine your rate of pay."
good,Large organization that was formerly privately owned. Each department and business unit has their own culture and growth opportunities.  Likewise the company is undergoing organizational changes from being decentralized to centralized.
good,"Managers didn't handle issues with other employees well. Had a mediation that didn't help mediate due to no mediator. Was asked to stay if work wasn't completed, but most people left. No recognition if you stayed."
good,I had a good experience over my 15 year career at Assurant and unfortunately they decided to discontinue their Health division which left me without a job.
good,I would only recommend this job if you have no customer service and or call center experience. This job would be a great job for you to collect that experience and go forward from it.
good,"Extremely politcal and a ton of redundancies in people and roles. They trip over themselves every day and overall deliver a subpar product. That said, its insurance so as they would say ""too big to fail."""
good,Assurant was a great company to work with but the last couple of years the company has not been doing well due to their management skills. The departments started merging together and caused issues between the managers because now you have 2-3 managers per department with the same amount of staff causing lay offs.
good,"I enjoyed working my year of employment at Assurant. Working there when the company was brought out by Assurant. I was promoted to the Escalation Team where I was the step before management, this was a tough position at first because, it's dealing with upset clients but once an relationship and understanding is built it's an much easier process."
good,A typical day of work consisted of 40-60 inbound calls per day. The guidelines constantly changed. The best part of the job was the large group of people you work with.
good,The Warranty Group didn't have many extra activities in the building.  No cost of living rises.  Management does not listen to the employees. No union.
good,"Assurant is dealing with reduced revenue and having to downsize and make changes, but overall it is a nice place to work.  Maybe the orders will pick back up and they will be stable once again."
good,"Unfortunately the pay is not the best and the higher management loves to micromanage. Even when numbers are good, management still likes to nitpick at the little stuff. Incentives have pretty much gone away, taking away from the morale of the employees. Overall, this job is good for someone who wants something temporary, but I couldn't do this for more than 2 years."
good,I have had the opportunity to learn a great deal regarding property loss claims. I have gained a great amount of knowledge regarding requirements for homeowners & flood insurance.
good,"Great Employer. Unfortunately downsizing, and lay off.  Typical day at Assurant was Processing a high volume or Hazard Insurance Claim checks and documents. I learned a lot about filing claims for property loss destruction and pay out in a timely manner."
good,Assurant did not provide ample room for advancment and it was a revolving door but if you did your job you kept your job for the most part.
good,"Not that it was a terrible job, it just was not for me or for my career. The job was good or bad based on the patient you had and I went from a womanizer/racist 90+ year old man to a very kind senile 80+ year old man and the quality of the job was like night at day based on location. The job was basically to be a friend and make sure the person was taking medications and was safe."
good,Be expected to change daily.  Be expected to be apart of a click and if you are not you will not fit in.  Be expected to work harder that what they are willing to compensate you for.
good,"42.5 hour weeks are filled with work and hard targets but rewarding once hit. I get to work with some great people and on some good technologies."
good,"this company is selfish and they use the title ""intern"" just so they can not give you full benefits or pay. You do the same work as any other staff auditor and are under compensated"
good,"Nice people (staff level) to work with. Company provides us with enough trainings to help the employees to perform the job. Sadly, little opportunity to grow or get promotions. The same merrit increase every year regardless."
good,Processed incoming insurance claim checks and corresponding documents. Also took some incoming calls answering customers' questions about their insurance claims and made outgoing calls pertaining to the advancement of said claim.
good,Typical warehouse duties shipped and processing cell phones into the system to get shipped out to be refurbished phones. I learned to work at a very fast-pace flow and how to multi-task with numerous duties. The management was fair but they needed to do better with showing recognition to the employee's hard work.
good,"Sometimes things are very chaotic"
good,"Downsizing has affected this company drastically. Sad to see so many good employees let go. Hopefully, things improve."
good,"Co-workers and peers were awesome and my staff was great, there seemed to be a disconnect between upper management and the rest of the staff which sent people leaving the company in huge numbers unfortunately. Floor staff was great to work with. Training staff was extremely positive and knowledgeable.The most enjoyable part was my people, and helping them to develop themselves and promote."
good,"Fluctuations in growths and opportunities. Currently, stable"
good,I really like the atmosphere at the Warranty group.  I wish the money was better and the advancement.  But overall a cool place...
good,Job is very secure but not much advancement. Worked with a great team which made work much easier
good,Great benefits and great place to work but very little room for advancement in the Minnesota office
good,Very large company.  Different site to move to if you are looking to relocate.
good,"Overall a decent place to work. Clean environment, nice break areas, full service cafeteria. Call center environment though is very high stress due to the nature of the business (Hazard Insurance). Break times are scheduled and vary by day/week. Schedules are less than family friendly and all time off has to be approved weeks/months in advance. If you have an emergency and need to leave or schedule a day off with less than 2 weeks notice it will count against you even if you have PTO available. Parking is a nightmare. Sometimes you have to park 1/2 mile away and walk to the campus because the lot is full, which put you arriving at least 30 minutes early for your shift to make sure you have enough time to park, walk and get into the building on time so you aren't late clocking in. Management is less than helpful. They refuse to assist on calls, referring customers to voice-mail, infuriating customers even more and then ""coaching the reps"" on escalating the call. Managers are never available and often ignore correspondence for days at a time making it more difficult to complete tasks in a timely manner, again affecting the reps performance. Lunch breaks are only 30 min and break areas are not close to most work areas. Most of your break time is spent commuting to the break area and back."
good,"Assurant is a good company.  I don't think that there is a lot of room for advancement from within.  I work in a production environment so my position was very fast paced.  My co-workers are great, everyone gets along pretty good.  Most people in the department has been there for 5+ years."
good,Mandatory overtime was great and coordinating special projects were rewarding.
good,"Customer Service Rep II, Poor training.  Not enough support from managers.  Very who you know type of agency.  More attention paid to what you're wearing than your standard of work.  The majority of employees were temps, whom sometimes worked over one-two years before becoming permanent. I learned about the claims process which was very interesting"
good,"My current job is in one word, boring. It is a repetitive work with no learning opportunities. Management is disorganized and none productive. I dont find any enjoyable part for this job. There is no hard part to the job. The job can be done by anyone that can read, copy and paste on a computer."
good,"un dia tipico: llegar 8:30hs dejar todo listo para poder comenzar a atender a los clientes a las 9 en punto, y mi trabajo culminaba 14hs.- y a veces a las 15hs."
good,Assurant was a great place to gain experience in corporate America
good,"Typical day at work: Signing into workstation at your own desk, This includes logging onto inbound phone system. This will automatically connect you with customers who are seeking to file claim on a device they have insured. You file these claims your entire shift, Keep in mind some customers will not be happy ones by the end of their call with you. Two 15 minute breaks and a half-hour lunch. Benefits are available at a discounted rate. If you're looking to move up in the company, plan on going to school to do so, as improving ones position title comes with little respect/recognition and pennies on the pay raise. The company does sponsor a company picnic or celebration during the summer. Innovation-minded people are encouraged to submit ideas, but most submissions fall under the rug. Encouragement to improve oneself overall on the workfloor is generally a tease and efforts don't get you anything past a candybar, a drink token or a thank you card. Cross-training into different departments is kind of a plus. They have a clean breakroom with vending machines, kitchen space, refridgerators, and a tv. Lockers are also allocated to each employee. If you get hired, BEWARE that what you learn in training will not, I repeat, WILL NOT mirror the experience and knowledge application which you are expected to use while on the phones. Center is close to shopping: Safeway, Groery Outlet, Mall across the way. Multiple fast food options surround it: Del Taco, Burger King, Quiznos, Panda Express."
good,I was told that when I had an issue with people standing around talking instead of doing their work when we were on manditory overtime that i should just turn up my music.
good,Assist homeowners with processing claim checks for property damage. Management and training could be better structured. The co-worker are great to be around and make the day go by fast. Hearing some of the tragic situations can be hard to listen to. 
good,"My typical day at work is supervising 22 people.  Loading and assigning work, assisting employees with question.  Reviewing reports and procedures. The most enjoyable part of my job is assisting employees, answering questions and being available to them."
good,Glad to have been given this opportunity and learned a lot. Length of internship was short.
good,"The people are wonderful and hard working. Great campus, ball fields, gym and caferteria. It is a great place to start out a career. Good luck to those that get in."
good,"Have worked at Assurant for 12 years. Overall vacation benefits are awesome. Medical is below par, advancement is more about who you know not what you know. However if you are in the right department/Manager you can move up and learn. It is a big company so there are some very good managers to work with."
good,"Work life balance was a struggle, pay is above average for market. Tons of educational opportunities. Including certifications and professional training."
good,"I might be a bit overly critical in my ratings, they dismissed me and never told me why, however I received a severance package that was beyond reasonable. The job isn't always pleasant, its inbound calls from very angry people, but I liked my coworkers and I've never had a manager make the team breakfast every now and then. Very good bonuses for those who meet or exceed targets."
good,"Great environment, good benefits, flexible work hours.  Front line management is antiquated and uneducated.  There is no Human Resource on site, and no employee advocate.  Assurant St Petersburg is Auto Warranty, Assurance is ANOTHER Auto Warranty company.  Assurant has too many unrelated ""books of business"" and not a leader in any of them (Cell Phone Insurance, Coffins? Rental Insurance, Auto Warranty, etc)"
good,"The job at Assurant is okay, however they could make a lot of changes as far as the management goes. The benefits there are awesome, however the overall workplace and a lot of the managers there are very rude towards their team workers. I loved my job but there was always an issue about something amongst the workers and the managers."
good,A typical day at work. I've learned how to prioritize my day. It requires your undivided attention. I would love to have found other opportunities to grow.
good,My last position was very stressful I took on many clients calls back to back. I have two kids and work a second shift. Management can have their favorites and only work with you when they wanted to. The pay wasn’t so bad for the area we love in.
good,"Company was ok to work for, I loved the company events for their employees and they do believe in feeding you. But theirs point system sucks and they are not consistent nor do they properly explain how it works, they tell you the points roll off in 90days but not 90 days from the day you got the point, they don't accept doctors notes at all so good luck on not getting sick or as in my case having an allergic reaction. They expected me to come to work with swollen eyes and a crooked mouth just to prove to them what was wrong with me"
good,"I really enjoyed my co-workers, very helpful and just authentic people. Think introductory training just covers the bare minimum; after that you are on your own. There are multitudes of policies and procedures that you have to learn in your free time between calls. When I started, there was no free time between calls. They time everything that you do, breaks, lunch, time on calls, when you leave, etc... They want you to have connections with the customer, but keep low call times. I am a friendly, warm person, so that was hard for me. I found other mistakes that other departments made that affected the outcome with the customer. I had to get those corrected. I believe that at work, you shouldn't dwell on personal;but my husband has health issues. The supervisors are not empathetic. To them, you are a number, not an individual. Most of them have been there for years, so they can't relate back to your learning experience.  They did try to be helpful to me and set up special learning experiences for me. But they are not positive motivators. I would like to have seen a day where they took calls as well as the Quality Control experts. It was not a horrible experience, but I would not want to work there, knowing what I know now. And I am a mature, educated individual who believes in putting in 100 percent. A lot of people have left from my training class. But in one training class after us, 20 came in; after two or three weeks, only 6 people were left!"
good,"A very demanding job that's only gotten more demanding over the years.  Best of luck to those that can withstand that this type of work environment. There are a few good managers out of these, and if you're ever lucky enough to get one, thank the Lord for them! "
good,Liked that I could work from home. Did not like the no raises or room for advancement aspect. They are learning from their mistakes and try to fix most methods that don't work.  They have gotten better at making processes and procedures universal and available to all employees. They are not shy about laying off people in large amounts however.
good,"Excellent service to the mortgage, banking industry.  Employment culture not suitable to older adults, mostly juvenile environment.  Cliquish environment, needs change.  Unclear why growth, by magnitudes, did not occur."
good,"At the beginning this company was awesome.  But as the years went by, the company went downhill. They stopped being honest and upfront with their employees.  I do believe alot of co workers would agree, if it wasn't for the relation ship we all had so many would have left"
good,"Great company, the claims department lacks leadership, communication, work life balance. Great benefits, and perks at the workplace. Career advancement not supported as it should be within claims department."
good,Lack of a positive team environment in my department. There were a few bad apples which made it very hard to do your job correctly and accurately at times.
good,"A call center position is great for a young 20 something looking for better pay that a first job, or as a supplemental income for a duel income family who needs just a little bit more."
good,"Company has several locations including out of the country. Where I worked, the workforce is diverse and able to make friends easily. The company provided instructions for us to do our work."
good,"A normal day at Assurant was to sit in my cube and work quietly.  Occasionally there would be a planning meeting to decide what to do next on our project.  It was like working in a library, everyone was afraid to talk to each other in fear of disturbing the other developers"
good,"I worked remotely - Louisville office, team in Atlanta.  Digital transformation is taking place and the teams are changing very often.  I had 6 different managers in 18 months."
good,A typical day at work is answering inbound calls from homeowners and INS agent regarding HO INS on the mortgage account. 
good,While i think assurant is a great job i dont think it provided the challenges i am seeking or fit my career path. The company has very little room for error or networking which makes the job that very boring.
good,"Any time you work Customer Service it can be a difficult job. I was excellent at my job.  We had to take 11 calls per hr, that is attainable most of the time."
good,"There was not enough training for the employees to make them successful in their job on task, changes and new process.  The annual review process and system is very unfair."
good,"Constantly changing management makes it difficult for employees to grow. There was also not an opportunity for those who wanted to grow in the organization to do so. In order to advance, you had to know someone."
good,Be prepared to have crazy shift bids and automatic pto to be used without  your permission! Qa  will ding you on every call you received so look out and be aware!
good,"A company moving forward in a competitive industry, great opportunity to grow. Management has improved over my course of employment. A company you can grow with if you choose"
good,"pay was average starting at 11 an hour  "
good,"A fast paced environment that includes daily training for new and tenured employees. Daily coaching and providing assistance to the production team. Daily data entry into the LMS for tracking purposes."
good,Very laidback work atmosphere with friendly and helpful management. Great benefits but too many responsibilities for pay offered. Hard to advance if you are a veteran employee.
good,Manager was fair.  Most managers worked their way up from the bottom from internal promotions.  Assurants benefits used to be good and would offset the lower salaries but now that they have been bought out by Sunlife benefits are horrible.
good,Got to maintain mectrics overall friendly but you have alot of promotions to people who are not necessarily fit for the job enjoy the upper management nice
good,"+ Good dress code of business casual"
good,Busy day from start to finish. Learning labs are useful. Procedural changes could be implemented more efficiently. Challenging but reassuring because necessary tools are accessible to aid in job performance.
good,"Verifying the information we received matched what was in system, if not updating the system. Did special projects. I was on the safety committee and the planning party."
good,"Typical day at work: Meet with SME to gather requirements, daily scrum, backlog grooming and internal meetings"
good,"Working at Assurant was great when it came to the work and my coworkers were great but management is horrible. You'll find a few good people (and you better keep them close, saved my butt once). The turnover rate there is so bad, I've seen so many people come and go there, even genuinely good people. HR does not put the Human in Human Relations, they have no interpersonal communication skills they act like robots and treat everyone like robots too. My advice for any new people there is just be careful I've seen people get fired over things normal jobs who care about their employees would never fire someone over. I would not be surprised if they have hired and fired about half of York County by now."
good,"Great challenge, keep you thinking hat on , excellent opportunity for professional growth. Fast pace n company is growing very fast."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was that it was a Monday to Friday only work schedules and the center closed at 7:00 pm so no late night schedules as well.
good,"I like the job and atmosphere, but management and supervisory team are very prison-like. Makes a person feel uneasy while at work as you are always being watched and looked over. I feel like your input and or feedback are not welcomed. Turn-over rate is extremely high."
good,"a typical work day includes taking about 50-85 calls a day"
good,"Good co workers, but supervisors were very unprofessional. hardest part about this job was the quota that no one ever seemed to reach. unreasonable quota."
good,i learned to work as a team. and i was able to work fast and efficient to pack all the products. i worked very close with my supervisor.
good,"The company has an EXTREMELY high turnover rate. They try to lure you and your friends in with promise of a cash bonus, but this does not make it worth it. The hours are horrible"
good,I enjoyed working for this organization. No two days were alike which made coming to work exciting and stressful at times. The thing they can improve on is creating more structure in order to get in front of some of the issues in order to cut back on fighting fires daily.
good,"oportunidade de aprendizado técnico, gerencial"
good,"Assurant Health was a good place to work, I was there for 11 years, after my first 5 years with the company I went to work at home status, where I continued to work for the last 6 years until Assurant elected to shut their Health insurance business down as of 2016."
good,Interesting place to learn what you can and then take it and apply it elsewhere where you can receive propert payment for your skills
good,"I worked for the company for over 8 years. Started in the retention department and moved to the warranty department. Retention department only cared about your retention rate most of the time. Warranty was better to work in. Definitely example of it's who you know, not what you know in order to advance."
good,Intense focus on sales numbers. Great group of people. This office works well as cohesive unit with the home office in Kansas City.
good,"Assurant is a great company , however there are many unnecessary and sometimes ineffective changes within the customer care department and not a lot of room for advancement . This is a call center job , after a couple years you will get burned out , so take advantage of the tuition reimbursement  while your here and prepare to move on after the 2nd year mark."
good,Assurant is a fast paced work environment with heavy workloads and multiple clients that you will be required to learn and work on a daily basis.
good,I thought that the production was too high to meet. They had available websites that could be used to make the job easier and never got approved even though they worked really good. Management was hard to get a hold of when you need questions answered or to take a phone call. Benefits were ok but expensive coming out of your paycheck and still needed to pay out of your pocket till you met the deductible.
good,"Typical day at work "
good,"A typical day for the last year, was taking calls with customers who had problems with their appliances and they had the warranty plan.."
good,I enjoyed my time at the company great team to work and great location. the only problem is that there is no room for advancement
good,"High call volume busy, learned processing, Insurance claims, how to train other employees co-workers are easy to get along pleasant never had a problem with anyone.  Hardest part of the job is unable to assist the customer. Most enjoyable part of my job is assisting others, and being a party of the Employee Activity Committee planning activities for employees."
good,"I feel the management is awful! Working evening shift, there is rarely an opportunity to move to day shift. They except you to want to work nights forever. Also, other departments are more welling to hire an outsider then hiring within the company. Pay is decent. The people working with you is probably the best part. I work in exceptions processing and the job itself isn't that hard. Moving up in this company at this location is h*ell as far as I can see. Its one of those ""for now jobs."""
good,"I've worked at Assurant for more than 10 years. I knew this was never going to be my forever job or a career for me. I started my schooling while working here. Now that I have graduated it's time to move on. The company has great benefits but there's not much room for advancements in the company, or for pay raises."
good,Answered phone calls and assisted customers in updating required insurance information for their mortgages. I learned what you have to have when you have a mortgage and how to avoid costly lender placed insurance policies.
good,Supervised 8 individuals in the underwriting and cancellation department on our close outs and month ends. Kept deadlines and had great customer service for clients and customers.
good,"on a typical day I work according to the rules set for Tracking Homeowners Insurance to ensure /Client/Customer satisfaction. I work diligently to keep Client Insured for protection as well as the for the bank insurable interest at all times. My co-workers & I are team players helping eachother for understanding of a process, Making payments from escrow in a timely fashion. The demand on a day to day basis of changes or if something comes up to quickly shift of thought process. I enjoy working closely with Agents and Co-workers on procedures making changes or payments  to policies are submitted correctly and timely per  Insured request & keeping them insured at all times whether lender placed or having there own policy."
good,"I love my manager because she deals with every associate on a case-by-case basis. A typical day at work is all about processing. We are mainly making or receiving calls regarding a property loss claim. The name of the game is quality and quantity. These two elements will get your recognized or dismissed. But it's not all bad, because I have come in contact with some truly amazing people and I value my team mates!"
good,"I love my coworkers at Assurant! I work in the Technical Writing Department and both my peers and my supervisors are amazing. Sometimes communication between departments is problematic. I work from home and the pay is amazing, but as a contractor, the benefits are non-existent."
good,"The hardest part of this job is to try to live up to what management wants when they don't even know what is needed.  Training is almost nil, and if you are lucky enough to get into a training class by the time you get on the floor it is not what you were taught."
good,"Approve checks to be endorsed or monitored. "
good,"a day at Assurant is very upbeat with ever changing moods and atmospheres. I have learned a great deal of how to lead and other technical skills related and unrelated to my job. The managers , some are good others are only for them self and you need your upper management to uptrain you for advancement."
good,"You can really feel good when you help customer and they thank you. However, it is thankless because when you are scored on a call, and you do everything to fix the problem, because you did not do something within their call scripting, you failed the call. "
good,"If you have a degree and are young, be prepared.  There are many 20+ year managers and directors that are entrenched in their jobs and advancement is very limited...Pay is average at best;"
good,"This place of employment was great to work for when first hired but as time went on I have come to see that this place is horribly micromanaged. The managers have their favorites and its sort of similar to high school. If you are not a favorite of your managers it is very hard to make a move into a higher position or to a different department. "
good,"A typical day at work for me consist of reviewing loans and making sure that all information is accurate.  I also call insurance companies to verify information. I make payments on escrow accounts and also check non escrow accounts for error.  I document important information on each loan for further processing.   I learned that being on time is very important and also using good time management is important as well.  When you are late for work or calling in then your responsibility falls on your co-workers.   I do not consider my job hard.  I love my job because it allows me the opportunity to display my talent, but I would prefer a career opportunity."
good,"Great team and great benefits. "
good,"My typical work day was a 9-5 schedule, which consisted of customer service duties. This position educated me on credit card insurance and the options available. My management team was great, both professional and approachable. My coworkers were awesome. The most unfortunate circumstance about my job is that our clients were either calling us because they were newly unemployed or disabled. This was a circumstance that had to be handled carefully, however outside of that this was a great atmosphere to work in."
good,Taking stressful calls all day. I learned that the company comes first and the workers that work hard each day can be replaced in an instance. Most of my co-workers were the best people to be around and did their best to lighten things up. The hardest part of the job was not being able to give to the customer the time they needed on the phone and dealing with upset customers all day long. The most enjoyable part of the job was when a customer thanked you for treating them like a human being and taking the time to care. The bad part of that was then you did not make your time per call when you cared about people and that made you expendible down the road.
good,"Call center. Fielding anywhere from 50-100 calls a day. Learned all about Individual Medical health insurance. Management was always available. Co-workers were nice, but we were always very busy. Tried to always make a point of doing food days or incentive programs within the department. Hardest part of the job was dealing with not-so-nice agents at times on the phones. Most enjoyable part was learning all the new information and medical terminology."
good,I had my share of ups and downs while working there. I did enjoy it for the most part. I met some great people and had some great experiences. Management isn't the best but there are some great ones there. The micromanaging is probably the worst part of the job.
good,I don't have any at the moment. This is all I have to say about this company. Give it a try it might work for you. I put a lot of hard work that I was not appreciate for.
good,Due contractual obligations with several companies we administrator the warranties for you are extremely limited in providing good customer service. You are more of a information provider then a  customer service provider.
good,"I have not worked at Assurant in sometime, so therefore I can't say what the work/life culture is currently.  Not sure what the benefits are anymore or what management is like."
good,Starter position. If being on the phones all day long is not for you then I do not recommend working this position. If customer service is what you absolutely love then this may be a good fit.
good,"I have dedicated 7 years of my life to this company and recently a situation took place and how operations management handled it, made me sick to my stomach. The incident was approached in the most humiliating way. For a company that has ""Uncommon Thinking, Uncommon Results"", as a company moto, clearly did not apply any of it."
good,"got hired with the possiblities of being made full time worker, learned different types of losses to homes, how to help homeowners with loss process, very pleasant co-workers"
good,Job is very easy. But poor managament. Management never cared about work moral lie they said they did. Rumors were always going around but great co workers an easy understanding of the work flow.
good,"Worked there for several years, bought out my previous company. Made a lot of staffing cuts and false promises. Work was easy and went relatively quickly, but most people were continuously looking for other jobs just in case another staff cut was made."
good,Assurant is a fast paced environment that is growing.  It is struggling to keep up with technology but they're always looking for ways to improve.  Pay is average for the area.  The supervisors are a fantastic group!
good,Fun and enjoyable job with little to no future opportunities to grow with the company. Good start of job for someone who just graduated from college or that is currently in college.
good,"Its def. not what you know, but who you know. Parking sucks, food there is expensive and ""C"" average at best. but other than that id say its an ok place to work at."
good,"I was not her long, short working hours, relaxed environment.  I was not there long enough to grasp the job duties.  I met some very nice people whom I am still friends with today."
good,Fast paced work environment with a focus on expediency.  Encouraged to take as many incoming phone calls in a given day as possible. Company seemed to care more about quantity over quality.
good,"I have nothing to say about company but really needs to be reevaluated. I feel its under pay,. And having reps work 10 hours only to have a 30 min  lunch."
good,I did not enjoyed being employed at Assurant. I can honestly say that this is the first job that I've every worked for and didn't feel like I was apart a team.
good,The hours for the position I work is 630am - 3pm. We have to process about 20 work items a hour which is fairly easy. The job it self is not hard at all.
good,"Easy repetitive work in a stationary position for 10 hours.   Not much advancement.  Hours are strange.  1st shift 4:45 am - 3:15 pm, 2nd shift 4:30 pm -3:00 am"
good,"I have been working for Assurant for the past 6 months. The job I currently am positioned in is not what I originally was told. The ability to work from home seems to be used Loosely as I was told I could work from home within a month and it's been 6 months, and the thought of work from home is non-existent. I don't feel like all employees thoughts are taken into consideration when it comes to day to day tasks."
good,"Great place to work, however, opportunities beyond Unit Management are slim. It is a very diverse work environment and the company loves to hear ideas from employees."
good,Assurant is a good place to work. It does provide a good work balance depending on which department you work in. Overall the people are nice and the environment is nice.
good,"Teaches you the best way to be for customer service, How to handle customers in the best possible way they could and to some how handle them with resp"
good,I clock in at 7:50 and await on my work to be issued.  I usually have 60 claims to do a day plus take inbound calls from CSR about questions on various claims.  The work can be tricky but you have Team Leads and Seniors available to help you if needed.  I have two breaks and a 30 minute lunch.  I miss friends I met in house but I enjoy the being able to work from home.
good,"Daily routine is supporting the business, focusing on team and application, attending many meetings, committing to target dates, staying on budget, communicating to management, clients, customers, and team needs.  Average 50-60 hours per work week.  on-call 24 hours per day.  Direct upper management needs more focus on their own management team.  Promotion in management difficult.  Hardest part of the job are the constant reorganizations.  My work ethic is of high standards.  I am a people person with involvement with my customers and staff as well as offshore staff."
good,"Good opportunity to learn and understand global insurance products."
good,"Pay and benefits were ok.  Once Assurant took over, then the layoffs started and no one knew if they would be employed.  Have no idea what it is like now.  Some of the managers were borderline tyrants."
good,Good company to work for.  High turnover rates due to inconsistent treatment of employees concerning schedules.  A company where you may join and the key to your success is not to make too many friends and just do your job.
good,This was a call center and the phones were constant.  No time to even get notes in the system before another call came in. Very strict because we represented a bank.
good,Assurant in York PA is a decent place to work at. It has it's ups and downs with work environment and company policies but overall they try to please most of the employees and make it a happier place to work. Turnover rate is a bit crazy but they're working on that as well. One of the major downsides is feeling like you work in a prison. With the security measures and policies in effect to keep their assets safe it can be a bit constraining at times.
good,Really hard for someone to listen to your opinion. Management only picks favorite personal and not the other hard workers. It was hard to advance in the company. Had a great Boss but he was always had his hands tied from upper management
good,"I would recommend this company for most. Full-time company employees make decent money. Benefits are 1:10, 7. Management is HORRIBLE. It's a call center."
good,the best part about working at assurant it to the people are very friendly and helpful. at time it can get crazy when the work load is behind you have to stay in SLA
good,I do a number of things throughout the day. Remitting was my main duty but now my job is Cancels and now apart of Team 7 Que. My level of experience in Salesforce have grown working with the Team 7 which is a huge step. The jib itself is great but I've been here for 3 years as a Temp and was promoted and would like to transition and grow with the company.
good,Our center processed the claims for American Express and I enjoyed speaking with the members and offering assistance with their claims.  There were opportunities for some overtime also.
good,This company always has work but they don't pay enough. This causes the turnover rate to be very high. The worst part of this job was the micro managing. I am always the type to complete my tasks on hand so this made me feel uncomfortable sometimes. The best part of this job is that they would allow some employees to work from home if they met the criteria.
good,Conducting a short survey to the customer to get more information regarding with their bills every month. And answering some inquiries in regards with their lifestyle.
good,Casual environment. Management was positive and workforce is good. Use the latest technologies and  upto date on their systems. Great worklife balance
good,A good place to work with the opportunity to be a part of a team and increase my responsibilities and skill set. Publicly held company with options to purchase stock.
good,"This is by far the worse job experience I have had as a temporary associate. I have been there for a while and still have not been hired on, which seemed unfair because as temporary associate I was training other temps while permanents didn't have to."
good,"Assurant is a very easy job to work, filing customer's insurance claims all day. The job is very monotonous and the pay was pretty low for call center work. It was basically just reading a script and getting answers to specific questions every 3-5 minutes and then dealing with upset customers on occasion."
good,"Nice coworkers. easy worker schedule. Management was ok and we did regular meetings and updates. Not a bad company to work for , just not a lot of room for advancement at the local level"
good,"I really fun place to work I enjoyed my supervisor, she was the only reason to go to work. Very fun and encouraging. If you like being on the phone this is the"
good,"it was by far my favorite job, I unfortunately had to quit because a family member passed away and they didn't offer bereavement for temp agents. the people there are awesome and the job was super easy to get used to."
good,Very busy fast paced call center that handles calls for customers wanting to file claims for there mobile devices. You have to be flexible as far as the schedule but overall the enviornment and the staff are awesome!
good,A typical day at this job was entering homeowners information after damage to their homes. The hardest part about this job was deescalating phone calls. I also was forced to work a lot of overtime when I worked there.
good,I was wmployed with assurant for many years and enjoyed the experience. My manager was great and my job was not difficult to understand and perform. I would recommend other to work for the company
good,typical work day taking claim all day long but they have options of working from home is great. The co workers are great and helpful. benefits are great.
good,Company has been through several changes over the last few years. It was once a company of advancement and growth. It has adopted the do more with less and that can make for a stressful work environment.
good,"Life at Assurant/Sun Life Financial is stressful, really no work life balance, long hours at work. The employees are really nice but overall the workload was too much for the pay."
good,Was fast paced and windowless but it's a job that pays well.  The manager was Stern but not mean and since I was a tempting the chance to go to full time was nice.
good,My supervisor was not  a people person for his position. He didn't get along well with his coworkers which he supervised. The training wasn't that great for the many campaigns we has to work on.
good,"Local bom e descontraído para desenvolver a rotina de trabalho, bons benefícios e plano de carreira."
good,"The job and Department was a good. Loved working with the people, fast paced. Be careful follow all the rules. Management team was OK to work with. Advancement is possible but you must push it."
good,One you get the hang of working here everything comes easy. At first its going to be slow but with time you will advance and every job there is not hard to learn
good,It was a laid back but busy environment. Some of the management was poor. There were changes being made daily within the company that affected everyone.
good,I think this was a good career choice at the time as an claims and Customer Representative. I got a chance to work with people from all walks of life.
good,"work flow just the right pace."
good,"Typical day at work was great. "
good,The job is easy and we work at a quick pace. I get to interact with different customers and help with their needs. The environment is calm and a good atmosphere ins general.
good,Work environment was balanced.  Never had to take work home unless you were a manager. Work hours were between 7am to 6 pm Monday through Friday. Company offered plenty of benefits.
good,"Customer Care Specialist, punch in, work, leave. breaks and lunchess are monitored and frowned upon if late by 1 minute. The schedule is not idea and it is very hard to change."
good,I was hired before the department was ready to use my services and they never really got ready because the manager was too busy to work with me. The facility left everything to be desired and I think was a health hazard.
good,"It's been a few years since I've worked there, but my coworkers were good and smart people.  Management wasn't very open with employees, however, but I've heard they've since had a change of CEO's, so I'm not sure if things have changed."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was the daily opportuity to improves processes and how teams performed jobs and delivered work products.  There was always room for improvement.
good,"Pros: Good benefits, great hours, positive work environment, and very easy job"
good,A normal day at work is usually pretty easy. The work isn't hard but it's not challenging enough. Its the kind of work that's open to all sorts of cultures and and people. Anyone can succeed there. Working 4 10s is the nicest part about being there. Some lower management could use some more trading but the upper leaders can really get people excited about the jobs.
good,Worked in the mail room.  Standing up the whole shift except for lunch and break.  Showed too much favoritism to certain people. Leader didn't explain the job correctly to certain people.  No room for advancement in the mail room.
good,"It is a great place to work as far as being family oriented and flexibility with work schedule. The vacation package is nice; however compensation is below average, growth is slow and management is not the best."
good,"Great place to work, place where advancement is possible is desired."
good,"I've been previously employed by companies who sincerely cared about the mission of the company as well as the success of its employees. Overtime, I have also witnessed this same company's integrity decrease due to poor leadership. I believe that every organization is as strong as it's management team. In order for employees to remain motivated towards success, they need proper guidance. The company i previously worked with is in serious need of leadership training and coaching skills."
good,Good Company. As long as you work hard you will make it here. Great benefits. Typical day involves working on phones and making sure they are in good condition
good,"Gezellig jong team, waarvoor de werkzaamheden als klantcontact hoog in het vaandel staat ondanks de dagelijkse hectiek."
good,"Company did not have good management when it came to work assignments.  Direct manager was difficult to work with and lacked good people skills.  Company has potential to be an awesome place to work, with good pay and benefits, but lack of organization made the job difficult to enjoy."
good,"have nothing good or bad to say about company, was fine at first but everything change every year. Learned a lot and looking to take to a different work place"
good,Great company to work for as long as you are under the type of leadership that really wants to see you develop and grow. Sometimes it can be hard to get promoted.
good,"Overall a great company, limited amount of growth in the organization. There are things that should be changed in the organization to promote the proper individuals to management. The pay is not consistent with the amount of work that is required."
good,great place to learn new skills and the ability to work from home is a great asset. Worked from home for over 5 years. Only go into office about once a month
good,"The culture of Assurant has improved; however, they still have a lot of room for growth. Most employees to not feel supported. There is high manager turnover."
good,"Good company  to start with but as time progresses, start looking to grow with another company. Can be a stressful environment with changes occurring frequently."
good,"At first Assurant seemed like the best place ever to work once you get past the fact that you are kinda under payed for the kind of abuse you endure from their unhappy clientele. Managers and co-workers are supportive. You get benefits, paid time off, pot lucks all the time.. etc. It's like a fun party when you are not taking calls from angry customers. But if they decide for any reason, however petty, that they don't like you, it wont be long before you're gone without a trace. You are being watched whether you know it or not, and they know what they are doing. trust me."
good,Learned alot working here.  Benefits are good. Networking great.  Skills transferrable to other positions in the company and outside the company.  No weekends
good,"no review  every one is different, must make up your mind, fast pace high stress, never boring, no good old boy system your numbers speak for themselves"
good,"Small company. "
good,"great company to work for "
good,This company was more interested in turning out production integrity was frowned upon. They simply wanted workers to work 2 years or less so as not to have to pay any kind of benefits.
good,"Worked for company 11 years. Change is imperative, overall okay place to work, felt secure in job/position, but very few opportunities to advance. Stayed stuck in position for several years. Very hard for me to advance my career, eventually left for career advancement."
good,You never know where you will end up at in this company.  Training provided for all levels provided you knew someone in the company to move up. Its who you know not what you know
good,If you are looking for a diverse work place within the insurance field Assurant Health is the place for you. With everything from onsite underwriters to IT personal Assurant Health has something for everyone.
good,"A typical day at work would be quite strenuous because of work overload, however, it is very easy to manage so as long as one is organized. I have learned numerous positions within this company of how to refurbish a electronic device, and this information is only attainable at a job experience such as this. Management, in my opinion, is poorly structured and should be more organized with each and every department of the facility. I do not believe in making acquaintances nor friends with my co-workers because I prefer a strict business setting, however, if confronted about a situation that pertains to the job itself I will address it properly. The hardest part of the job is most likely being underappreciated by knowledge. I feel, as an individual, that not only does this company respect my eagerness to become more of a beneficial employee, but also does not respect my well being. The most enjoyable part of the job though would be that I get to see new products on the market and refurbish them for many loyal and returning customers."
good,"On any given day you are constantly engaged with employees and customers. The company has done a good job of encouraging continued learning to diversify your skills while broadening your scope of work. Due to regulatory changes the Specialty Property division has undergone some shifts lately resulting in reductions in force. Senior leaders have really encouraged employees to understand a successful change model. There are some great individuals throughout the company.The hardest part of the job is to encourage peers, management, and direct reports during a visible shift and reduction in force. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping employees develop their skill set to better position them for future change."
good,"Taking calls from insurance agents and customers in reference to homeowners policies, updating info., issuing payments on premiums. This position has made me very knowledgeable at the insurance industry and how lenders and insurance companies work together and the importance of insurance. I love a challenge ., the hardest part of my job was learning the insurance ""world""., the most enjoyable was definitely the people I worked with and assisting our customers and getting a bad situation turned around for the positive."
good,My job department duties were to maintain and or retain customers in a credit card protection plan. The job was very fast paced and involved a lot of talking and listening. There were weekly and sometimes daily competitions for the top retainer.
good,"I help assist homeowners with their homeowners insurance, ensuring that they have sufficient coverage. I also aid in any questions they may have, also help with property loss when the customer has a loss with the home."
good,"Short lunch breaks"
good,"This job was very easy for me to learn how to do and allowed me to eventually train others to do what I had learned. Although the work and job duties can sometimes become monotonous and repetitious, the ability to converse with nearby work colleagues makes it easier to more fun to get through the day."
good,I really enjoyed working at Assurant. My typical day was cosmetically and functionally testing new devices that were sent in.  I was really impressed with the open door policy that we had with our supervisor. The genuinely took our suggestions seriously and if it helped with the process they acknowledged the employee that helped implement the new procedure. The hardest part of the job was sitting for 10 hours. I really enjoyed the fact that we worked four ten hour days.
good,"Dealing with agency to verify insurance. I also worked for multiple clients(banks) such as Suntrust, Wellsfargo, chase, and navy federal bank. I verified homeowners insurance on a daily basis."
good,"I worked  here for 5 years , company changed for the better. Compenstation was horrible but I learned a lot in my years here"
good,Typical office environment with the ability to move up. same siturations at most employers hard work and a little luck can take you a long way.
good,Its great for customer service experience high call volume. great for adults in school due to the schedules. No room for advancement.
good,company undergoing too many internal changes. learned a lot about helping homeowners manage escrow accounts. hours at work were inconveniencing for outside living.
good,"Learned about back office operations, worked in a software related to department."
good,"Productive environment to work in with heavy concentration and ability to handle detailed homeowners loans.  Working in the exceptions processing department i have had the opportunity to learn   a great deal from working on the Wells Fargo, and Cenlar mortgage loans."
good,i love the job and what i do at assurant but management makes it difficult at times. always changing rules and never want to compensate anyone for their hard work. they would rather have you doing things that requires higher pay but keep you at a low pay grade but have you doing more work
good,"A typical day in the workplace would be to make phone calls and follow up on loans, making sure everything is up and running with each loan, and keeping things in order."
good,I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the work flow in our department. There was always something new to learn and experience. Would love to work for a similar company.
good,"Extremely busy from the time I walk in straight through until the end of the day, Monday through Friday each day is the same- very busy and you just can not catch up."
good,"I can't say that it is a terrible place to work, because it isn't. It is  clean, and the campus is nice and stocked with some amenities. The technology is always up to date, and many positions have a work from home option. "
good,"Pay rates are low due to this being a staffing agency, did not work in house, I was a contracted employee for a different company."
good,Worked in 3 departments.  Promoted from within.  Great training ground.  Loved the work at home program.  Sorry it's closing.  Hope this is enough words.
good,One of the cleanest places to work. The food in the cafe was great. Overall it was a nice place to be. I don't have anything bad to say about the company.
good,Long hours. Great workload. Management is helpful. Nothing hard about the job. Co-workers are friendly and teamwork is strong. I have learned to build my outstanding customer service skills.
good,I've been with the company for 20+ years and have established relationships with people that I will always cherish.  My department is like a family to me.  I loved my job and life at this company.  It has taught me valuable skills as a Business Analyst including collaborating with others as I got to work with may different areas throughout the company over my time here.
good,"• High outbound calls to achieve solid production"
good,"No room for adavancement "
good,"my typical work day consist of ,, educating and asisting customers with there contract withi the company , also processing payments ..."
good,"Productive, Ive learned computer programs such as Excel, Lotus and Word. Coworkers were great, management was great but in terms of work it was pretty unstable and knowing I need to feed my family I have to be sure about stability."
good,There was a 3 month training period before being assigned to a department. Assurant represents multiple mortgage companies and their clients.
good,"If only this job where to compensate appropriately, then they woud be ideal. This job is basically a Entry Level job dream, but unless you submit or become a sycophant, then you will not excel. At the rate they do compensation and the amount you start off with, it is not enough to support a family, and barely enough to live on."
good,It was a job nothing more. There was room for advancement but it was more so who you know. Okay job but not a career.
good,"Overall, Assurant was a good place to work. The guidelines were almost impossible to meet. The money was good. They never want you to use any of your days for unplanned time off. You are penalized even if you have days available. Emergencies happen."
good,"Develop and attain customer experience and sales objectives for store. Sell all products and services offered by the Company. Meet all sales objectives. Handle all administrative aspects of the sale including: completing customer contracts and warranties, pulling products from inventory, accepting customer payments and filing the completed orders.

good,Company is under going a lot of changes and is growing and acquiring new clientele
good,Great Benefits. Overall the company has a good work life balance.
good,"After only having 3 weeks of training for position due to trainer being sick, we were still expected to take calls like seasoned pros after 1 month. The pay matched the job difficulty, so no complaints there, but expectations for performance was ridiculous."
good,Perfect schedule for people who have little kids.  Have a chance to learn more about Mainframe and Data Center.
good,"I came in as a temp employee and was making a low rate with the promise of a better rate if we were hired full time. "
good,Decent place for work/life balance. Will be an awesome place with better management.
good,"Worked for company over ten years. Management, as well as employees have a high turn over in certain areas.  Did work with my school schedule.  Work is repetitive and not very challenging."
good,Secure job. Hard to advance. Great coworkers. Poor management
good,"I processed homeowner claims for MetLife Home Loans. Which included the duties of documents, document review, ordering inspections, reviewing file for draws of funds to be disbursed to the homeowner for repairs. The job requried a great deal of patience, understanding and empathy in dealing with the homeowners as they were ususally emotional due to various damage to their home. During Hurricane Sandy this was a vital assest to have in dealing with the homeowners, as it was a very stressful time for them. It is a lot easier on both ends when dealing with a delicate situation as that, when the representative tries to find balance and understanding, and to see the job through to the end and done proficiently."
good,"Wasn't able to grow with the business. Mangers were not on the same accord. No teamwork,"
good,"A typical work day consists of logging in and opening all systems that are used daily.  One very vital skill to have as a Processing Specialist is being a self starter.  Our biggest daily goal is to always stay in compliance.  It is achieved by each processor managing his or her own time starting from the beginning of the day.  I have learned how to read large and complex insurance documents for escrow and non escrow home loans.  "
good,Sitting at a work station function testing and Cosmetic checking Handsets that the company purchased for resale.
good,This was my first job out of high school and was overall an okay job. The pay was good and I loved working with the teens and young adults who decided to turn their lives around and make better decisions.
good,"Busy and productive."
good,Working in twg has giving me the opportunity to grow as a professional in my field. Collegues share information and try to put everyone in speed. and Always found a Manager available to hear suggestions and ways to improve work.
good,"Busy, learned a lot from my co-workers, not necessarily my management.  Management is more concerned about the bottom line and not it's customers."
good,Working effectively with integrity to provide awesome customer service to internal customers and to meet the company guide lines I also learned that a happy client becomes a loyal client. I had awesome team players for co-workers the hardest part of my job was trying not to be too compassionate with customers or clients and the most enjoyable part of my job was being compassionate with customers or clients with integrity
good,"Run quotes for agents on the companies that they were submitting for business. Review all applications of the applicants to make sure all information was complete. If not completed would send an email to the agent's assistant with the required information needed. If possible if it was just a address would try to look it up myself. "
good,"To start my day I would work a tech email box to answer questions or receive information from agents of policies in review. I would send the information to be scanned and placed in the electronic files. If the agent would need a certain form I would attach and email it to them. I would than work any policies that were behind schedule and that have been past out by the leads. After that work was completed I would than work the internal replacements and reissues that I had received through the system days prior."
good,Co-workers are committed to quality work.  The health insurance industry is in a challenging time.
good,"Good Company "
good,"Worked Here several years ago. Fun working environment, team goals and potlucks. I learned not to take anything for granted as this company's location was closed down. Management was very open and helpful. Co workers were nice and everyone gave words of encouragement. The hardest part of the job was dealing with irate customers. The most enjoyable was helping customers and getting that feeling of appreciation from the customer, office staff and management alike."
good,A typical day at Assurant was very productive with constant interaction with co-workers.
good,"Working at Assurant was rewarding,because I help people who were in need. I appreciate this company because they have things that most jobs don't have such as a day care , a gym, cafeteria etc. There is opportunity to grow at Assurant if you apply yourself."
good,"Researching payments"
good,"Data entry for mortgage insurance, process renewal documents, cancelations and payments.  I have learned the important of maintaining current property insurance, the difference between escrow and non escrow loans.  As a processor, I have learned that my attention to details helps homeowners maintain current coverage by processing documents accurately.  The hardest part of the job is making an error.  The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to help."
good,Assurant is a nice place to work. I enjoyed the people at the company. 
good,great place to work and a great learning experience and a nice staff
good,Great place to work! Wonderful people around me and the energy is outstanding!
good,"Loved it, was good at it...pay was not what I needed at the time."
good,a typical day consisted of taking phone calls.
good,"No inicio meu trabalho era fomentar o produto Garantia Estendida em clientes Honda e Audi.Após este trabalho fui chamado para realizar implantações em revendas de automoveis, projetos de F&I.E por fim realizei um trabalho de prospecção de novos clientes pois fazia anos que a empresa não realizava isto.Aprendi a lidar com diferentes personalidades de revendedores o que me possibilitou a desenvolver diferentes formas de criar uma proposta comercial customizada.O ambienete de trabalho era bom porém com reclamações constantes pela falta de agilidade da empresa.A parte mais dificil do trabalho era desenvolver alguma tipo de produto e a mais agradavel eram as visitas externas para apresentar o que fazíamos aos propspects"
good,"To keep communication between the customers and various service providers who are performing the repairs for their appliances and updating them on the status of said repairs, handling dispatches for checks to customers (cashing out contracts, providing food lost concessions and service reimbursements), & to provide the upmost customer service and satisfaction to provide a first call resolution"
good,• Assist with client concerns for multiple financial institutions.
good,"I enjoyed working with this company once I went through the laborious training process and got beyond the cliche and favoritisms. Well, never really got beyond them, but it was close to home."
good,This company has great growth potential. I have learned so much with being here. The hardest part of the day is leaving to go home.
good,Updating accounts with customers information. I can not release any information about my company due to legal guidelines
good,As a crontacted company working for a major Credit Card company we were not in the position to make many policy changes that could effect the job we did.
good,The environment was always changing due to leadership evolution of the business.  What started as a domestic oriented operation has grown into an internationally focused company.
good,I loved the people I work with as time passed it became more about numbers and less about people. This is a high production environment that is held to 2% error margin. There is always the threat of disciplinary action for not performing to expectations which may not work for those that don't work well under pressure.
good,This company has majority employees are temporary and seasonal. All highly qualified and simply literate people are kept in single basket. There is lack of transparency in rewards and recognition of employees.
good,"I started working at Assurant on a night shift and left after working on a morning shift in a different building. The average day is pretty consistent. The workplace claims to be a team, but in reality there is not a lot of education about each department and as a result it can be very divided sometimes. The hardest part of my job would have to be my second supervisor. I transferred to another building strictly because of how that supervisor was to me and to the workplace in general. The best part of the job would have to be all of the oprotunity to learn. I love to educate myself and be constantly learning."
good,Managers can run their department as they see fit. Too much favoritism. High turnover.  Inconsistencies in processing procedures. Management determines if you can post out
good,"I work part-time temp, 20 hours per week. Although the pay is decent, it's not enough working part-time. However, I love working from home and my manager is great."
good,"This job was based on sales of credit insurance. Most of the time that customers called in, they were angry and it was my job to try to get them to keep it. Working in this field was very stressful for the pay and I had nightmares about it when I went home at night."
good,"Great place to start a carrier in claims. Many companies today are extremely bent on not allowing even properly trained and qualified individuals into the field unless have ""experience"" ELSE where."
good,"Various amount of call in support depending on what contracts/ or depts. you would be on dependant of that volume, often when one dept. was low for some reason others would be asked to fill in, sometimes with little or no training."
good,"-Providing a competent service to the customers. Policy & claim administrating and claim assessing in line with the company’s standards."
good,It's not assigned workload and/or duties it's the culture of the environment and lack of compensation for your duties that creates the issue lack of promotion and recognition
good,"Reorganizations and poor management have made it a stressful and miserable place to work.  I used to work with a seasoned team, but now people are leaving without even having new jobs.  The design team is still a good place to be, but the deliver and operations staff are working under conditions that are forcing them to leave, just for their own health."
good,This was a long term temporary job that has ended. The culture is somewhat laid back. Dress is casual. Easy access to the interstate. Allowed time off appointments.
good,"review various department QA functions. Learned various departmental processed.  Management can be bias. Diverse culture."
good,"The job itself is very easy however the constant change in teams, schedule and management is hectic. You will literally receive a new schedule a week ahead of time and have to rearrange your whole outside life as far as children and other jobs etc."
good,Pay didnt suit the hours and the hours were crazy long dor the amount of money they were offering. Poor management and the training wasn't clwae enoigh
good,"Absolutely disorganized. They disguise themselves as a flat culture, however, it's very hierarchal and traditional. They are always having changes in the organization and there is high turnover."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with and who worked for me. The hardest part of the job was the instability in upper management and profitability decline as a whole.
good,"While I really loved the people I worked with in my department, the work could get tedious and the management was not great. They weren't very good with appreciation in my department. You didn't have a lot of opportunities for advancement within the department, and the only way to be promoted is to leave the department. "
good,Productive work place.  Benefits were not good as far as 401K and Pension plan.  The pension plan was frozen and was not contributed to any longer.
good,I enjoyed working there with my co workers. It was like a family. The most enjoyable part of my job was getting to work with great people everyday. The hardest part was keeping up with the production numbers daily.
good,"Great coworkers,great customer service office and great food and no job security.I love the environment and the job location."
good,"I thought that Assurant was pleasant to work for. I found that the many changes being made in the company, has to fit someone who is very versatile."
good,"Was constantly challenged and learned many new skills relating to performing the Business Analyst job. It was never boring."
good,"Assurant Health was a hardworking atmosphere the required full attention to detail and disciplined work ethics for fast productivity and turnaround for casework resolution for clients. With the position being a pilot position, the team was very supportive of one another while learning what worked and did not work and also learning how to meet deadlines."
good,Assurant Health is constantly changing and training is always provided with updates. My time here has provided additional expertise that will allow me to add to another company.
good,"I truly believe that it is who you know when it comes to this business, and that is the most difficult part of this job. I have watched as some people who have the same qualifications where one will rise due to their rapport or tenacity and one will not because of either business need, lack of communication or judgement. "
good,"I was very busy during my time on this Assurant project.  They didn't  have their process nor expectations clearly documented, which made it difficult to gain clarity into the project initially."
good,"A typical day in the call center is pretty routine.  You know you will be sitting at a desk and answering telephone calls unless you are on an authorized break or lunch.  However, there is no such thing as a routine call.  I learned how to be patient and really take the time to listen to the callers needs or concerns.  I try to summarize to the caller what I believe their needs are just to make sure  we have the same understanding.  The most enjoyable part of my job was knowing I have really answered all of the customer's questions."
good,"I held various positions due to restructuring including Office Manager, Renewal Manager, Employee Benefits Advisor and Account Manager for a full service, fortune 500 insurance company that provides ancillary benefits. A typical day was working with insurance brokers educating, helping solve complex service issues and building relationships. I traveled extensively around Washington, Oregon, Montana, Idaho and Alaska visiting brokers, cross-selling our products and giving them a person to hold accountable."
good,"My experience at Assurant Specialty Property was enjoyable.  A typical work day for me included many daily, monthly and adhoc reports, planning and coordinating events and supplies. The atmosphere was pleasant and I enjoyed working with my co-workers. I enjoyed the position I had and am very grateful I had the opportunity to work for Assurant."
good,Ive been with the company just short of 2 years and advanced rather quickly thanks to networking. After working hard come raise time I was not handsomely compensated as I had been before. Shortly after the jobs cuts started. The company is going through lots of changes. I once wanted to transfer to the Atlanta corporate office but my future doesn't look as bright as it once did.
good,"Conducted daily/weekly forecasting and planning meetings.  Management allowed flexibility and believed in succession planning for growth and development.  My co-workers were not as team oriented as I would have preferred, however, the associates I managed were team players.  The hardest part was making critical decisions that would satisfy both the company and the client, especially, in regards to corporate advance, claims, or fraud issues.  The most enjoyable part was the overall engagement with the associates, such as team building exercises."
good,"The coworkers were amazing. The team I worked on just flowed to where if someone was having a problem with a customer, it was easy to get assistance. However due to the job being an inbound call center for customer escrow accounts, expect to be cussed out and verbally abused on a daily basis."
good,"A typical day at work for me, will be uploading my computer starting my daily assignments. I begin making numerous of calls to insurance companies & agencies to obtain the necessary information. I've learned that you have to have patients to work in this environment. The hardest part of working in the work place is maintaining patients. The most enjoyable part of my job, are the activities your allowed to participate in."
good,"Assurant is a great company, lots of chances for advancement. Many different aspects of the company, you can learn a lot."
good,Assurant provides a good environment to work in. Most people in Assurant have a long tenure because its a place where people like to stay.
good,"I enjoyed working for the company although, the pay cycles are far and few."
good,I spent majority of my day on the phones. I learned how important customers are. Management was always changing. my co-workers were the best. The hardest part was cleaning up other people mistakes. The most enjoyable was being rewarded for going the extra mile.
good,"enjoyable working with co-workers"
good,"I would log into the phone system and get ready to take calls. I would take from 50 to sometimes 100 calls a day. I learned to multitask and be pro active with stressful customers. I also learned that i am able to reach out to my peers and management at anytime. The managers were always very helpful, and my co-workers were also. The hardest part was keeping my talk time under a certain time limit especially when I had customers that had problems that couldn't be solved quickly. The most enjoyable part was be able to help most customers get everything done."
good,"Daily duties were observed and performed as driven/required by the client. I gained great knowledge of the Mortgage/Hazardous claims process and what takes place where there are catastrophic losses during floods, hurricanes, etc. Teamwork is a strong requirement and maintaining very high levels of production on a daily basis along with Quality Assurance. Learning new processes was a plus while maintaining 100% quality and top performance was a challenge."
good,"I would come in to work two hours early every morning as the company offered unlimited overtime. When my supervisor arrived I would inform her of the work I completed the evening before after her departure as well as the work I completed that morning prior to her arrival. I would make outgoing phone calls to customers and insurance companies as well as receive incoming calls from clients and customers. I would update hazardous insurance policies and provide customers by assisting with their inquiries. I was able to learn about different types of insurance policies, coverage, premium, companies, and laws and regulations of policies for different states. At the end of the day I would stay at least two hours overtime and complete policies that the company was behind on updating. I also was asked to come in on Saturdays for six hours overtime every week to complete all policies that were about to fall behind. My coworkers did not do as much overtime as myself but they were enjoyable to work with and laughter was heard often."
good,"Though there were many great things about working at Assurant, the practice of hiring too many people and then doing lay offs was disconcerting. I enjoyed the people I worked with and the ever changing environment. It was nice to go to work and learn something new or have a new experience daily. The open door policy, which meant you could walk in and talk to the site director, was a refreshing change to most places. The compensation was not as much as one would hope, but it was one of the higher paying unskilled jobs."
good,"I come into work and sit down to take calls all day, 9-3, and get a break. I have learned that to speak to someone without seeing them is harder than face to face. The Management is very helpful and full of good nature. My co-workers don't typically speak to me socially. The hardest part is not being able to help someone as it may break procedure. The most enjoyable is talking to people all day."
good,I enjoyed the time I been there working for the company. Would go back and work for the company if was given the opportunity to.
good,Job security but systems and programs need to be updated. System issues make it difficult to perform you job to the best of your ability especially if you are on production.
good,A freeze on pay rate.  They ratre you by how fast you work and to much proceesing.  Not enough employees and more arr leaving.  But other dept maybe better.  They keep you on system tracking. You have to type in Everything you do
good,"I was at Assurant for 13 years. When I first started the job, and for the next 3 years, the job was exciting and I kept moving up within the ranks. Then, the changes in management started to cause a major decline in morale. Then the ""re-org"" caused multiple layoffs which would continue around the holidays/end of the year for the next decade. This pressure caused several people to look elsewhere and when they were gone those job responsibilities were passed on to the others in the department instead of filling the vacated position. The people who remain are over worked, under paid and never rewarded or appreciated. 13 years of upwards of 60 hours per week and was stuck at the same pay grade even after jumping through every hoop they asked and more. I stuck around because I had put so much of my heart and soul into the job, the insurance benefits were excellent and I was able to telecommute. I didn't survive the last layoff event. I have to say that being laid off was a blessing in disguise. I can finally breathe again."
good,Secure facility. Certain position given the opportunity to work from home. Individualizedd work experience. It is what you make it. You set your own goals and live up to the standards you go after.
good,Management inconsistent- some truly concerened/interested in employees; others strictly focused on client metrics- new hire began seizing during nesting period; the very next question management member asked after how the person was doing was how are the calls going.
good,Over all a very good company to work for. Easy and laid back. Only down side is lack of hours in off seasons. Co workers are friendly. managers are attentive and knowledgeable. If your looking for easy work as a regular associate I recommend.
good,To start in the mortgage industry the company is great but very stressful you have to meet or exceed your metric to get a raise by the end of each year .
good,"Assurant as a whole is a great company but do NOT work in the OPEN ITEMS DEPARTMENT. Management is either RUDE, or does not know what they are doing. You have to be part of a ""click"" to get your fair share in that department. The pay STINKS for what they want you to do. There is no room for advancement in that department neither."
good,"Assurant was great in terms of paying for my education, and allowing me opportunities to change positions/find advancement. Unfortunately the pay is quite poor, and annual raises are substandard at best. It was only through continual career advancement/promotions that I managed to raise myself to a level of pay that allowed me to earn a decent salary."
good,I loved my job at Assurant but the hours didn't allow me to find child care unfortunately. I would definitely work there again given the opportunity. All the supervisors were very supportive.
good,"Assurant continues to benefit from its yester-year stellar reputation as a stable company that pays slightly lower in a pay-it-forward mentality where employees benefit in the long run."
good,"New managers and they are two clicks and if you aren't part of one hard to fit in. My position job knowledge, longevity and skill doesn't matter you are easily replaced. 10 years no disciplinary actions, one incident and no chance let go even though top performer."
good,"I was with this company for over 31 years and took early retirement to be a caregiver.  The original owners treated the company like family. When we went public again, there was lots of pressure to meet stockholder's expectations.  It was a good company to work for and I enjoyed my time there.  I still hold stock in the company."
good,Assurant get's an A for effort trying to upgrade it's technology but the acquisition management and role out of technology applications are less than efficient.
good,"Good place to work."
good,"Lots of hours spent sitting at a computer. Lots of other employees, but you work independently. Long hours but nice environment. The employees were nice but the management was a little hard to work with."
good,"This company can provide good income and benefits, but can be extremely stressful. At this place, I was constantly busy and stressed out by ever increasing goals that became extremely difficult to meet."
good,Adapt to new work environments in a timely manner multitask and learn different opportunities learn new cultures meet new people from different variety of ethnicity .
good,"Great place to work. Great atmosphere. Secured building. Three sites so availability to move. Flexible schedules."
good,"overall its a very good company as per my experience ,work culture was good ,managers were vry friendly .every friday managers organized different types of games where we enjoyed a lot.it was my first company where i did stretch shift that was my tough day around 16 hours shift.manageent was very good ."
good,Out of any job I've had this has been one of my favorites as it involved technical support of computers and peripheral equipment such as digital cameras and printers. This is the one job that I learned the most about computer hardware and software beyond my own personal interests and research/learning. Also I really enjoyed the troubleshooting aspect because I like being able to help people solve problems.
good,"Working days were always varied and being an international company the working day could be long due the meetings etc in different work zones. The local teams I worked with were more like friends that business associates, the company gives you the opportunity to progress and make a positive contribution to the organisation and this is rewarded."
good,A typical work day is ensuring the customers are satisfied going above and beyond to provide excellent customer service. Assisting and training current and new hire employees.
good,"Assurant was a good company overall.  The work hours were flexible, Work From Home, Relocation, Part Time, Flex Time were all good options and very accommodating.  During the time I was there, I obtained my Associates and Bachelor degree as well as my Agent license.  All of which were reimbursed by Assurant at a minimum of  50%.  Management was average.  They hired a lot of Mid-Management based on who they liked rather than experience, knowledge of the job or education.   My Co-workers, for the most part, long-term,loyal,hardworking and friendly.  The Hardest part of the job was dealing with favoritism in the hiring process and getting over the learning curve of new management.  Most enjoyable; Yearly bonus, strong benefits, company events, Work From Home, advancement opportunities."
good,"A typical day included working in a high volume and fast paced workplace. "
good,"I've worked at Assurant for almost a year now. It's not the worst job i've ever had. I feel I do much more than what I am being paid for. I run sometimes 3 separate departments by myself for my entire 12 and a half hour shift. The supervisors i've had have been wonderful. I've really enjoyed working for them. I could not ask for better co-workers. They're all fantastic, and I feel like we're a small family. I just wish I could have met them in a different place."
good,"friendly atmosphere, hard working co workers."
good,"Third party processor for worker's compensation claims. Daily processing of work comp claims for insurers. Production and accuracy was key. Co-workers were friendly and always willing to help. Open door policy with manager was welcoming. At times too much overtime was required. Outside of the box thinking as sometimes team meetings were held elsewhere, i.e. parks, to boost moral."
good,Corporate America at its best. Work days are as is any other company. Great place to work all you want to do is bring home a pay check.
good,"A typical day would be going over mortgage loans and checking the figures, to find out why there is either a shortage or overage in the escrow and documenting the findings. "
good,"The company is a nice place to work, but after one year I started to realize its not as easy to move up as explained. This is a call center and there is change, however some change is not always good. Overall the people here are nice and this is the perfect job if you would like to be in one job title for a little while."
good,"The company itself is great, but the management is awful.  It has an atmosphere similar to that of being in high school; for example most, not all the management have really close friendship ties to each other therefore if you get on one of their bad sides, the others turn on you like little kids.  Most of the management would rather carry on personal conversations with themselves then to be available for someone to come ask questions. The training manual has so many gray areas, that the only thing an associate can do is take the word of their current manager, however if you change manager the rules may change as well. No consistency at all."
good,A typical day at work is an important role of quality in the products we send out to our customers. I enjoy the laid back work place but also maintain a strong work ethic.
good,you get hands on training fast past. They require alot out of you
good,"Assurant is a good company to work for if you don't mind being at a desk and working on a computer all day. The work can be interesting depending on the department you're working in but the best quality about that company is the job security and the benefits. I recommend it to anyone who is looking for something with a set schedule, reasonable pay and vacation time as well as insurance, etc."
good,This is a great company. Unfortunately they are experiencing many cutbacks and financial loss with the economy thus creating a glass ceiling for advancement.
good,Good atmosphere at work.  Annual reviews.  But no room for advancement.
good,It was great experience that exposed me to SQL. It was challenging but it helped exposed me to alot of Business reporting.
good,"I get to work with a lot of great people, however I have outgrown the job and there is no room for advancement."
good,"Slow in the mornings, then calls pick up the closer it gets to midday. I learned to treat others the way I would like to be treated. The management was great, the co-workers where a joy to work with on and off the clock. All-in-all was a great company to work for but there was times that they forgot you had an outside life."
good,There is job security here at Assurant. The company is the industry leader and is still growing. Advancement can be a challenge but overall the company is a good company to work for.
good,"Not a bad job. No real room for advancement as managers and leadership is pretty young and probably not going anywhere. Answer calls, process claims ... co-workers are friendly and nice."
good,"Assurant is a great place to work.  It is full of diverse and hardworking individuals from all backgrounds.  The work can be challenging at times, but in my experience all teams do indeed come together to get the job done.  On the downside, there are frequent layoffs, and these are often unpredictable.  Securing a great salary at Assurant will, as is common in the corporate sector, place you at the front of the layoff list, regardless of performance.  In 3 years, there have been ~4 rounds of layoffs."
good,"Didn't have good training on all computer platforms. Teacher was planning her own training business trip instead of teaching."
good,"I absolutely loved my team. Everyone from my Unit Manager down was incredibly kind. As a Processor you are required to take information from insurance documents and type them into a software program called Black Knight. You're expected to do 18 documents an hour. It sounds daunting at first but at the end of my time there I was doing over 40 an hour. "
good,"Very high turnover rate in the call center due to the stress of the job. Little room for error, confidential information can be given unless you use precaution and are 100% aware of who you are speaking with/what you are able to say to them."
good,"The work was high paced but the environment was acceptable. there was a constant changing of management and at one point I was more qualified than the supervisor they hired in above me. I spent a lot of time explaining my job, how it worked, and how I maintained goals to staff that had no idea of what I did even after writing it down step by step several times. But all in all, I did well with the culture and pay was adequate for the work performed."
good,"very fast paced and stressful, when you are reviving 70+ plus calls from home owners who are devastated and have lost their home and sometimes family it take a toll on your mental stability."
good,"If you're not okay with work being slow, I wouldn't recommend working here. Depending on where you work at assurant, the work is very slow. The supervisors are very understanding and lenient. After 90 days you're able to take off more without getting points."
good,supervisors didn't want to listen to employees and when you ask a supervisor a question they disregard what you said and took it to their boss. their boss in return wouldn't listen to either. They tell you to go through the chain of command but doing the chain of command gets you nowhere. they will fire you on the drop of a dime and they don't really care about their employees or their customers. they say quality over quantity but when you are working there they want quantity over quality. if you didn't meet your day quota you got fired after 3 warnings. when you are new they choose to believe the people who are their longer then the new employee  causing issues in the future for the employee.
good,New management is relying on consulting firms to steer the company instead of the decades of customer data.  It looks like the company is working towards putting out the for sale sign
good,"Good place to work, management is good, not great but good, salary scale could be better, no much place to advance in some departments, community culture very good"
good,"Company constantly evaluates it's business to remain competitive. This is a good thing. Great benefits, pay is average. Employee base is largely hourly."
good,"Supportive management, although we worked remotely, they kept us informed of most changes and updates in a timely manner. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers during their most difficult times and working from home."
good,A work day consist of processing claims. Learned the importance of thorough review and research dealing with different federal and state mandates. Co-workers and management were good people.
good,Assurant offers wonderful benefits to its employees and has a great culture to work for.  Hopefully Assurant will be purchased and employees will get to keep their jobs.
good,"Travail à temps partiel le matin uniquement."
good,"I enjoyed working for Assurant. It is a professional environment which challenged me daily. What I enjoyed most was the constant learning, changing, and growing."
good,My position at Assurant is definitely fast paced and it keeps one on one's toes. I've learned how to operate successfully in a call center environment which means learning how to multitask. Management is very helpful but not always readily available to assist so there is a lot of research and learning on your own. Coworkers provide a sense of camaraderie and support emotionally. The hardest part of the job could be long hours and not finding appropriate support but the most enjoyable part of the job is the satisfaction of problem solving within a short amount of time.
good,"Four 10hour days a week.  Sitting for the 10 hour shift taking apart, fixing up, testing cell phones.  Great co-workers everyone is very friendly.  Managing could be improved."
good,learned how to process mortgage loans for CitiMortgage Bank and CitiBank
good,I wasn't very happy because of the extremely long work hrs and there was always a problem for me to be able to take the lunch brake.
good,I enjoyed working at Assurant for 3 years. I worked from home and the company paid a bonus for the first years but later discontinued that bonus and laid off adjusters and managers as the housing market stabilized. I was told I might be laid off 3 times if the claim volume didn't improve before I left the company.
good,Very good benefits. Wages are decent. Very fast paced environment. Must keep quality and quantity at all times. High turn over rate. Lots of room to move up
good,"I like my job and appreciate learning everything about insurance, loans, escrow accounts and how to read homeowners policies.  To have that type of experience is a big deal for me.  I would like to move on and learn other job responsibilities.  That doesn't seem to happen anymore.  Management lacks prepping or encouraging growth among their employees.  There are no open door policies within the company.  They have added impossible time restraints on duties that are impossible to meet.  The culture is like being in high school."
good,"A work day at Assurant is long and repetitive although being there has taught me to work better with spread sheets and excel files, its not a fast paced job until you get orders in at last minute that becomes more frustrating then anything, The communication there between well everyone, Staff, Supervisors, The Sales team, and everyone in between is almost non existent."
good,Assurant Health was a great place to work  however the company is closing.  People were the best part of the job as we worked together to just get the job done on a daily basis.  Will miss all the great people.
good,There was always work and very easy to do. It was very fast paced and coworkers were all around you to help if needed. Management was always not far from you and was always on top of things.
good,"lots of benefits, nice staff, would recommend to anybody wanting to apply for this role, would suit somebody starting off in customer service"
good,Assurant is for sale or closing. Not much opportunity for advancement at this point and that is the only reason I accepted the position.
good,Assurant offers mostly remote positions. Assurant has a very diverse atmosphere for there employees.They offer great benefits and their is room to grow within the company.
good,"It’s a typical 9-to-5, give or take a few hours. I was a mobile insurance customer service specialist and all day every day all I did was handle so phone insurance claims. When I inquired about advancement, I was told that I had to speak to the woman managing our contract employees, she referred me back to Managment saying that they had final say over who was turned into full-time employees of Assurant. It’s a great entry job, CSR, however you have to be wise with who you choose to ego boost, increases potentially being brought on full-time. I left to pursue a higher paying job in a similar field."
good,Job seems amazing in the beginning until they dump you with a crazy amount of work without proper training. They will push as much work as they can on you
good,So I clock in from the time I clock until my last break I am on the phone other than my two breaks a day and lunch. So times I wish it was where we were not stuck to our desk and to the phone.
good,"Worked within corporate IT department as an analyst. Good work-life balance due to slow paced work. Experience depends on culture of your specific department / team, mine was favorable."
good,Assurant really appreciates their employees. Management could use more work. Its an amazing job overall. I love the company and what they do for their clients. Management team could be better.
good,"Answer more than 60 calls a day..."
good,The company is a well known entity with great values and goals for customer driven.
good,"Arrive at work about 30 mins before start time."
good,"You are trained on the job you are hired to do, it is a fast pace environment with having to meet quotas.  "
good,"I Love working in a upbeat, enthusiastic, always happy work environment. I have to run daily reports, manage a small team of 15 associates, pass out candy, donuts, food on occasions. I love working smart not hard."
good,I worked part time in the customer claim department. took inbound calls from clientsa and home owners. The amnagement was always by your side when you needed them. Co workers was helpful also. The hardest part was dealing with rude customers and making sure you solve their problem correctly. I enjoyed learning new things.
good,Was a rapid test inspector it really got competitive but I like being at least in the top three of my workmates. Most of my coworkers are good people and great workers.
good,I would test the cellphones to ensure the phone would be operational  ensure the phones would take pictures and work properly for the customers. I enjoyed my job.
good,Assurant is regulated by various government bodies and therefore is in a constant state of change; it is a very dynamic and demanding place to work.
good,"These individuals are responsible mainly for taking orders, logging customer complaints and concerns, and explaining details about a product or service."
good,My first supervisor received a Wells Notice from the SEC.  He was dismissed and there was no one available to run the unit who knew how to deal with the unit.
good,My department works remote therefore waking up logging in and starting your day is simple. I've learned the insurance process as well as how to audit from start to end. The hardest part is having no personal interaction with your team.  Assurant is a fast paced environment as well as a self taught atmosphere.
good,"A very busy company, mandatory overtime for 9 months of the year, not much room for advancement. Employees receive full benefits (PTO, health insurance, 401k). There is poor communication between management of different departments, and causes issues in efficiency as a result."
good,Clueless management. Stubborn individuals. Embrace change is suppose 2 be one of Assurants core values but the management team doesnt acknowledge that!
good,"Loved the department activities, they allowed you to expand your network and learn about the company. Health insurance was expensive and not worth it since you have to meet all your deductibles first before it covered your claim."
good,Answering multiple inbound calls. Updating customer accounts in a detailed and accurate manner. Resolving customer issues accurately within a timely manner to  meet required quality standards and requirements. I have gained valuable customer service skills within this fast pace environment. I am able to navigate the customer account with speed and accuracy. I am able to resolve complex issues and provide uncommon customer service to each and every customer I speak with on a daily basis.
good,hours are 7-4pm. Day starts stressful and ends stressful. Always more work than employees. Poor management. Underpaid and a very stressful environment.
good,"everyone at Assurant is big on ""networking"" which basically means however your manager feels about you they will tell everyone if you try to transfer. Some days my manager loves me and boosts about me and then other days I do everything wrong and I'm the worst employee ever. Truth of the matter is when I try to transfer out of the deptment  to better myself for a better position she gets salty and then treats me different. So who knows what she has said about me cause I have not been able to transfer out since I have on her team. But had transferred twice prior to being on her team."
good,"Assurant overall is a great place to work, pay is fair, work/life balance is a little off, but overall all is well.  I wish them well , I learned a lot."
good,"Working for Assurant and being place with the patient that I took care of was a fun, interesting time. "
good,Management constantly fluctuating. Environment always in hyper mode. Moving from one emergency to the next. Lack of usable and positive communication on all levels
good,It's overall an ok company. Needs better management and systems for employees to work with. They have a lot of group participating events for employees to get involved in on their downtime.
good,I work at the front desk and check visitors in and out. I'm looking for something closer to home. I love working at Assurant. All the employees treat me special.
good,"I feel that Assurant is a great place to a work, however, I do not feel the compensation is competitive. I worked as a Processing Specialist, and I loved it, because I learned so much about the Insurance business. The workplace culture was ok, the most enjoyable part was meeting new people"
good,"So many negative changes have made the claims department  a toxic and disheartening place to work.  A few years back, it was a great place to work.  There was a sense of community and hard work was appreciated.  Since the arrival of new claims leadership, the department has suffered significantly, with a high turnover of good, experienced employees, replacing them with inexperienced,  entry-level ""yes men""."
good,"I had lots of fun and laughs"
good,As a caretaker you befriend the client and assist with day to day activities. Each client is different but you assist in changing and meal prep. Make sure medicine is administered and watch over the client.
good,It's a great company to work for.  The company offers opportunities to learn different areas within the company.  There is constant change within the company that can increase growth and opportunity within the company.
good,"Assurant overall is full of great people, and a great company to work for. I have learned a tremendous amount about insurance, banking, lender placed insurance; however I am ready for a change."
good,"Assurant was a great place to work.   I learned how to process draw checks for policy holders against their homeowners insurance.  There was always plenty of work to do and the toughest part of the job was completing and processing all the checks that came in for the day.  There were time constraints and all the work had to be completed before the days end, especially the ones that were being  Fed Exed out.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the most challenging, knowing you had to get everything done by 3pm."
good,"It was a job and I was thankful everyday for the job, I was blessed with."
good,"Management does little to assist when employees struggle to meet metrics, and offer more negative feedback than positive. My  co-workers, however, are a good bunch who try and support each other."
good,Compensation/Benefits and Job Security were rated low due to assignment was temporary and benefits were not offered to agency  employees. Cons included representation of numerous clients without receiving compensation for addition intellectual capital.
good,"A typical call centre really. Very pushy about hitting targets, and being constantly watched and checked on, made for quite uncomfortable working practises.  This led to very high staff turnover."
good,"Good job for someone with no goals, and living at home.  Someone with family and responsibilities this job is a waste of time because of the income and chance of advancement."
good,"Friendly environment the people were extremely nice. I would recommend to go back but not through a temporary agency, straight in the door to make more money."
good,Assurant was a great company to be at. The culture was great. If you made sure you met your data entry quota you would be fine. The environment was great.
good,"Assurant is a company listed on the Fortune 500. It provides the benefits that big companies have. It has health and dental insurance. The teams have about 10 people same rank doing the job you do. Unfortunately, the quality of Team leads and Unit managers is very uncertain. I have served under many in the near 10 year of experience with the company. This company can be a positive experience, but it can also be a tough one."
good,"OK. Needs to have management on all levels on the same page. Too much politics"
good,"Assurant has a good job culture and a good work/life balance, and overall is a good company to work for. From location to location Assurant is very uniform when it comes to their processes and structure."
good,"I worked through a temp agency for Assurant Specialty Property. The company wa snot bad to work for, as I have had much experience in the call center environment (over 10 years). The client I worked for was very misleading and unprofessional in my opinion which jades some of my review here. My position demanded that I review the details of past & current homeowner's insurance claims and to complete different tasks to help the push the claim along. Most of the time there were simple documents that the homeowner needed to sign or the contractor who rebuilt the home needed to sign. Sometimes checks needed to be endorsed or were loss. Sometimes, due to a disagreement or a contractor walking off a job there were disputes. Sometimes, lawsuits. There were different scenarios. All in all, the job wasn't difficult. It just took someone who needed to be detail oriented & didn't mind reading between the lines. However, there were mounting problems on the Assurant end as well. Lots of miscommunication between the higher ups I think was the biggest issues, because the rules of what was acceptable or not were in a constant state of flux. Imagine asking a senior employee a question, getting an answer and then being told that answer was wrong... which happened a lot. Due to the nature of the client actually being investigated for improper business actions, this definitely would contribute to the confusion. However, I think that even in times of confusion, middle & upper management should conclude on exact processes.Again, this could've been just the client I worked for , as there are different"
good,"A typical day at Assurant consisted of answering call from customers or insurance agents. Explaining letter received, or to insure the correct policy information is on file and the payment is made for the policy on time. I've learned a lot about what you type of protection you should have when you purchase a new home with a mortgage. Management was helpful to a certain point. My co-workers were helpful as well. They hardest part of the job was having to process any corporate reimbursement for mistakes made on the customer's account. The most enjoyable part of the job was when it was a teammates birthday and we decorate the desk and provided them with gifts. Most of all it was comfortable environment to work in."
good,"Good benefits for a high deductible ppo plan.  The actual work was easy just time consuming.  Exceeded numbers so much that management decided to move production from 88/day to 120.  Pay is okay, could be better."
good,A typical day would be making outbound calls and networking with lther departments that deal with home warranties. I learned that you have to watch your back and people would try to get rid of you if they feel like you are a threat. Management is lazy and doesn't want to cooperate. Co-workers gossip. The hardest part is being in a place where people hate you and yet you have to smile. The most enjoyable part is that I had chance to help people.
good,"Great company, hard to progress after you reach the UM level, extremely hard to progress after you reach the OM level. Wonderful people at Assurant, fun culture."
good,Good company but people are not good. Lot of work pressure . Need to balance life with off shore teams. Management has changed and they are not good..
good,"Encourage employees to take on different responsibilities outside their daily tasks. Push employees to create challenging stretch goals.Surprise employees by bringing in coffee, snacks and catering lunch"
good,"Depends on department you work in. Assurant offers multiple sports teams, a great cafeteria, a decent benefits package, and a playroom with air hockey, corn hole, etc. There are a lot of perks to working here."
good,Assurant is a great job to apply and work for great benefits good pay plus little raffles you can participate in if u want like cowboy tickets paid time off flat screen tvs its a great job fun people everybody is very nice highly recommend to apply
good,I love the work I do at assurant but I feel the compensation does not meet the work demand. You will receive more and more work and clients but will not be compensated for the more work you’re doing. Advancement within the company is tough which makes it frustrating at times.
good,"Overall Assurant is a good place to work. They have benefits (health, dental, life, short and long disability, 401K). The environment in each unit differs with the management. I was fortunate to work with good managers. Each had their own style. I didn't like the lack of communication that sometimes occurred when changes to procedures were made. Some departments ""got the memo"", other didn't. Also, if you decided to work with this company be prepared to adapt to changes that will come. Departments can be restructured at any time."
good,"Cell phone warehouse shipping phones. Met great coworkers, managers and other managers that weren't my manager. Easy but a lot of work. Overtime opportunities."
good,Fun job due to my experience and knowing how to provision phones for agents in office and work from home. Co workers enjoyed helping me learn the job.
good,I have been at Assurant for 16 years. They offer benefits and paid vacation. Managers are great and associates are like family.  Just time to move on.
good,"Dealing with client queries/requests, being involved in on-going and new projects, collating MI, reviewing data to understand trends. Most importantly communicating with internal and external stakeholders, managing expectations as well as building new relationships and improving existing relationships."
good,"While the work itself was sometimes stressful and overwhelming, the workplace offers a relaxing oasis for breaks. Additionally you're given plenty of discounts to local donut shops and resturaunts. The managers are friendly and willing to work with you to build your skills."
good,I worked for an arm of the company that is no longer in business.  I'm not sure what else I can say about a company that no longer exists.  I'm not sure a review would make an impact.
good,I like to be productive and busy. This  company gives you that opportunity. It gives you the opportunity to progress within the company. The company recognized a job well done and give out rewards for many different things.
good,"Assurant was a great place to work, there's an opportunity to work with & meet great people, the only negative was that for advancing your career it's about who you know not what you know."
good,"Often had company sponsored lunch food, job is fast paced with quotas per shift, I am the line lead and also head up the medical response team. I train new employees."
good,"Decent place to work until shutdown by healthcare reform.  Certain departments were great, others were poor, all depended on leadership of that particular area."
good,"I would recommend to anyone about the phenomenal work environment and opportunities that they have to offer. A diverse, cultivating culture, Assurant is an awesome place to work."
good,"Job work/life balance  good"
good,"Great up and coming employer with horrible management, bad people skills and unreliable employees. Company is said to be closing its doors soon. Proceed with caution."
good,The pay is ok. The work is very easy. The people I work with are great............................................................................................Management is good. stable employment as long as you do what you're suppose to do.
good,Enjoyed guiding homeowners with steps on how to complete necessary documents to begin process of issuing home insurance funds to begin home repairs. Diffusing irrate callers on a daily basis.
good,"If you are into quality of work and you don't mind meeting quotas then this is a job for you."
good,"I worked at Assurant during the early 00's when their health insurance business was thriving. Was able to navigate career and gain a lot of valuable experience from former big-x consultant employees. Overall, good."
good,Nice place to work! Very easy to learn and work with the team. Managers are nice and want to see you grow. Definitely recommend applying for a position with the company.
good,"On a typical day, I would process the loss drafts checks that came from the insurance companies. Once done with that, I would assist in processing the checks that went to the customers so that they could repair their property.  I occasionally had to call insurance companies as well as customers to get information about the claim/claim check.  The hardest part of my job was listening to the customers call in with devastating news about how and why they needed to file a claim for property damage."
good,"I loved working at Assurant, i met some wonderful and helpful people. I was able to improve some of my abilities through them and I was constantly learning new things."
good,"This was a nice place to work until the CEO decided the Assurant Health business wasn't making him enough profit, shuttered it, blamed Obamacare, and laid off all 1,200 employees. Other than that, though..."
good,"Fast-paced, deadline-driven environment.  Flexible work schedule.  Supportive and professional management.  Really focused on doing the right thing for our customers."
good,"The Milwaukee office is closing.  It is getting out of the health insurance business.  Not much more to say, other than that it was a good company with good people."
good,"For the most part the company is a great, the management could have been a bit more organized, but that would be the only complain, everything else was pretty great."
good,"Management was great, the job although stressful was fulfilling, the dress code and environment was professional to semi-professional.  We could earn or purchase passes to dress casual, the proceeds from those sales went to the huge company Christmas party at the end of the year.  Constantly had bake sales, and potlucks going on by various depts., and groups.  They sponsored huge benefit drives, and we raised money for various non-profit organizations, ( red cross, united way, etc.)   Environment of constant learning with team building seminars, and personal growth seminars.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with customers who felt as if they were wronged by the company, the most enjoyable part was calming and explaining to the same customer the program and how it worked and allowing them to see step by step that the program is actually built to benefit them.   Making a happy customer gave me joy."
good,"Assurant develops and offers specialty, niche insurance products. It's a unique experience in financial services. The company has recently gone through a lot of change with new leadership and the selling of large businesses."
good,This is a Christina based environment to work for.  Every task is handled professionally while on the job and away from the job.
good,"Busy, maintain a constant flow of work, my quality is excellent.  I speak to clients on a daily basis, my co-workers are competent and we have a very professional environment.  Hardest part is sometimes getting clients to agree.  The easiest part of my job is that I like what I do."
good,"A typical day is split between managing the day to day flow of the teams and problem solving new issues. We are in the process of implementing new formal processes in all areas. These require continual refinement. Each day presents learning opportunities in multiple ways. I strive to improve the effectiveness of my management technique with this new knowledge. My co-workers are hard working, dedicated professionals! The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing the accomplishments achieved by the associates around me."
good,"Boa para trabalhar, mas pessoas despreparadas assumindo cargo de supervisão atrapalha o rendimento da equipe."
good,"Assurant Health was a good company to work for. Like most companies it had its pros and cons. One thing that stands out is that they offered a good compensation & benefits package. Due to this company closing by the end of 2016, my review would null and void."
good,A typical day at Assurant usually starts off with 30+ customer service calls for the first part of the morning regarding property taxes and Escrow accounts for Nation Star Mortgage. I was required to monitor Escrow accounts for clients and help them resolve any issues that could potentially compromise their homes. Manage was very understanding an helpful when it came to a problem I could not resolve on my own. Co-workers were fun and helpful as well. The hardest part of the job was the rude customers at times and the customers the were about to lose their homes and I couldn't do anything to help them. The most enjoyable part of the job was the incentives we would receive for good customer service and the free lunch every Monday.
good,"Work environment is good , higher people always help to others. Really enjoyed to work in assurant account. We used to work on Assurant solutions."
good,"A typical day at Assurant is very busy I come in each morning check my emails, go over the workflow assigned for the day and go from there. Each day can be different depending on the needs of the department I specialize in tax research and customers request. I update tax amounts when needed, make calls out to the tax professionals to get further information. Homeowners call for all kinds of reasons to have analysis ran, to have there taxes or insurance paid updated ext., it is my specialty to complete their request. I get along great with al my co workers we work together to complete all the loans in a timely matter."
good,"Tipical day at work , assemble and fix phones, boxes , modems. Cant remember much it was a long time ago and a short amount of time."
good,"on an average day we areexpected to answer as many calls as we can and reslove ascomplaints when they are brought to our attention and help making the customers experience a good one. i regually make team games and incentives to help motivate and challenge my team members and help keep their minds on the tasks ahead."
good,call center atmosphere - very performance statistics oriented - volumes of details to learn - hardest part of the day was dealing with rude customers - but other customers were a pleasure to assist
good,"Overall my time at a Assurant was a great, management can be very difficult and at times hard to deal with, if you are looking for a steady paycheck then that is that place for you."
good,"Very good company to work for. I will be getting laid-off soon after 15 years because company is going out of business. However, my overall experience with Assurant Health has been a positive one. I love the fact that I have been able to work from home over the last few years. I will miss working for them."
good,"It is a who you know environment for promotions.  The company is great to work for, management lacks the core values that Assurant strives for.   Many incentives given by the company such as tuition assistance and pensions.   Management needs to be highly screened."
good,"Great place to work. 18-20 staff members, including 3 Account Managers, Regional Sales Manager, 14 Sales Reps. Every morning I come on and brew two pots of coffee, turn on computers, logon in to my Outlook , start my day. communicate directly with Brokers and Clients. Correspond to emails and assist Sale Reps and Account Managers"
good,a typical day at work I would take incoming calls from insurance clients that had filed claims on their homes. I would help them threw the repairs steps and getting their claim checks. I also processed  claim checks
good,"•	Review various types of insurance documents and update hazard insurance information"
good,Good benefits. Decent Pay. Environment is conducive for learning. Coworkers are nice. The work can be mundane sometimes but for the most part it is fast-paced.
good,A typical day at Assurant is inbound/ outbound calls to homeowners and insurance companies. Most importantly customer service is a must. It is a pleasure taking care of homeowners and making sure all there needs and concern are met.
good,The managers were great. Sometimes things didn't happen as quickly as hoped for. It could get stressful as sometimes callers were upset homeowners. Overall a good job with steady hours.
good,"Sriven Infosys is an IT staffing services provider placing highly qualified IT professionals with companies and organizations nationwide. Company offers a broad range of staffing options and solutions, encompassing most IT department requirements. Software programming and application development can be outsourced directly to us or handled by one of our associates overseas (Ashburn VA)."
good,"•	Customer Service: taking member and provider calls"
good,"Constant changes which isn't bad but the morale in the company is at an all time low. "
good,"Good place to work. Learned a lot about health insurance enrollment. Nice location, easy to get to. Good benefits. Management is good."
good,Company review is a well balance company and many things to learn . from Escrow account to taxes and insurance information.
good,i like i i come in and start my work on the computer the people are nice and if i was not moving i would stay here. i am a processing spealist the work is not hard at all
good,"Self-directed daily activities included agent or small business meetings and phone calls to insurance agents. The company teaches effective sales techniques, with annual sales conferences to gather useful information from the top salespeople and the leaders of the company."
good,"Awesome company, not so awesome benefits. The work environment is good. Co-workers are good to work with and friendly."
good,"Job security, can be fast paced and stressful at times. Mediocore benefits. Customer service driven. Learned about mortgage and mortgage insurance requirement. Held manager responsibilities for over a year."
good,"I obtained a lot of very valuable information whilst working at Assurant.  When and if I ever purchase a home, I will be very educated."
good,"Inbound call center, for credit protection program on credit cards"
good,"I work in the call center department and the typical work day is stressful, mundane, and boring. The pay for this job title is great considering the benefits included. It is very hard to advance to a different position, It's about who you know not what you know. Management is not up to par as mine still cannot submit important information I provide on a timely basis. My manager hired her friend for a team lead position and might I add no one on our team was happy especially when we had two great candidates who were already knew the client. I have submitted over 100 applications, have reviewed my resume with other managers for corrections, was only called for 1 interview. There is favoritism but I can say I do enjoy my coworkers. Overall I'd recommend this company as a stepping stone but not a permanent place of employment."
good,"Hazard insurance processing. Data entry, customer service. Easy work, but very in depth."
good,"There are a lot of managers, some are great. We have a lot of co-workers, some are like family. The facility is very nice with a cafe and walking path around the pond."
good,Being able to handle at least 50-60 calls and handle your own job. Good Co-workers.
good,Love coming to work knowing that a group of people put their heads together to get things done. Everyone has a specific task and are able to complete them to the best of their abilities.
good,The management team was great. Great training plan.  Pay could have been better
good,"Great Job"
good,"I enjoyed working with insurance, and mortgages of homeowners. To reassure the homeowners the funds needed to repair their property was available,and assist in the process to get there funds released to them. My team leads were always there to assist. I enjoyed working with various people, there were so many different attitudes to deal with, and everyone always worked as a team. I truly enjoyed it. The hardest part of the job was making sure each scenario was handled in the correct manner, to assure the homeowner was provided with the correct information. The most enjoyable part of the job was making sure the homeowner was reassured and satisfied with the process."
good,"I would certainly recommend, I enjoyed working for this company and I learned so much about homeowners insurance and well as loss draft claims. The hardest part of my job was speaking to a homeowner who had a loss."
good,This was maybe the best employer thus far. It not only was a job but provided some knowledge for personal life as well.
good,mostly data entry. great manager. was sad to know the company laid off
good,I take inbound calls from Home Owners as well as Insurance Companies and agents. I assist with paying premiums to insurance companies as well as monitor clients accounts to ensure adequate coverage is maintained.
good,"Assurant specialty Property "
good,Laid back environment with great people. Assigned various projects and given flexible schedule to complete them.
good,I learned a lot from this company. I worked there for 4 years.
good,During my employment at Assurant Health I had the ability to be cross-trained to work for several departments within the company.
good,"Good place to work if you can secure a permanent position, great benefits, nice co -workers"
good,"The place was a good place to work, but just like every company it has it down falls.  "
good,being training and being able to become more advance about processing homeowners insurance.
good,Listening to conversations between the customer and the agent can be funny. The agent is explaining the next steps that are needed and the customer says things to the agent as if we do not know our job function. We advised the agents on how to diffuse an issue and how to make the customer feel important.
good,What's good about it:
good,I have been blessed to work at such a good company. I have worked at Assurant for almost 12 years now.
good,A typical day at work would include interacting with customers (agents and homeowners) to obtain renewal information for hazard policies or resolving issues. Great work environment. Easy to get along with co-workers and members of management.
good,"The position itself was rewarding. The management staff was more focused on the numbers than they were on making sure that the employee satisfaction rates were successful. There was a very high turn over, and in a call volume call center, it is vital to maintain staffing levels. The pay rate was decent for the geographical location, but in accordance with similar industries in other areas, the staff should have been paid a higher rate."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of multi tasking throughout the day. The department is definitely numbers driven, however accuracy is a must. Excellent company to have worked for!"
good,The company and benefits were excellent but it depended on the department you were in. Could be stressful if you didn't know how to cope with the clients.
good,Accurate and fun training for everyone. Inforced policies and procedures. Great security.
good,At assurant there is a nice working atmosphere. You are very well in the kowledge for the postition you are taking. The only negative thing about the job is if you are hired on through a temp service they keep promising you will be hired on within a year which is not true and many people working through a temp service are still there years later still working through a temp servie. This saves assurant money for paying you less than what you would make if you worked through them.
good,"The company is stable and work is at times stressful with deadlines occurring on an adhoc basis.  The company pushes for accountability to ensure we are meeting the demands of the client.  Micromanagement does occur and you just have to accept that as part of the culture. Overall, just like any company, you have to find the balance that works for you in order to succeed."
good,"Relaxed atmosphere as long as you make production and quality standards you are good. Management varies from laid back to micromanaging, depends on department and manager."
good,It was a stable job that offered opportunities for growth if you were aggressive about asking. Happy day. Good day. Cloudy day. It was nice at time. I would work there again.
good,Management is always willing to work with you no matter your situation. Coworkers are always nice and helpful. The office regularly held holiday events and stuck with team building.
good,It was a decent place to work. You learn alot about the FEMA program. Consistant work. Pay was just lower than majority of underwriting industry and advancement seems slow
good,I learned a lot while being there. It was my first job out of college. The company is located in a safe place with security. It is a a very professional setting for where it is located in south Florida.
good,High stress indicators and for the workforce anaylsts don’t get paid near as much as they deserve for the work they do. Employees are close to each other and they are supportive of people I recovery for addiction
good,"Great people to work with. "
good,Assurant is a great starter Job that could possibly turn in a career for some. An individual will learn the basic skills needed to advance their career.
good,"For someone with no call center experience I did pretty well however quality expectations were not always realistic given the work load (at times 50-60 calls a day). Management almost NEVER available to assist the ""team"" and dis not follow up very well either. It's a gamble if you get a manager who puts in effort."
good,"Great place to work lots of benefits, but if they can replace with someone in another country or a robot they will in a heartbeat. IT is really chaotic with re-orgs going on all the time and turf wars between sites. There are good people doing great things but you have to be on your game. Be prepared to do the impossible at least twice a week."
good,"Productive and enjoying the people on the calls they would often times, make your day. i enjoyed working there, it is a great place, the manages are a great team of people to work with with."
good,"My assignment is in the Fulfillment area.  Duties including filling of orders, processing orders, and shipping orders for a 12 hour shift is sometimes challenging,"
good,"Assurant is going through a major transformation at this time and the current atmosphere is stressful.  Employees are unsure of what their roles will be or if they will even have a job once the transformation has been completed.  This is overall a great company to work for, and the management teams all have great attitudes."
good,"I managed several demanding clients on a day to day basis, and I was typically available to them 24/7.  The most challenging part of the day was explaining various IT issues that seemed to occur on occasion, that ultimately negatively impacted the client processes.  Most enjoyable part of the job was the ongoing relationships that I was able to develop with my clients.  I have become great friends on a personal level with many of the contacts that I have worked with.  Management could be combative at times which led to undue stress."
good,The job is okay but going through a temp agency is not a good thing you don't have any benefits. I don't like going through a temp agency because you never get hired on as a full time it seems like. I;m going on 5 months but still going through a temp
good,"Quase um ano de estágio, onde tudo correu perfeitamente bem, aprendi muito sobre a estrutura de uma segurada, porém a empresa está deixando a Capital de SP, então precisei buscar outras oportunidades."
good,"Overall, a good place to work. Going through downsizing and consolidation - the only drawback along with the location. Typically could be a hectic commute unless you live near the facility."
good,"I've been with this company for 10 years and it has been n up and down rollercoaster. I'm not really sure if it's the company or the people who are in higher positions, but what I can say is that some days are good and some days are not."
good,"I enjoyed my time with The Warranty Group, although my time was cut short due to sickness. Grew a lot in terms of my decision making process, even though my position was entry level."
good,Fast paced lots of changes. Management changes recently have placed a heavy focus on process improvement.  I enjoy the hectic environment and enjoy the day to day challenge. The best part of working at Assurant is going to battle everyday with my team.
good,Very busy with stimulating work that requires you to think.  Great and dedicated people to work with.  Awesome training opportunities with locations throughout the world.
good,"This was a great company to work for until health care reform put the company out of business.  The growth opportunity, compensation and other benefits were great!"
good,This job has taught me how to handle certain situations carefully. This will improve customer service skill and computer knowledge. It has its good and bad days. Management will try to make the place as comfortable and enjoyable as possible.
good,"This company gives you great experience. You can enter as a entry level job and gain enormous experience. The most enjoyable part of the job is  the activity the company sets up for the employees. They do alot of family oriented activities through out the year. In my department you are constantly getting trained on something new, which can be a con and a pro. You dont spend much time on the same task. I feel it has been hard to move around in the company or department for that matter. They want you to have experience, however sometimes you arent given the opportunity to show what you are capable of."
good,"I am very happy to work with Zensar Technologies, and with my experience my manger are extremely good and cooperative and supportive. The company is good and managing very well"
good,The company often moves impulsively with no regards for effect or long term plans. Projects are often decided not by business analysts but by committee with no regards for viability or customer impact.
good,"Project is exciting, a great opportunity to learn and expand my skill set toward furthering my career. Enjoyed the opportunity to work with my teammates using the Agile development methodology on such a transforming project."
good,"I assisted homeowners via telephone with the loss to their property. Essentially i represented the mortgage company and my goal was to ensure that the home was restored to its former or better status while providing accurate information to the homeowner while being empathetic to their situation. The hardest part of my job was just the initial period where I was learning what Quality Assurance wanted to hear on the call, but after a few months, I mastered the calls and repeatedly scored all 100's on my QA.  My overall QA for my 3 years on the phones was 98%.  The most enjoyable part of my day was assisting a homeowner who suffered a loss to the home and was essentially despondent prior to their contact with me and by the end of the call, they are excited about the future"
good,Help customers go through their insurance policies to get them to the next steps in the process. Answering phones and customer service daily. Reviewing people's files to be able to call them and help them move forward.
good,"I don't have anything to add to this.  Nice people, good location.  Grateful for my 16 years plus at this company.  That is all."
good,"Assurant provides a range of work ethic and you can get really hands on, training is ok, benefits are excellent pay can use a new adjustment and its ok for short term. I had great co-workers , some management is hit or miss depends on the pressures of upper management. Nationstar is the biggest pain in the company they provide you with minimal information but wants superior work and also threatens or leave company resulting in lots of job loss, also alot of layoff and outsourcing with last 2 years so beware all in all its Ok !"
good,"Specializing in providing extended service contracts and other risk management solutions."
good,Assurant provides coworkers with the comfortability of providing great services to our customers but making sure the work is done ahead of schedule.
good,"A typical day at Assurant is very hard working, with intense research required.  Co-workers are outstanding always working together to complete all task for the day.  Each day is never the same always learning something different and challenging my mind."
good,"Your day is very fast paced, you won't get bored. You learn something new daily, management is barely around. Co-workers are okay, hardest part of the job is NOTHING, most enjoyable part of the job is they show their employees APPRECIATION."
good,"The typical work day is filled with mystery. Each day is a hard working day, or a fluent consistent day. The workers here are mostly in house representatives;however, majority of the workers are working from home. The most difficult part of my day, is the irate customers that don't understand something and try to make their best judgement seems as though they are correct. The most enjoyable part of each day would be the response to customer that are so sure of themselves, but are incorrect and lash out because they did something wrong. This satisfaction is not to upset them or for enjoyment purposes, but that lets me know that I am doing my job and educating the customer."
good,I've worked for ten years here and only left because advancement is almost non-existent and once you get to a certain point with your raises you barely receive any more at all.
good,"Good pay, Good hours, excellent benefits, lousy environment with a lot of gossip and favoritism, no consideration of employees in business decisions"
good,"Assurant is a great place to work, even though a little shaky at the moment. It is a great place to learn valuable tools that transfer to many different industries."
good,very fun place to work and meeting different people. A company I will never regret working for. Felt like family the entire 4 years and met great people that I will continue to talk to even now that I know longer work there.
good,"You have to work for six days a week and 8 hours a day. Being employed for a couples of months, I have learned a lot, first, enhance the communication skills and you must have a good control in voice for you are often talking to the clients over the phone. second, you must be good or faster as long as you can in typing for this kind of a job requires you to be a multitasking. Talking and typing at the same time. Third, you must be good in listening. Lastly, I have learned how the clients to be calmed especially the irate one."
good,"It is a normal work place,i learned about Assembly,Industrial Painting,Computer application,SAP working,Machining working,Hand tool,costing,inventory,time computition etc.Over all vision of the management is very poor.Co-workers are both type good and bad.There is mixed part of job some time you have to work more then 12 hours a day and some time 9 hours.Office invarment and comfort level is good but shops are not upto the mark."
good,processed hazard insurance checks for homeowners. Answered Customer service calls.
good,"I can handle any type of situation's, People skills, I Learned from different people and cultures. I learn so much each day about mortgages and how to help people. Co-workers are great we always come to each other if problems occur and we need help. We have a birthday club we decorate and if someone is in need we help them. Management we have been through alot of different managers and everyone of them have taught me so much I like to learn from different people. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing I may have helped someone keep there home or pay a premium knowing if not for me this may not have been done. It's a great feeling."
good,">Fast paced working environment"
good,"good work expiriance,Claims specialist, typing and documenting"
good,"This job offers one of the best benefit packages I have ever encountered. The job is stressful, but manageable as long as you can handle the large call volume. The management team was always very attentive and helpful. I enjoyed my coworkers very much, they made the job less stressful. The hardest part of the job was dealing with all the escalated calls that resulted from insurance claims. I would recommend this job to anyone up for a challenge."
good,Assurant is a nice place to work. I processed insurance documents and made inbound calls. The employees were great. I didn't have any benefits that's why I left the job and worked for TCI.
good,"Knowing as you start your day, it would always be a new challenge. I learned a new trade, would love to stay in that field of work. Management was professional, good atmosphere, not being hired as a permanant worker. Being able to work independently."
good,After 6 years i was able to work from home in a high profile position. Management in 50% of the company was a joke and I could have done a better job but its all about politics. If you can play the game then you would be a good fit but if you just rely on your work to speak for itself then good luck on moving up in the company. If it wasnt for some of the good people and friends i met there i probably wouldnt have stayed 7 years.
good,An international company with a professional work culture dedicated to the company success and progression. A supportive environment with a focus on collaboration.
good,"Good place for work from life balance dependent on your management. Ability to work from home is also a benefit, depending on management. Good place to work."
good,"I learned a lot"
good,Exelent place to work and grow as a person as long that you go to work with an open mind. They are hiring more and more. I wish them the best for their future.
good,"I like the job, however I feel like management could be better and they don't keep their words all the time. They would tell people that they would get a pay upgrade and than they don't."
good,"Every day is a new challenge. Hardly ever the same thing two days in a row. Whether you customer service, processing or in a special department. Every day you'll see something new."
good,"Very friendly oriented place to work, everyone is there to help other succeed. Typical Call Center environment with a casual culture.  Best part of my job was being able to work at my own pace, being able to help others with the knowledge I gained from management along with having a great team to work with."
good,This typically depends on who you work for.  Unfortunately my prior manager quit and we were given another one.  This person was awful and she went out of her way to make others miserable.
good,Working remotely is a good entry-level job. The pay is decent for my location. Advancement is almost non-existent and raises are minimal. Schedules are based on business needs and not very flexible.
good,"Overall, Assurant is a great company to work for. They are all about improving the company and asking for employees input. I feel that within the Florence site, being promoted within is based upon ""who you know"" instead of *what you know"". I've worked at Assurat a while and have acquired knowledge from numerous departments and functions.  I've applied for several Manager positions but didn't get them. I was told that I'm too much of a people person and that I like the experience. I feel manager experience is acquired with the job title,  acquiring as you go along."
good,"Depending on the division of the company you work for, the culture varies just a bit, and the location is also a big factor on local perks offered to employees.  The IT organization tends to reorg every 5 years or so, and layoffs can occur when that happens.  Better local benefits at the corporate offices than at the remote business sites.  Hit your production numbers and you will do well in the business divisions."
good,The job was good because i had a lot of friends who would teach me how to do the job good and ith that i learned how to be good at it. i worked about 40+ hours a week and they gave me a fair salary.
good,Enjoyed my time at Assurant.  Worked three different positions during my employment.  All positions were entirely work from home.  This helped with life/work balance and family commitments.
good,"Great for new starters and low-mid level agents. Lots of exciting things put on by the company however, when getting to management level, focus is lacking."
good,"They over work their employees, to the point where employees just quit because of all of the hours forced to work,  non stop mandatory overtime for months on end. Half of the year however there is no work at all to the point where they make people go hoe early (using PTO time to do so)"
good,I enjoyed the challenging work. I learned something new everyday. It was very stressful at times. Some managers were better than others. The benefits were good. Assurant Health went out of business.  The health insurance business is very unstable right now.
good,It is your standard 9-5 corporate job. It comes with benefits and hours of a white-collar job. The pay for my position was great but they will add more responsibilities for which your pay may not be adequate any more. This is a good place to work
good,Working at The Warranty Group was a great experience. I was part of a team and encouraged to learn new skill sets which prepared me for career advancement.
good,Loss Draft Department has very poor management. depending on the client some managers are better than other but the manager I had barely knew anything without needing help from the team leads
good,Working in management requires you to attend numerous meetings daily while still managing your team. It is essential to have controls in place that monitor productivity and quality.
good,Its tough helping your children with school work when getting off at 8:30 PM. Then not knowing what your schedule will be in three months can be disruptive to some people's family life. I need structure. It just didn't fit me.
good,Assurant is a great place to work. Pay is a bit low and there weren't any advancement opportunities for my role. Great people and flexible work schedule that allow you to earn PTO during implementation cycles.
good,Overall working experience was positive. I was given the opportunity to grow and develop. Challenges were part of the work life and tat is what i enjoyed the most
good,"A good place to work, great management and benefits, but low pay rate and bonuses. Limited OT available with 14 days PTO per year. Good work environment."
good,"Relaxed, non strresful job with competitive edge.  Provided many lunches when we were busy.  Had fun workplace parties. Manager was great at coming and talking to us everyday."
good,"I was laid off from Assurant on September 08.  There have been many changes to the entire company, so I can't speak on what is occurring at this time."
good,Worked as a processor at Assurant via Manpower. There are multiple departments there but not much room for advancement. They bring in a lot of temp employees and that's based on business coming in. Work can be tedious and stressful at times but I loved the people I worked with and it was a very nice facility.
good,The workplace is very goal-driven and associate oriented. They always try to involve the associates in someway and show appreciation. They provide free healthcare screenings and different activities to partake in.
good,The environment is great except the hours that are given to you change by the time you actually start the job and the support that is given is very lacking.
good,"Nice place to work but the issue was the company was moving location out of country and a hundred and fifty or so employees lost our jobs. I wish they stayed in Cork.,"
good,nice managers and staff. working hours not the best and parking isn't great. there are options to move around different departments and lots of training is provide
good,AFAS has great workplace culture. Company offers employees to work remote. Company has great team building activities to engage with employees and hear their thoughts and opinions on how to improve workflow.
good,"Great place to work with the right management team; my position allows great flexibility and I'm not required to hold down a desk; however, I'm not a fan of micro-managing"
good,Very good company to work with. My experience with this company taught me to always be prepared. Create a work pattern to make your day go a little easier.
good,"I worked remotely, which made it tough to be a part of the company culture.  However, the teams are very collaborative and work hard for their clients."
good,I was in a very good department that was self directed with experienced staff. Peers were very competent worked well together.
good,Great company to work for. Getting to assist homeowners in a time of loss is full filling. Working on a team where we all help one another would be a plus.
good,"The hardest part of the job has been completing inspections and reports to meet my high standards, but still meet company quota demands. It can be difficult to walk away from the office when the office is in your home. However, being based out of my home has also allowed for flexibility in scheduling personal commitments around my work schedule."
good,The organization is financially stable and currently in transition.  Great opportunities may present themselves for individuals who work in the Miami or Atlanta locations.  Work load may challenge balancing a healthy work/lifestyle balance.
good,"A typical day at work consists of logging in to my phone and taking as many calls as possible. in between calls I have to process insurance information, update policy information, make premium payments, and send out letters if needed. I also keep track of any refresher learning courses I have to take."
good,"Answer calls from clients either making an insurance claim or checking on the status of said claim,"
good,A typical day at work was productive and it was a cohesive environment. Management was supportive in advancement and always willing to help.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is the employee engagement. When you're working with a great team, you tend to have great days at the office!"
good,"Decent amount of office politics, and with good expectations of moving up within the company is fully supported. Meeting numbers are part of every day requirements and evaluations."
good,I'm afraid this company needs a much very management team. Since the company keeps falling apart day by day. It's a shame really I spent 2 years there and at the part was one of the best jobs I've encountered
good,"I am the Manager of the 2 largest clients in our property loss department. I am responsible for 23 direct reports across 2 different businesses. "
good,It was a great company to work for. I learned a great deal about technology advances within the organization that could be used in different business siltation. The Management team well organized and my co-workers were worthy of their positions. The hardest part of my day was ensuring Customer service Dept. was performance proficient and effective. Great benefits and compensations were great.
good,"Assurant overall was a good work place.  I love the fact of being able to work at your own pace as long as you do what was required.  I like to go over and beyond on my job. Management was ok but really didn't look at the big picture.  I learned a great deal about team work.  Even though your job was based on individuality, it still took a team to get the work out.  So if it took me showing someone what I knew to get the job done then that is what I did.  It pays not to be selfish.  The hardest part of my job was working for a manager that didn't know the job and just assumed that things went a certain way.  I learned to look past it and to continue to do what was asked out of me.  I love the atmosphere but I do believe that there is better for me."
good,"I started in the customer service for a year and moved to the claims department. I processed claims for purchases that were insured by American Express and make sure that the charge was in the account and the amounts, request for documentation, police report if this was a stolen items, once I have all the required documentation,  I made the credit in the account for the amount approved. My authority payment was for a limit of $1000 per claim, for the Platinum card I was authorized to pay $10,000 after manager review. Once in a while processed Baggage claims, when that area was pretty busy. "
good,"This company provides stability for employees, the turnover rate is not so high as typical insurance companies."
good,"The greatest thing about the company is that it promotes from within. The absolutely worst thing about the company is that the organization is forever changing. Sometimes the changes happen so often that it's extremely difficult to get anything done because your job duties, managers, departments are steadily changing."
good,"Assurant is a good company overall... I would say it really depends on who your Manager is, and also the quality of your work when it comes to compensation and job advancement.  I've learned how to be really flexible and how to adjust to change working at Assurant.  I would love to advance within the company, but that does not seem to be much of an option at this time.  The most enjoyable part of the job for me is assisting Customers and resolving the issues they call in about.  The hardest part of the job is effectively assisting the Customer when the issue calls for follow up or research to be done after the call has ended, when there is a lack of time available due to service level.  I have always had good personal experiences with my Co-Workers and Management.  From a business side, I have not always felt as though Management was up to par and I've felt slighted at times as it relates to compensation based on my performance."
good,My typical day at work was placing calls to customers or policy updates on Commercial and Residential Property Insurance. Some Insurance Reps were rude and some were nice. The hardest part of the job was not being able to help a customer if their name was not listed on the loan. The most enjoyable was when a Home owner called and was able to pay their Home Owners Insurance.
good,"A typical day starts with me running a few reports for supervisors and then on to my projects and meetings.  Most of my projects are numbers oriented and in Microsoft Excel.  I have taught myself how to create graphs using a variety of data and formats.  The hardest part of the job is stress.  Personally, my work is reviewed by execs and VPs so it has to be on spot each time. My co-workers are supportive and helpful.  The concept of a team is not something that is stressed at work so that is a little bit of a knock but, I tend to work better alone or with a couple of people.  The most enjoyable part is the little things the company does for the employees.  We do get perks and treats that I really have never seen anywhere and that is refreshing to know that someone still thinks of the employees."
good,"Mostly good days. Always learning new functions(myself anyway). Certain management are great to work with others hoover and complicate the day. Best to learn functions quickly and proficiently  and find others who know the material instead of counting on team leads and managers. Co-workers are great everyone gets along for the most part always good laughs and everyone is friendly from my experience. Job is fairly easy, but most complicated when you are moved from one project to the next and expected to complete both in a timely manner when you don't have much time to begin with. Love the people i work with most enjoyable part of my job."
good,The environment is very positive and the people are super friendly
good,Great place to work with great people and incentives. Unfortunately unable to maintain employment due to lay off.
good,"         Taking inbound and making outbound sales calls in a call center environment presenting individual and family major medical, limited benefit fixed indemnity, short term, and supplemental insurance products.  Consult with customers and assess insurance needs based on their current situation and recommend the appropriate health plan.  Uses an assumptive selling style to close each sales opportunity.  Assist with training new agents during side by side sessions.  "
good,"Lots of room for advancement. It felt like i was walking on egg shells at times. Managers were not a friendly as could be. The building had top flight security, who were inchagre of firing. Security guards ran the building.."
good,Like most jobs a lot depends on your direct supervisor and their immediate supervisor. Overall not a bad place to work!
good,"Taking inbound calls & making outbound calls, data entry in a paperless workplace."
good,I would begin my day by conecting with my team and saying good morning each day to make sure everyone was well and ready for business.
good,a typical work day is taking escalated property calls from homeowners. Co- workers complain and are unhappy. Hardest part of my job is the client I have does not care about the homeowners.
good,Typically this job follows many other production schemed businesses. Work is plenty and fairly easy. Often feels like busy work.
good,Low to average salary with high volume monitored sales activity. Bonus for sales.
good,"Great company to begin your career with. Pay, PTO and insurance are all big benefits. They are big into working remote. In Duluth 80% of the staff is WFH."
good,"Assurant is a good place to work, providing fair salaries and bonuses. In addition, work and life balance is important. The downside is that management does not provide training for promotion and most senior management is out for money and stock. Overall, I would go back and I would recommend the company to new comers."
good,"Good location to Tampa or Clearwater/ St. Petersburgo commute.  But Ilearned about extended vehicle protection contrcts and claims.   They fed us a lot, good food. Some mad customers, everyday self learning."
good,"Decent company.  Poor management training. Very disconnected upper management, however they are knowledgable.  Great sustainability. Flexible and understanding with employees."
good,Assurnt offers very good benefits along with good pay and overtime. It is a more relaxed environment with very hands on managers. They constantly keep up with their employees to make sure they're adjusting properly.
good,Aprendes mucho y hay mucho apoyo por parte de tus compañeros cuando tenias alguna duda.
good,"I gained exposure commercial claim handling and preparing claims for arbitration.  There are opportunities for growth, and incentives and bonuses    ."
good,"Assurant Health was a good company to work for. They believed in their employees, supported them through education reimbursement, bonuses, good benefits and paid time off. Profit sharing was matched 3 to 1, and offered a retirement plan as well."
good,"So long as you follow your documents for your assigned area, you will have no problems with the work. Management can be somewhat iffy, depending on your area, and your shift."
good,over all good place to maintain good employment with benefits. the pay was not well for the amount of work you had to do. managment was your peer frother year before
good,"This is a great company to work for . They make you feel at home  and the have bonuses and advancement. Also they do certain things, such as dressing out for different holidays, sports teams, etc. It's a fun an exciting place to work."
good,Overall okay job. I have been here 2 years advanced to a supervisor extremely fast. PTO and request off go to HR for answers NOT YOUR MANAGER! Keep a paper trail of all time off clock in and outs.
good,"Assurant is a good company to work for, overall. They allow opportunities for continued education through: training, workshops, one on one time for improvement in any or all areas of interest. They value improving you as an employee and promote within."
good,Assurant is a very professional organization with progressively challenging work and growth opportunities. The company is also very diversified with a global presence.
good,"Good plant manager, several great supervisors, but lacking in directors who can take criticism of their procedures and staff.  HR department to focus on protecting their own jobs then protecting company or employees.  "
good,"Assurant is an excellent company overall. Good working relationships between the business unit and corporate support."
good,"i am not happy from what i get paid.i am operating forklift i am certified forklift operator but compare to other employers thier pay is way more less,thats why i am looking for another job"
good,My experience was great until I had medical problems. Then management was not understanding at all. Even when I had paperwork from the hospital and all of my doctor's it wasn't good enough and the management didn't care policy is policy and they aren't going to back even their good people up.
good,I learned about the different types of insurance laws. A typical day would be  me processing lender place billing and making sure my accounts are in order. The most enjoyable part of the job was the relationship I had with my coworkers. The hardest part of the job was learning new clients procedures.
good,I worked for Assurant for over 5 years and the only thing that is challenging is being under paid and being under bad management if you are unfortunate.
good,Assurant Solutions Lewisville is going through some changes and those changes are requiring them to eliminate some job positions. It's a good company to work for though and would highly recommend it to anyone.
good,depending on what part you work at it can be very stressful great managers great co workers  can be relaxed in some ways learned how to take insurance claims.
good,"Lots of good people to work with and learn from."
good,"The day began reviewing the project status or campaign performance.  Then scheduled meetings to complete tasks and timelines.  Publishing status reports and collecting information from others.  I managed multiple call center projects or campaigns."
good,"Review various types of insurance documents and update the hazard insurance lines on the clients servicing system according to established procedures. Verify that the policy contains acceptable coverage and disburse premium payments from the escrow account if required; make necessary outbound phone calls to insurance agents, and companies to update insurance policies and obtain missing information. Perform maintenance as necessary for policy changes, letters, notices etc."
good,Worked from 7:00 to 4 pm. I learned a lot about cell and smart phones. I enjoyed working with the people at Assurant. Management was not so nice to the people doing the work of repairing the cellphones.
good,"Busy, fast paced environment.  Management in general is typical, most are good managers, but there were some bad eggs.  The company has a very good benefits package and there is room to grow your career.  They celebrate customer service week and employees are treated to a daily gift and a celebration at the end. They make you feel appreciated."
good,"Work at Assurant at time could be very stress as pending your management team, they might lose focus on the people and think solely of numbers. Great place for advancement, promotes from within."
good,I spent over 18 years at Assurant.  The only reason I left was to pursue and advanced opportunity with one of our own clients.  They were my client for over 14 years and they asked me to join their team.
good,"Assurant Health was a fantastic employer, but is now going out of business, displacing 1500+ workers.  I would have stayed there until I retired if I could have."
good,"Working at Assurant is a fairly easy job; you have to want to work and progress in order to do so. It is really easy money, but turnover rate is high due to people not being able to handle the environment. If you go to work and do your job, you have secure employment."
good,my typical day at work consist of  a goal I set for my self to always complete my work before a certain time of the day. I've learned something almost everyday with the different functions I worked on . my management team was very helpful my workplace was very different got a chance to work around different people. the hardest part of my job was when I had to be out of work for emergency an not  able to be at work to help my team. the most enjoyable was showing up for work getting to work with my team because we was one small family within.
good,"The pay is commensurate with other employers in Indianapolis with full benefits including Aetna health insurance, 401(k) match up to 7%, bonuses, tuition reimbursement, life insurance, short-term and long-term disability, employer discounts, etc. "
good,New territory and the competitor JM&A had the lion share of the market and did a very good job keeping customer base happy with products and services. Very tough sell and not enough incentive to changes providers since they were happy with there current provider
good,"Overall not great company to work for. I have seen many a career stall and sputter in the halls here. Mine almost did, had I not had the good sense to pull the ripcord when I did. Convenient location almost made me stay."
good,"Asssurant is a leader in many industries.  There are a lot of opportunities to learn and grow as the company is involved in multiple industries.  The corporate culture is business casual, friendly and inviting."
good,"I enjoyed my employment with TWG, the people were all very nice and understanding. Had family day where the company would plan a gathering for all employees and families.  I learned a lot and was able to further my skill. The only thing I don't agree with is how the company restructured and took our jobs to another country without regard to us employees who had dedicated years of loyalty and hard work.  Guess thats corporate America though-all in a days work. Over all I enjoyed the job and the people and would go back if had the opportunity."
good,"though sometimes interesting, work was usually quite and smooth with supervisors' around anytime when needed. good communication dialogue between associates and employees all year round, good environmental and security practices ever noted."
good,"This company gave it's employees so many additional perks from a total rewards basis. The list of add-ons made the job worth it for example there was a: gym, cafeteria, onsite school and daycare, dry cleaner, volunteering opportunities and sports activities to name a few."
good,"the pay is very very good. but you work foriif t.  you don't mind managers breathing down your neck, if you have no family or have anye mergiences this isth e job for you"
good,"When I first started at this company I enjoyed it much more than when I left. I enjoyed having a stack of paperwork that needed done by the end of the day. When it was decided that another department would be merged with the one I worked in, there were too many people away from their desks not working than actually getting the work done."
good,A typical day was we would wait till the phone would ring and then would get them thru the process of filing a claim over the phone and to see if they qualify for a replacement device.   I learned on how the t-mobile exchange process works and u dont always get approved.  My co-workers were great people but they wanted to figure things out for your self.Hardest part of the bad was listing to the sad stories and not being able to help
good,"One Of The Best Warehouse Jobs In Central P.A, The Payroll System Is A Bit Of A Joke I Guess The Compensate Their Employees With Good Benefits And Being Appreciative Of Them , Supervisors Are Pretty Good Managers Are Great, I Loved The Job But It Could Have Been Better ."
good,Team Meeting/Monitoring/Coaching/training/Mentoring/One on One Team Building/Client meetings. How to develop/build a team/Becoming a leader. Management- worked well together/Build a relationship with co-workers. Great team. Releasing/firing a co-worker. I love the interaction of the office/mentoring/coaching/training and watching someone under my leadership develop
good,"I can't say much for the corporate headquarters except that they're very... corporate. The Midtown office is a great, relaxed environment, but work/life balance is lacking. Health benefits are also very lacking."
good,"Being employed with Assurant, it's always been a great pleasure. I learned many of things about insurance companies. Sad to say the company will be closing soon."
good,"I reported into my line manager in Slough, but was based in York, working very closely with the Marketing Manager and the Operations Director and Finance Director. We would work on projects together, work out what we wanted to do, agree strategies, bounce ideas off each other and had the ethos that there was no such thing as a bad idea. "
good,"management was very productive in keeping the store tidy and the workers busy. The days went quick and the people were nice, being my only retail job ever worked I enjoyed my experience."
good,It is a nice company to work for. The cafe staff is super nice & funny. I am very glad I had the opportunity this company work with company.
good,"A typical day at Assurant is logging on system. Working on Home owners loans and making payments on renewal for insurance. We have to work in over 5 different queues and day, processing over 240 loans a day. Most of the managers there are understanding of there associates needs to help them to strive for 100% a day and then there are some that is not understanding and very negative. No motivation to push there team to greatness at all. Overall Assurant is a good company to work for."
good,"Enjoyed the work experience with co-workers. Management was approachable and flexible. Received calls from customers regarding  homeowners insurance. answered their inquiries, Responded to customer and third party faxes and emails. The work environment was very pleasant."
good,"Good compensation, good benefits, good work environment. Was able to use my many years of customer service to help many customers with their Insurance and claim issues."
good,"A typical day at Assurant UK was interesting and competitive. The frequency of calls was undetermined and the frequency of sales/retentions was never predictable but this ensured that there was always a chalange evident during the day. It was very sales driven and employees were equally motivated postively by management. "
good,"As a Call Center Supervisor, I manage work at home associates as well as in-house associates.  We operate a 500+ seat call center.  My group is inbound calls for Suntrust Mortgage Insurance.  I love coaching, training and developing associates."
good,"I enjoyed my co workers,  It is definately a high energy, multiple task position."
good,"Assurant is a reputable company and is the crutch for various Fortune 500 companies, which will continue to secure them,  financially, for years to come. I was privileged to have been employed there for nearly five years. My team was a family and I was comfortable as a team member and respected my supervisor.  I would most definately recommend this company to anyone looking for a stable and friendly place of employment."
good,At first glance Assurant was a great place to work and a good place to advance. It had a corporate look with a middle school attitude. The upper management used zero communication and made decisions before having all the facts.
good,Feel pretty good about coming to work.  The company is great on how they take care of everyone.
good,"Each day I come in at 15 minutes early to check emails from underwriting to see if there is anything needed on files pending and if I have got any emails from new customers. After I take care of that I will make sure that I am logged in at my start time to take inbound calls from prospecting clients looking for health insurance. The part of the job that can be challenging is the repetitive nature of these calls and you have to work all calls even though there is no deal to be had. It does get frustrating. "
good,Very relaxed environment and laid back management. Good place to work with good people. Usually busy customer service center but enjoyable.
good,Assurant is a great company to work for. The management team is awesome.
good,Assistant is good place to work with friendly people and management team.
good,"If they could keep consistent with all the management it would be a lot better, the management is very good and always there to offer help, however you will consistently get different answers to the same question."
good,"Great management, they company always had fun events to keep the moral up."
good,"Overall, this was a very enjoyable work environment. My co-workers were friendly and helpful; the management was generally cooperative. The typical day was always interesting with different customers having different issues which we, as a team, were almost always able to resolve."
good,If you can deal with the management it can be a great job. Overall it is an okay place to work.
good,"I worked at Assurant for 9 years. I was promoted from Production Bench Technician to QA Engineering Tech after 4 years. The hours were steady and the work environment was very pleasant. All of my co-workers were generally nice people and everyone always got along for the most part. On a typical day I would review device components from new suppliers, write documents for new device inspection, train QA inspectors on inspection of new devices or components, educate myself on upcoming devices that the company would be working with, and communicate with our component suppliers to resolve any quality issues with the products we were purchasing from them."
good,"Not a bad place to work. people are very nice, management is good. Gets boring and doesnt pay very well."
good,In the earlier years the company provided a excellent environment to succeed. Successfully managed a major financial system implementation project which had the full support of upper management. The project met and exceeded all of its goals.
good,I learn a lot working at Assurant. The management team is very encouraging and always willing to help out when needed.  I take pride in being able to assist homeowners and restoring their lives by getting them back into their homes.
good,"With the exception of management, it was an excellent place to work and mentor. I also had the chance to become a weekly Read-to-a-Child volunteer which was unexpectedly rewarding."
good,"We play ping pong most afternoons. I'll rather not speak about it. But it is a good place to work, No complaints at this time. We will see what the future holds."
good,It was easy but face paced. You need to be willing to learn as well as accept responsibility for mistakes. The other associates aren't especially friendly so be prepared
good,"The jobs is okay don't pay enough,too much drama .not professional. the jobs need to hire more professional people, and hire more men , its to many woman."
good,"Great company to work for, good benefits.  Every one is very nice and helpful.  The company has a nice size campus like feeling, great amenities.  I highly recommend working there."
good,"I would recommend to anyone looking for employment. This company provides lots of room for growth. You will have the opportunity to move around if an great employee to other areas. However, the job security isn't there."
good,decent place to work I just don't particularly care for the shift hours available--but I've been there going on 5 years--would love to see a traditional 1st/2nd/3rd shift available
good,"Very stressful but Assurant as a company is great to work for they really make you feel like they care, As long as you have a good manager you should be fine and I recommend starting out in processing!"
good,I really enjoyed this job. There is a lot of room for advancement. Managers are great. I did not want to leave my position but I relocated and it was a long drive. Employees are great to work with. Pay and benefits are wonderful.
good,"The ones that work the hardest get overlooked.  The ones who goof off with the managers get promoted. "
good,"Assurant Health is no longer an operating business entity, but while it was, it was a pleasure to work there for the years I had. It was a very large organization, and required collaboration with many different departments, at least for my role. People were largely friendly and always professional. As a workplace, I felt as though my peers and I always had each others' backs, building trust and making me feel part of a cohesive team. There was not a tremendous amount of room for advancement, unfortunately, as the department was full of people settled into their roles, and of course, the company was unable to last as a result of the Affordable Care Act, but management was always fair, and open to suggestions from employees, as well as eager to reward hard work. If it were still in operation, I would recommend it as a place to make a lasting career, as so many workers there before me had."
good,"Working here has really open a broadband of opportunities for me. I was exposed to call center life. Although it was fun and you met great people, it was quite challenging. The over whelming feeling that the calls will never stop rolling or that management although was helpful in helping you achieve your goals, they don't help when you are over flowed of callers. I enjoyed my job and wished we hadn't parted ways, but I would recommend this job to anyone willing to take on a fast paced career."
good,Great place to work and grow in your field.  Good work-life balance and your team members are always there to help you with anything you are working on.
good,Great fortune 500 company and great benefits. Managers are good they are willing to work with their employees. Good environment to grow and become a better employee with the company. Just have to be mindful who you associate with. I stay to myself because people will talk down on you here.
good,"I have enjoyed my time.  It is a big company so it is easy to get lost and the management team for my team are all over the country, so getting noticed can be very difficult."
good,"Assurant is a large company, the opportunity for career advancement is great, employees are a little underpaid but there is a good work balance within the company."
good,Assurant had a weekend shift which was pretty great simce i was school it truly helped me earn money and stay focsued im school also was fun to work with phones
good,"A typical day at work in the research department starts about 7:30- 8:00. Logging into multiple systems and gathering information from database, placing phone calls to obtain customers insurance information, correcting customer loans with lender place polices. Creating correspondences for customer inquires. Returning customer calls in regards to complaints. The most stressful part of the job is completing task with unfair time constraints."
good,"I enjoyed 13 years of nurturing and promotion.  This is just a smart company.  I love thier strategic and innovative approaches to business and incomming trends.  Nice office and fair rules.  Great environment.  There were stressful times, most work is project based in Marketing and there is down time also.  No issue with work/life balance."

good,"good company, cafeteria, hire within, ping pong, yammer, company outings friendly "
good,Answering between 70-100 calls per day. Assisting callers with making changes updates and answering any question the caller might have regarding ther policy.
good,You are not trained by trainers you have to rely on your co-workers to show you the job. Your concerns are not really addressed the way they should be in order to benefit the company. I like to work there for the co-workers. We all need a job with good benefits but we also need to move up in a company that we believe in. I believe they are good and will succeed as a phone company. They need to listen to the workers and promote the ones that deserve the recognition.
good,"The workload can be overwhelming if you are a main contact person in your department. I like the management in my Department because they don't look over your shoulder every minutes as long as you get your work done, meet your goal, the manager leaves you alone and you only give them the status of your assignments weekly or one on one meeting."
good,"The other divisions of Assurant Inc. are still in business.  I am not familiar with those products and therefore can not rate them.  However, the company provided generous benefits."
good,"Assurant maintained a very productive environment, with lots of room for growth. With the ebb and flow of clients, they provided a never ending learning experience for employees. They offer great insurance and work bonus incentives"
good,"Management was very understanding and allowed employees opportunities to learn whenever possible.  Employees were very friendly and helpful.  The buyout from Protective Life to Assurant was hard, many layoffs occured as a result."
good,"Wonderful place to work. For the most part, flexible schedules. Assurant Health in particular had a wonderful atmosphere, very friendly. Very serious about servicing the customer but knew how to add some fun and try to keep their employees on a healthy work/home balance."
good,In assurant solution company my shift is 3 days in a week friday saturday and sunday.I usually doing receving work in the compnay. i learned how to done my duty perfect and how to deal with my co wokers and i become lead of my department within first six month.The hardest part of my job is lack of co workers.But my suoervisor and manger support me a lot so i enjoy my work even though it is not part of my education field which i studied.
good,"The place is great for colleges and working environment, however, the management can be a little petty and childish at times which can make working life difficult."
good,"Assurant Health provided a great opportunity to learn and grow within it's walls, but rarely required full time attention outside the standard work week. Days at work typically included handling all tasks assigned with deadlines, correspondence through emails and meetings to address new tasks. Enjoying time away/taking a break during lunch with coworkers and friends was always encouraged by leadership."
good,Assurant closed.  It was a great company to work for.  It provided great benefits to it's employees.  The Employee Appreciation events were always a great time to mingle with your colleges. It was great they did family events as well.  Assurant empowered it's employees.  Assurant gave back to the community.
good,I have gained a lot of experience working in a insurance company that was the most enjoyable part of my job.  I enjoyed working with team that was a valuable asset to the company.
good,"Amazing people, made some amazing friends for life but no chance for progression. "
good,"Enjoyable workplace which provided a through knowledge of the individual health insurance industry. The company was huge on cross training, and the more you learned the more valuable you became to the company. This allowed the company to move you to other departments based on the business needs, which overall helped with your job security."
good,I applied for my position with no experience in Pharmacy and they gave me the chance to learn the job. I succeeded ! I love to learn new things and broaden my skills.
good,"As a former CSR, I learned a lot and enjoyed my job thoroughly. The company was transitioning to Assurant from being an independent property preservation company, but we still had time to make employee time. We went to Main Event in April 2014 and had the chance to meet all of the managers in the company. The problem was receiving promotions. They don't often promote younger folks, even if their skills are more applicable than most people's. They convince you you're being paid well when you actually may be making less than anyone else, and they enforce mandatory OT. A big promotion occurred in my time there, and my manager-turned-supervisor, let the power go to their head. People were quitting left and right because of mistreatment. All in all, the company is great itself and you learn so much from working here."
good,"A typical day at work includes cycle counts, inventory adjustments, and investigation of discrepancies. I have learned the way the business flows and the processes of other areas to understand how inventory moves throughout the building. Management is available for any employee and has the best interest of their workers. The co-workers work together to achieve one goal and create revenue. The hardest part of the job is finding the root cause of a discrepancy looking at all probable causes. The most enjoyable part of the job is the challenge and the ability to grow."
good,Great place to work. The teams fully understands all Clients objective. The managers creating a work environment conducive to personal growth and employee satisfaction.
good,A great company to work for even though  they do lay offs instead of sending you to another department where help is needed. I love the environment and my managers.
good,"A typical work day is full of surprises. New reports, different duties, and deadlines are the same - same day. Datasets are due with accurate data and presentations are performed on a monthly basis to enhance your interpersonal skills."
good,My typical work day consist of processing documents with speed and accuracy. I've learned many things about homeowner insurance. Management and my co-workers assist each other when problems arise. The hardest part about the job is when its sometimes hard to get in contact with agents and insurance companies to obtain the missing information. I enjoy researching and solving problems that may occur.
good,"I assisted homeowners in handling insurance claims and the rebuild of their property. This involved contacting insurance companies, construction companies, and various public adjusters to help the rebuild. I was also in charge of disbursing insurance funds to the appropriate company. I learned so much about how the loss drafts process works, and learned how to manage an upset homeowner while assisting the repairs. I loved working with my team and helping fix the lives that were damaged. The hardest part of my job was hearing the many stories of tragic losses. The most enjoyable part of my job being able to help put their lives back together. I was able to help rebuild their homes, and help everything going back to normal. Hearing a homeowner is able to return home, and having them thank you for your help is worth every minute."
good,Typically on any given day I take 40-50 customer calls a day. I have learned more about mortgages and insurance than I have ever known. The most enjoyable part of my job is the satisfaction of helping people. The hardest part of my job is taking calls when the consumer is very escalated. I like the people I work with and also the management in the company
good,i worked there a long time ago... I cannot give you anything updated as call center workers know the people come and go like a revolving door.. I have not worked there in a long time
good,"Massive 3rd party insurance company "
good,This was working with customer service for people who have been taken advantage of when Circuit City went through there liquidation and closure
good,"This was a great place to work. It was a dependable career. The pay is the best in the call center industry. Recently there have been so many unnecessary changes it just ruins the morale of the entire company. It was a ""family"" feel before, but not it's a ""better watch your back"" feel. It's like walking on eggshells now. You only advance if somebody is fond of you. As far as pay and benefits, it is fine. As for the upper management....just run far away! This place WAS great, but now the mood is just horrible. It's a job. Work day includes coming in, talking to customers about their insurance on their homes, quality will scrutinize everything you do then when you change it, they have a new way of doing things and you get a bad call grade. You constantly watch others walk around doing nothing while you work. Oh yeah....and the normal drama that comes with a call center is here occasionally. The job itself is pretty easy, its just a WHOLE LOT to learn!"
good,Assurant is a great place to work. Opportunities to advance in the work field and competitive salary rates.
good,"Had a okay experience working in a environment were not everybody worked together a lot of supervision , were the mismanagement was inexplicable. Don't have  a lot of good comments to make about this job."
good,I really enjoyed the data entry aspect of my job and my co-workers.  Management was pretty fair working with you when you had problems.  Pay raises were fair.  And I was able to make a program change that able to save time and money.
good,"I enjoy working for the warranty group because the office environment is lively.  My co-workers are a lot of fun to work with, we all help each other out.  When I come into work in the morning I basically take phone calls from customers when needed to help with their warranty claims.  I also do a lot of electronic claims on the computer.  The hardest part of my job is sitting at a desk all day looking at a computer.  As for what I actually do at work it is fun because I get to think about the automotive aspect in a different way."
good,The typical day involved taking inbound phone calls.
good,"Interesting place to work with very interesting people. Over the past almost five years, I was able to obtain unforgetable knowledge that will help me in the distant futue. I was able to enhance my knowledge in marketing and acting as a facilitator."
good,"- Trouble shoot, repair"
good,"A lot of employees, come in on a temporary employment contract for Assurant. Over the span of a year, they give you time to get used to the company and evaluate you as an employee. Though your work can become monotonous, if you do a good job and concentrate, Assurant will try it's best to keep you on as an employee. Attendance is very important here, as is keeping up a good pace when it comes to your paper work. If you are not hired on as a permanent employee after your first year, this may not necessarily mean that you were a bad employee, it may just mean they didn't have the room."
good,"As a Client and Systems Consultant, my day typically consists of training call center represenatitives and/or creating training curriculum, meeting with internal and external clients to determine needs current and future."

I would have continued my career with Assurant but unfortunately the health insurance segment was closed in Wisconsin.

good,Working at Assurant was an impeccable experience. Managers work with you to succeed and exceed expectations. Working for this company has many opportunities for growth!

good,Good place to work. Environment is quick paced. Management does their job efficiently. Job security is high. Overtime available often and sometimes mandatory.
good,"My work day was fast paced at times on the verge of stressful, however my managers were all in the trenches kind of women who lead by example.  I think it is a wonderful company, but wanted a change of environment."
good,Assurant does offer fair wages that include an annual  bonus. The benefit package was less than desirable. They allowed freedom to work independently.
good,"It was a nice place to start out but it constantly changes it's policies but it lacks in communication, not letting workers know what is what until last second."

good,Working with Assurant was a great call center environment. making inbound and outbound call to assist customers with property loss claims. Assurant provided great health benefits and Bonuses was awesome.
good,"Assurant provided me with skills I can use for a lifetime. The training was thorough and very informative. Some managers were number driven, which wasn't to deficult. If you receive the proper training it's all a walk in the park."
good,"As a customer service representative you had to meet weekly expectations on outgoing and incoming calls, and emails. You were to dress business casual and be a quick learner. There was no actual one on one training it was mostly learn as you go and learn by watching others. Once on the phone it is required to problem solve on your own meanwhile multitasking on sending emails and researching data. The best part of this job is the relationships you can make and the perks which involve PTO, company gatherings, coffee almost once a week and flexibility once you are hired on. Downside is the gossip, and no real training. There is also a lot of noise going on around you."
good,"I do multiple jobs at Assurant. I started working with outsource devices that get repaired and sent back to customers. From there, I learned out to transfer devices and send them to other departments. I work at end of the line and a sorting station that allow me to provide support for devices that are getting off the repair belt. I work in sorting them by model and bulk transferring them to send them to another location. The hardest part of the job is balancing the workload and filling in for absent associates."

good,"Assurant is a company that processes property insurance as well as  property claims for a variety of mortgage institutions.  Loss Drafts, or the claims department, is fast paced,customer service oriented department.  The best part of working in Loss Drafts department is being able to help homeowners through a very difficult time, i.e. getting their home repaired/rebuilt after a loss.

good,Very nice environment. structured and fixed schedule. Time is very scare; you are expected to clock in 5 minutes early and leave 5 minutes late sometime. it is friendly work environment.
good,I enjoy the job and also work environment. My Supervisor is very helpful and is always there to assist in any situation. They also have Leads that are there to help if you find yourself in a situation that you can not resolve. The company it self offers great pay and benefits.

good,"Great place to work"
good,Assurant is a very fast growing logistics/manufacturing company that will challenge you and always give you the opportunity to advance your career if interested.
good,"I really did enjoy my time at Assurant in Albany, OR. They make sure to train you pretty well and you have a lot of time off. It is hard to move up in the company though and it can be a popularity contest. However, the job it self isn't too bad. You will get angry customers, but that happens in most call centers and they do try to give you the support you need. However, getting call after call back to back will burn you out. While this isn't a too demanding job, it is very repetitive. While you do get a set schedule each week, you aren't guaranteed two days off in a row which can be brutal."
good,"I worked first shift for the company. I have learned professional, customer service and leadership skills. Management was fair. I would recommend the company if it was not closing."

good,"A team of friendly associates lead by a manager and team lead who's primary goal is to help you succeed on both a corporate and personal level through personal coaching, learning labs, town hall meetings, corporate events, and community outreach. Management provides each associate with the tools for corporate advancement and is encouraged to do so. To consistently provide our customers with the willingness to assist with a smile on every call is no easy task. However, as a customer care representative, our job is rewarding when we focus on the customer experience."

good,"Assurant is a great place to work but for me I don't like sitting all day long I like to be moving around. I answered phone all day long and assist the cmr on helping them get a new phone with there insurance coverage, the hard part is after taking the traiing course you are on your own iwht no help."
good,My coworkers were my family. A typical day consisted of updating deposits and applying payments. I followed up on past due AR accounts and sent bi-monthly statements. I learned full cycle accounting duties and worked with great management for escalations. Our culture is based on common sense and uncommon thinking.

good,This is a call center and just like every other job it has its good days and its bad days.

Managers were always on hand to help out if needed or if there was an issue that I wasn't able to help the customer directly with (for example, not having authorisation or the customer being unhappy about a particular condition that I was not able to resolve). The hardest but most interesting part of the job was calming down and helping irate customers that were not happy with the service. The most enjoyable part of the job was when the company set up fun days or got us all free ice cream. In this job, I learnt by the customer's voice how patient I needed to be and when to particularly cautious about them calling with a complaint.

The co-workers was great. You feel like family with them and we had a good time. Your co-workers have a listed of work to do and you guys work as a team to get it done. The hardest thing about the job is calling in to some of the insurance company and they don't give you the information and then you have to call the homeowner or the other numbers on the account to get the information.The enjoyable part about the job is working on your own pace and getting the overtime.

They work to help you succeed and grow in the claims process. The hardest part of the job is the hours I work.My wife also work there and she is on first shift. The most enjoyable part of the job I would say is to find errors that may hold up the homeowners draws or inspection process and to fix them and keep everything moving in a timely manner."

The campus is great, has on-site daycare, elementary school, employee cafeteria, credit union, gym, and convenience store -- in addition to a beautiful lake with walking trail, tennis courts, and basketball court....oh, and the ping pong and foosball tables in the lounge area. The compensation is generous and if you're a good team player and are willing to help out and have a good work ethic they do what they can for you. And even though I'm part of a restructure and will be leaving the company soon, I can't say enough positive things; I really enjoyed my time here."
good,Assurant provides every opportunity to grow and learn about insurance. The management team/staff are AMAZING! The training is very detailed and when you get to the floor you immediately know what you're doing to be the best at your role. I would definitely recommend working here. the only downfall would be the pay but compared to other companies it is pretty good. overall one of the best companies I am glad I work for!!
good,"The only downside for me was the pay, and how long it would take me to advance to a livable wage in the position I’m in. They’re very much into promoting within, but that doesn’t really help much if you’re like me and none of the positions above you interests you. "

I work with experienced professionals and I enjoy the professional environment. There are many activities for employees which brings a sense of community to our company. I cannot say that there is a most difficult part of the job, however, what I find most challenging is the over two hour commute to and from work in the Atlanta traffic (which is part of the reason I am choosing to live in a smaller city). The most enjoyable part: I feel secure in my position and successful and I enjoy the people I work with."

I looked forward to going to work everyday. I would say the hardest part of my most recent position there would have to be having to work with a manager that did not know anything about the department procedures and I had to depend on my Team Lead to do all of the managers job, but the manager did the associate reviews and did not go to the team lead for insight on how we was doing. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping customers with their insurance claims and getting them back to their normal lives."

Not exactly a challenging job. It could be marked as ""fast paced"" but honestly I sat in front of a screen for 8 hours a day and keyed in names and numbers that appeared on the screen.

I was working at the office for about 6 months and my manager gave me the opportunity to WFH and I took it! Even though I’m at home I still get support as if I was in the office. Time management is a VERY big thing in the company, I have seen several coworkers get fired because they just could not get to work on time or were coming back from break late consistently. Overall great company to work for with so many opportunities to grow within the company all over the US."

The atmosphere was friendly, team work, business focused. I learned to trust the training I received for making sound decisions regarding health care insurance."

In the nearly 16 years that followed, I was afforded many opportunities for career advancement, and always felt that my contributions were appreciated.
