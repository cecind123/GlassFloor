rating,review
bad,Safety As long as it does interfere with productivity.  There was in fighting on who should run thing. and made people do needless busy work for no good reason. and if you did do they punish you for it.
bad,"you have people that don’t carry their weight they just kiss As* and the few people that do work hard end up doing there job and someone else’s , they make up rules as they go, you can’t go to H.R. for help because they pretend like the employee hand book doesn’t matter, so there is no one to help resolve even miner issues, so the poor management gets to pick and choose what, when and how they hire, fire, and promote. So I would recommend that if you come here to work have your lips ready!!!"
bad,Managment is not good for workers they bring in new management to cut jobs treat people like slaves the union is a joke and does not defend the workers they are in bed with the company
bad,Do not fill out an application at this modern day slave plantation period.If you want a life outside of this h@ll forsaking place please don't apply for a job here real talk!!!!!!!
bad,"The days are too long, they do not provide very good training, and very poor management. Mandatory overtime or else! Dirty and hot, they don't care about you, its always the company before the employees."
bad,Factory work is for losers. The supervisor on A shift has a chip on his shoulder. I work in the car business now as a finance manager so i make way more money than him enjoy the heat losers!!!!
bad,Management and human resources suck the atmosphere sucks just everything about the place sucks cant speak up about anything the union is a joke all around the place is a joke
bad,The management sucks if you don’t move fast enough they get rid of you i was only there 3 weeks on training and i got a phone call on the third day of my third saying not to go in without an explanation! That place is ridiculous.
bad,When I first started Owen's Corning was a place I was proud of to work and tell people I worked for. But new management has made a poor quality product and doesn't seem to care about the people at all.
bad,worked 13 years in a union environment as management. Very challenging as a Supervisor and very unfair when trying to perform other jobs. Worked as a Scheduler and Warehouse Supervisor but still was not recognized.
bad,This company will hire you and provide zero training and throw you to the wolves. Then ask you to do horrible things to the Union workers. Then when you refuse they will cut you lose. Worst place I ever worked. Long hours bad leadership team
bad,Not a good place to work for men or people of color they are racist and not empathetic work you like a slave cant keep people there its not a good place to work
bad,"Very bad air quality."
bad,"Horrible. Not a good place to work. They do not care about their employees, They do not compensate accordingly and they do not offer the best health care benefits."
bad,"I have worked for companies big and small.  OC was and still is the very worst place I have ever worked.  Management priorities changed at the drop of a hat, with no warning or follow through."
bad,Management is bad they don't communicate with the employees they say there all about safety but work the employees to the ground and only care about numbers they lie to employees and don't keep us in any decisions
bad,"Owens Corning in Springfield TN is a horrible place to work."
bad,"It was a good place to work when I started , But management was changed and everything changed as well. "
bad,Diversity hires don't need to work.  All blame goes on the white working guy.  All the success is given to under achieving diversity hires.  Upper management openly lies that does care about the environment or people.
bad,Management sucks they don’t care about their employees they are very racist at this company and treat you like you don’t matter outta all jobs this is by fair the worst job ever had I would never recommend this company to nobody
bad,"Nothing good to say regarding this employer. Happy my time is over there. Work was awful, management never knew what was going on, policy, goals, and objectives change every day. Also the company is ruled by nepotism."
bad,"Towards end of employment, they were firing guys left and right for any and everything so they would not have to pay them unemployment during the furnace rebuild. Managers have no training and its more of a ""do as you're told or i'll fire you"" type of attitude with majority of them. Pay is poor for the work you do and auditors always seeking ways to make their jobs relevant by picking on the worker bees."
bad,I trained on 1st shift and then moved to 3rds. 3rd shift is a big joke. The supervisor let his lead run the show and do what she wanted. I was often thrown on jobs I hadn't been trained on and was expected to know what I was doing and to hit rate. 1 job in particular was extremely rough on the back but lead never cared. All the people you worked with were backstabbers. Talked bad about 1 person behind their back and then acted like their friend the next. Wouldn't recommend for a long time Career AT ALL.
bad,"i learned to have experience in different job functions "
bad,This is a very aggravating job to have. Some of the management are decent and great people to get to know but others have no idea how to be an effective manager they sit in the office and watch youtube videos. They won't promote from within they hire friends that cant manage a shift and has caused very poor employee moral. The machines are breaking down multiple times per shift and work day it's a wonder that the place is making a profit.
bad,"The Lakeland, FL plant runs so lean that a single person calling out could cause the whole plant to shut down due to not enough personnel to cover issues that may arise. If you wish to take a vacation day or sick day then it is your responsibility to get coverage and if you do not get coverage you risk getting a point toward getting disciplined through suspensions or getting fired. The pay is below the average for the area with little to no advancement opportunities available. The management team does not help the production workers when short handed even though they came from the production team. There is very little support all around and there are multiple pieces of equipment that are broken in areas all over the plant that the production workers are expected to risk their lives to run them for very little pay. The maintenance team is either understaffed or unable to fix issues due to not having adequate parts/tools to fix issues and thus are forced to come up with home made fixes which don't fix the issue, but instead just delay it breaking again for a short time. They installed a new production line without upgrading any of the systems to handle the extra work load, thus causing machines and pipes to wear down much faster and in some cases simply unable to handle the extra load. There are more days that we are so busy that we are unable to take a break on a 12+ hour shift than calm days that allow for breaks."
bad,"Be careful about taking a temp job with this facility, unless you intend on making this only as just that: a very temporary stop, and moreover, if you genuinely tend to fit into a “good ole boys” network. I use to think that term was just a cliché, until what I witnessed for three months. This location is also run-down, drab, downtrodden, and at times, disgusting (the restrooms and kitchen are deplorable and almost never cleaned, and were due for a refurbishment probably last century). Worst of all, I and others have ben lied to about perm status by first shift supervisors and the one-person HR team (who seemingly is gone half the time either on vacation or traveling to conventions). Not on the up, and a certain “team lead” as she is loosely referred to by other staff), is a downright awful person: zero people skills and out to subjugate others to her misery. But with the HR person always AWOL, you are best off letting such people carry on with their miserable lives. The immature temper tantrums and throwing of product by a higher-up in the Safety Department was something also that seemed to surreal to believe in the year 2019."
bad,Wouldn’t advise being employed by this company in Houston Texas... a coworker tried to attack me and they had it on video and they still fired me with him... they knew they were wrong so they gave me some what of a severance package and didn’t dispute my unemployment... I should have gotten a lawyer and sued
bad,worst place to work they are racist they discrimination and disrespectful only a few chose ones can advance long hours small pay its hurry up and shut up
bad,the best thing is the benfits but other then that U have managers that cnt read that being disrespectful to u at all times. U have to put ur Family last.
bad,They fired me and refused to give reason two days before Xmas they screwed you on your breaks and strict rules wouldn’t even allow to go to locker  was good on time do my work and booted like trash
bad,"It is not great place to work, always pressures, Union problems, Political influence, cast feelings, Regional Feelings, No proper recognition, No value for good talent"
bad,"Hands down the worst place I have ever worked for work home balance. The structure is from the 70's with a completely reactive culture. If you are willing to give your life to a company, this is for you."
bad,You have to find your own work to do. No management direction. Can't trust anyone. Always have to watch what you do and what you say. Look Busy. I wouldn't work here unless you could secure a position at toledo.
bad,"Tell us about:"
bad,"Owens Corning was once a decent place to work at, pre-2007! Working here you had to be able to deal with a difficult 7 day rotating schedule (one weekend a month) and NOW have to deal with a difficult 12 hour (two weekends off a month) schedule with hardly any family time either way while salary employees enjoy family life. Expecting employees to do 2 man jobs now, treating their long tenured employees like nothing, demoting employees to save a buck because of their famous quote ""It's a business decision"", yet have money to buy bagels every Friday, eat out fancy dinners during Christmas and buy worthless machinery like the unitizer robots that are collecting dust because they did not work. FREEZING PENSIONS for the few workers pre-2007(under 45) while the union let it happen when they stated we were the cut off before going to 401k for newer employees."
bad,"Just look in the restroom in the plant "
bad,"I would never recommend this job to anyone I like. You will be over worked, lied to about rotating shift, and it has a disrespectful management. It is also under staffed and unsafe."
bad,"Long probation, rushed and unprofessional “training”.  Equipment is ALWAYS broken.  Extremely low company moral.  There’s almost always a fear of losing your job.  Union doesn’t do anything about issues or bullying in the work place.  One of the WORST experiences in this lifetime."
bad,"Place did not care about your home life, or being fair to anyone. They changed printed rules whenever they wanted to to fit any situation they needed to change. The place ran on 1 persons mood for the day. No advancement, they had set in mind who was going to advance before the opportunity arrived. Gave 1 person a supervisor spot on his 4th time rehired instead of anyone in the plant. Made money, but they didnt allow for anything else and if you took vacation which was a benefit there, they would replace you accusing you of quitting."
bad,"Not everyone can make it, you are on fear of lossing your job constantly for first 3 months. Fiberglass is always in the air and in your clothes.  You do get forklift certified and they take good care of the employees that make it past the probation period. The pay is great"
bad,"This place used to be a great place to work, good management, overall great job. In the last few years this place has gone way down hill, they can't get people to work there anymore, both in production and in the maintenance side of the job. People are leaving this place in numbers,I would not tell anyone I know to work there. The union side is great people, management is not so good."
bad,If I had to do this job again I'd never take it. Lies from management from the start. More mismanagement than professional management. And they tell you to your face your life don't matter.
bad,"They fired me a week before Christmas because of missing my 90th day due to a legit medical issue. There are no excused absences. You miss a day, you get a point. Late(even on a voluntary overtime day), half a point. No regard for employee home life whatsoever and no gratitude for your work. Starting pay is alright."
bad,Very Stressful you dont get a chance to advance unless you know someone. Management sucks. Would not recommend anyone to work here.Too much micro management.They are  all out to get you and write you up for anything.OT is unfair.
bad,the pay is good if you will work every day. the company doesnt care about you at all just a tool in the machine. lots of overtime is available so that was a plus
bad,I hated my time working there. Management will treat you like garbage just because they have a bad day. Unless you know someone there you don’t move up. They occasionally do layoffs
bad,"Some of the managers were nice while others were rude, same thing with the people I worked with, the pay is great, the bits of glass that fall into your eyes on a daily basis is not, no matter how good you think your safety goggles are, u better check again, was also supposed to work 45 days, but they laid us off after two weeks and one week later they were going to start back up, but I got the flu, even have the paperwork from the e.r. but they don't care, was let go, we didn't even get to pack on the line like we were supposed to, they had us busy doing other stuff, they were unprepared, and hired on way to many temps at once and then kept hiring tons more, there's no a/c and it's very humid, oh yay another warehouse that's probably a billion dollar company that can't afford a/c"
bad,The company took Mexican workers green cards as a threat to them. Would not give them or me safety equipment to work around deadly processes. When I became sick because I worked around unsafe places they fired me. I Complained to AZ commission an got the job back due to their false statements. I the quit.
bad,"It was a stressful environment with dangerous work.  It was a  unsafe place to work at. "
bad,owens stinks its hot than heck fumes bad midnights stinks they did buy food a lot they exspect a lot but don't pay a lot I would never work there again or refer any one there
bad,"Your experience here totally depends on your manager.  I had one manager who was excellent.  I was promoted.   Raise.  People loved my work.  My manager transitioned departments.  I had a new manager who was extremely religious and had a serious problem with my sexuality (she found out after I ran into her at a restaurant).  Everything totally changed when she found out and she harassed me.  Called me names.  Bullied me non-stop.  I talked to HR but the HR woman for my department happened to be the person my boss has lunch with almost daily.  She started looking for any little thing to fire me and eventually made something up.  It's a shame.  I liked the company for the most part, but it made me miserable working for her and the company can't pretend to be inclusive if certain managers can act however they want."
bad,Make lunch free or increase the payment. Give accommodation so that it will more helpful for us. Over all I am happy. Your management is good.
bad,"utilize anything possible for one not to advance in a career and/or hiring process. was offered a job but then got denied due to an incident that occured back in August, 2015."
bad,"Constant drama , constant threat of being laid off. It is nasty extremly unsafe , and you will get burned with scars ,and get glass fibers in you every part of your body. You will breathe this glass constantly and it will get in your car clothes , if you have kids they will get it in them also no matter what you do!"
bad,"The people here are great to work with for the most, but the management leaves a lot to be desired.  There is a lot of favortism in this company.  They sound great, but they aren't great to work for."
bad,not satisfied with some of the thing that took place while i was at the company but overall its was a good workplace
bad,First:
bad,The only good thing about OC was the pay and the fact that it is a union plant. Management is completely disconnected! Safety is reactive instead of proactive! High school drama everywhere you turn along with the rumor mill!
bad,"Worst plant I have ever been employed at. The work itself is fairly easy but the terrible leaders make it hard.  Also if you're buddies with the Operating Manager or related to one of his pals you can call out whenever you want. As much as you want, with no consequences. The safety managers are more concerned with harassing certain employees, messaging on Facebook and instigating fights than actually making the plant safer. I actually witnessed one shove an employee and call him a ""N"" word but the nice sized weekly checks help you overlook certain things. Operation literally shuts down everyday due to terrible maintenance on the machinery. The label machine at the palletizor hasn't worked for the 2 years I've been employed. And the best part is if the O.M decides you're not one of his buddies you get a drug test every 2 weeks until they get tired of wasting their money"
bad,The atmosphere is very negative. As a utility worker you are treated like scum by some of the techs that have been there for years. No one wants to be outperformed so they will literally sabotage your work to make sure you do not get promoted. Do not work here.
bad,i liked the job but the management did not care to work with you and they tried to make you work all the time with no overtime and they dint wat ro work well with the employees and always threatend to fire them
bad,Owens is productive and well ran. I would not recommend it for single parents that have little to no help with babysitting. I also wouldn’t recommend it to anyone with sensitive skin or any type of skin condition.
bad,"Management is lost. College degrees but no experience. They dont know good talent. No electrical work, even though the title says Electro- Mechanical Tech."
bad,On a daily basis the job environment was extremely stressful.  Management was absolutely horrible.  HR Did absolutely nothing to fix work issues.  Supervisors and the line operators on 2nd shift for the Owen's Corning Thermafiber in Wabash Indiana stand around all day on their phones and walk around and sit in the foreman's office. And when something messes up they yell at the production crew and they stand around and watch the production crew struggle when insulation starts coming off the conveyors and laugh instead of helping their workers
bad,"Working the job itself was ok but I never wanted to touch anything other than what I had too, tobacco chew spit everywhere. The bathroom/locker room always smelt gross. Most coworkers are vulgar and rude! It was very uncomfortable for me as an employee because the union and company are two and not one, so I would get scolded by the union for working to hard, and then get scolded by the company for not working hard enough, then get scolded again by the union for working to hard again and since the work force consists 80% or more of union workers I didn't know who to listen to. It was even worse when an issue between workers would arise because no-one was held responsible for there actions."
bad,Job could be better if management was properly trained. Uncomfortable work environment. Typical day is getting chemicals sprayed on you. Management does not care about employees
bad,"Maintenance not really maintenance, no work life balance. You can almost die in a car wreck and be in the hospital and still will get wrote up. They try to tell you how to do your job even if they don’t know how to do it themselves. Work you 70 plus hours a week everyday no days off then get upset if you decide to take a day off after you worked a month straight. The more you learn and more jobs you know doesn’t equal up to higher pay, it just means you will get used a lot. You get paid the same as a person that knows only 1 job and you can know 2 or 3"
bad,"Could be a nice place to work. Management is dysfunctional, union protects the lazy and does nothing for the hard working guy except take his cash. There is zero accountability, they never fire anyone, just move them along to some other job."
bad,"Management top to bottom is poor. No accountability or sense of urgency what so never. Planning is very bad which has led to a huge spike in customer complaints and on time delivery problems. No regard for the people who know the jobs input. No regard for work, Life balance. Labor is stretched to thin. Would not recommend working here."
bad,"laid off without notice, aftern working there for four months , they claimed that they would put me on as a regular employee but did not."
bad,"Lots of favoritism from management especially if you actually do your job and excel at it well. But if your ""LAZY""your more likely to be buddy buddy with management. So if you lazy and decide to work here be prepared to kiss alot of butt so you won't have to do as much as the ones who come here and work hard to make this craphole a successful business!!!!!"
bad,I would not recomend this place to anyone to work at. The plant engineer was allowed to run roughshod over the entire establishment. He micromanaged every aspect of the facility and purposely tried to intimidate any and everyone who worked there.
bad,If you like to be discriminated against go ahead and work for them. If you don’t like your family go work for owens Corning they don’t give you family time
bad,it is a union job which has both advantages and did advantages. they come up with procedures that leads to favoritism on picking  certain people for jobs that's totally unfair. Its a who you know and hang out with on if you'll  get the job or not on the key position jobs.
bad,Inless your a favorite of the forced union. Management his utterly horrible treating their employees like a sub specieces of insect. Rarely follow safety rules inless it is conveneint for management. The union should be brought up on charges for cooruption. Hard to tell what roll they play within the company as they do nothing but take money from your check without permission.
bad,"This is based on experience at the Springfield, Tn plant only.  You work in itchy insulation to begin with, then they will hire the least possible amount of employees and dump too massive of a workload on them all while preaching Safety, Safety, Safety.  Turnover is extremely high volume which just lends more evidence to the poor management.  Hence they can't keep people and are always trying to hire."
bad,"Only way to really succeed is with an MBA and few ethics and little integrity. If you are ready to sell yourself out and disregard your employee's needs for your personal wants, you will go far."
bad,"HR treats non salary employees like little children. Supervisors have a ton of pressure from the out of touch with reality plant leader so it trickles down. If your Mom or Dad work there, you are a golden child  and can walk into any job you please. Definitely two sets of personnel manuals. One for the people they like and one for the ones they don't. Equipment runs like its already 80 years old. They've been running almost 2 years now. Its good money but it comes at a price and I doubt they will even be around in 10 years. Don't see it being a profitable venture at all. Thats a shame because there are some really good people that work there."
bad,"Goods: Pay, benefits, stock purchase plane, 401K is automatic vested 2% and match additional up to 6% for a total of 8%. "
bad,Una empresa que se enfoca en su producción y no en seguridad. Aunque ellos dicen lo contrario. Muy fatigada. El ambiente no es muy bueno. Al menos existe gente prepotente. Los coach no toman encerio su trabajo. Y su calidad está disminuyendo por lo mismo que la gente ni está contenta. La comida en los 2 y 3 turno está del asco. Salario de 900 pesos.
bad,"They work you a slave, show favoritism and are under staff which forces other employees to work mandatory overtime, stay away! No real concern about safety and managers thinks it's ok to talk to you any type of way. Management very unorganized."
bad,"I spent two years at a technical fabrics plant. The job had been advertised as desirous of employing standard work and improving plant performance. The plant performance expectations lived up to the billing, but the commitment by plant management to implementing and growing standard work coverage wavered, based on extremely limited resources and customer demands. The on-site human resources representative was spread out over three plants, in three very geographically separated states. Plant manager did not know how to communicate expectations."
bad,"fixed production, no scope for your technical knowledge.No balance in your education and the work you are doing there."
bad,"OC was one of the worst jobs I've had.. poor management, no set schedules, people who show up every day to watch others work while they do nothing and managers that show favoritism towards others. Rules only apply to some and not everyone.  The people who work hard are not valued. I had many times my hrs was short on my  paycheck"
bad,"Even though they say you you will not be working with fiberglass, the material you do work with is definitely all over you by the end of your shift. The conditions are extremely hot in the summer and very fast paced depending on what line you are working on.  Old equipment and not even working fans to help move the air in some areas. Mandatory overtime and poor attitudes from coworkers. Would never suggest anyone work in the Tiffin, Ohio plant."
bad,Good independent talent structure & processs. Project PMP standard while merger and acquisition business process acquire company. Training center on calendar. Slow growth in long term goal.
bad,"Enjoyed working at owens corning .Great benefits Good pay and team work.would recommend this company to anyone looking for a job.Best job I've"
bad,"In all the work was easy, data entry and minor physical labor. However, in downtime situations cleaning was the focal point. The environmental conditions did not play well when combined with the physical exertion. Management is secular and offset from production.  "
bad,"I worked from home and was responsible for four plants in the south.  I reported to an HR lead in Toledo. There were occasional phone conversations. I was limited in my travel to the plants. This made the work difficult. We mutually agreed to separate after a year as the company declared bankruptcy, Poor marriage."
bad,"12 hr workday. Start with 15 min safety huddle. Then operate & troubleshoot in a position for 12 hours. Learned a lot about time management, gained some factory wherewithal. The work can get tough, but typically it is not. Training is a work in progress. Management is good but minimal, easily overloaded. Domineering & predatory long-timers. Culture is very “tribal”. Typically when someone speaks, nobody but that person knows anything. The individual people are mostly good. The hardest part is the culture. The most enjoyable part is teamwork on the line."
bad,"The savannah plant is one of the WORST plants to work for. The management only cares about certain people advancing. They feed you lies to make you believe they are going to help you advance and the decide to advance someone else. Safety management is always harrassing certain employees. If another employee calls out of work you're expected to stay over. I've had to stay as long as 20 hours. "
bad,"The Veterans run the place,not the NLT. They (veterans) do what they want,when they want.  Lots of favoritism/racism. It all depends on who likes you. LOTS of discrimination!"
bad,It was ok til the plant closed down. we werent sure what we were going to do with our careers after the plant shut down. It was a nice severance package
bad,Working with 500 degree asphalt is extremely dangerous
bad,I learned several things working here at this company it was just the hours we worked. shift I worked was 3 to 11 we had to work everyday since the tear started
bad,"Typical day included far too many meetings and little progress toward process improvement. Resources were scarce - people and equipment. Management stifled innovation. The plant leader was incompetent and proved he was only concerned with keeping his job secure. Poor leadership from the top, including general management, would not or could not take necessary calculated risks. Project management at the local level was extremely poor. Safety of employees began to take a backseat to production volume - encouraged by plant leader. Product quality was excellent, but product is very expensive, particularly in terms of transportation costs. I would not recommend this company to anyone - particularly this facility."
bad,It's easy work for good pay but the Temps aren't treated fairly.  Night shift takes hour long breaks. Gets messy pretty quickly but it's easy to clean up.
bad,In Indian Owens Corning Bm plant.there is no different between operational engineer and daily labours.work like causal.
bad,"While the salary was good, the culture and work atmosphere were largely unprofessional. There was clearly a lack of managerial cohesiveness, which led everyone to cover his/her own butt. Disappointing and I expected much more from an organization of this size. "
bad,cover yourself in writting  with everything.  company verbal agreements.... do not agree unless its in writing and follow through with a time period ...from  start date to end
bad,company talks about promoting from within and safety being the most important and it is all lies.  Turnover is high and the management could care less.
bad,Its a clean atmosphere but it doesn't pay very well. its swing shifts so you don't get a straight schedule. You work 12 hour shifts but only get 2 breaks.
bad,"No advancement, lazy employees are not disciplined and let to make others do their work. Very understaffed, and people that are there seem to be looking for employment elsewhere. Safety/EHS is a hinderance in doing your job to what upper management expects."
bad,"Ik heb in nog geen ander bedrijf zoveel mensen zien ontslagen worden."
bad,"Staffed far too lean, very poor life / work balance, little to no room for advancement, very stressful working conditions, very long working hours with frequent call ins on nights weekends holidays and vacations."
bad,"I worked there for over 20 years.  A lot of lying, a lot of back stabbing, finger pointing.  Broken promises made to new employees by management.  The company is not loyal to its workers. The new plant manager  seems to be there to clean house by  getting ride of older employees and hiring on a newer set for less money.  The company  I think is a good company, but the people at the roofing plant are not."
bad,good. good life balance. good to live in NY. strong culture. good management. good people
bad,"when i get to work made sure to talk to the day shife sprayer to see what order thay were working on ,and how fare thay were on is,how fare on the stacking was going ,how much glue was in the barral,if thay needed to order any damiged ones communicate the informating whith the other coworkers if need be,"
bad,"Before 2007 Owens Corning was  a great place to work good benefits good people good pay and benefits......... I started as a packer then went to stretch went to the warehouse and then eventually went to tar paper pit my last job was forming Tech, I do remember when the company had a.m. idea for all the employees to come up with suggestions cost-cutting suggestions and I came up with the idea of instead of using compressed air in the sludge pit for the Spinners I invented an idea to use recycled water and it's save the company thousands of dollars a year in the cost of the compressed air. The 5S program safety program was a great program too...."
bad,"Almost 15 yrs ago."
bad,No longer a company working much beyond office politics.  Regretfully execs are more concerned with who gets credit vs value of the work completed.  Very little praise for work completed - assumption that anything even discussed is already complete and then you're asked why you haven't done more...and getting resources on a project is nearly impossible.  There's a reason they haven't grown over past 20 years...
bad,Very poor management that likes to give you a title so you think you are someone.  If you are a thinker and like to give your honest opinion than this place is not for you.  If you are a kissy you will fit right in.
bad,Communicte with the management of the previous shift to see if there were any problems with machinery or quality or schedule issues.
bad,After interview I was excited to work at this company and was happy to work with company. I get knowledge about TPM and safety in training period and techincal knowledge
bad,"It can be stressful at times however, mostly it is a decent job. The company is quite underwhelming when it comes to management though. It could be alot better if corporate would step in and handle the issues at the management level."
bad,"Sometimes they pressure you a little to much, they push you really hard and blame it on you if no one else keeps up rate, they don't take the time to talk or understand"
bad,At this job you really don't have enough time to adjust to the curriculum without a lot being demanded of you. The trainers sometimes leave you out to hang and let you learn by yourself.
bad,I didn't have the pleasure to work there for long since they closed down our office I only worked there for 2 months it would've been nice if I worked there longer.
bad,The area is in the high desert and therefore there is not a lot to do. I had a great apartment .
bad,"OMG! I would run from working at this place!  They treat you like a number rather then a person. In the Customer sevice arena it has turned into a call Center. They base results on how many calls you take, how many calls you lost,"
bad,This placed is very fast paced. You will get dirty and it’s will be an everyday thing. So if you don’t like getting dirty this job isn’t for you. The culture there is great.
good,"I would not recommend working on third shift, first shift employees are great to work with if they stick to work related things. it get extremely hot in the summer so drink plenty of water"
good,Managers at this facility micro manage to the point they are very unprofessional and disrespectful....Not a place to work unless you lack dignity or self worth.
good,Management sucked!! Well the plant manager and safety person did anyway! Instead of doing what is right they do what is best for them.
good,People are very bad for gossip. Pay is good. Hours can be long on summer days. Enjoyed the work not so much the people. Work is not hard. Just have to be willing to work. They tend not to care about the people only the work.
good,The management here is terrible with the big expansion happening there is disregard for the constant changing of schedules and placing current and new memebres everywhere which increases the risk or safety and effectiveness of doing your job
good,I got hurt on the job there pulling fiberglass and was seen by two different doctors who stated that I needed an MRI done and to see an Orthopedic Doctor. 4 days later I was fired from my job and they stopped all workers comp.
good,Lot of driving( Forklift) alone with unloading and staging materials. Communicating with Co- workers and customers.
good,Place is filled with advance technology weather its a drive or plc they have it
good,The place itself is fine no real issues. Besides maybe some safety scares here and there. But as all jobs go no matter how good if the managers suck the job isnt worth it. Unfortunately I missed out on possibly an amazing career because of poor management. I mean I have an uncle who literally is sleeping everyday working there making 40+ an hour maybe more than that. He buys new cars like every year because he gets bored. So the pay is fantastic. Most of the safety issues are on you as well unless you are like me and have not so great management that doesnt do things like they should and then throwing you to the wolves.
good,"The pay was good, but it seemed as if there was no balance there. The place ran 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. There wasn't at all any balance to live"
good,Wouldnt  have been bad if they truly cared about safety as they said they did. It seemed as if they only really  were after numbers which is good but you have to take into consideration everything you  do takes time while being safe.
good,"Its decent if you are anything else besides a Fork lift operator, zero job advancement is allowed from this role and little to no pay raises are afforded. Management at the Joplin Thermafiber plant is less than satisfactory and the HR department is nonexistent."
good,"Owens Corning pays good but not a fun job. Every job I was in line to move up in was being eliminated."
good,Found to be hierarchical. People are very nice and for the most part easy to work with. Great location that was just re-done inside. Onsight gym was a bonus.
good,Long hours and Rotating shift are very hard.a very far commute no breaks only lunch break no feed back from management .loads were all done on a Rf system
good,"pushed to work at a competitive pace"
good,"Schedule changes, schedule by reward and punish."
good,okay company if you don't mind the hours and climate change. in the summer factory can get extremely hot and super cold in the winter time. All shifts are 12 hours meaning there are long weeks and short weeks. with weekly pay
good,"We had over three months of training while the plant was being finished. OSHA 10, forklift operator, fall prevention, etc. The culture was of chosen few who had the run of the place. Nothing much,              Working with some good people."
good,"Stressful environment if you can get past that and deal with poor middle management most jobs are not that complicated. Biggest drawback is not enough employees to cover all positions. There's really no advancement other than to foreman which is rare. Expection is Owenscornimg is all, first and foremost."
good,I received bonuses plus salary company went out of business. Overall it was a good company. Scheduling appointments for water proofing basements.
good,very large company that bought and sold plants for profit. not socialy responsible in this area. Hard to make a committment to.
good,learn something new everyday.
good,Los Supervisores y personal  son muy prepotentes todo lo piden de mala gana
good,they might pay good but they know they can replace you in a second and will do anything to make you feel its your fault. they have been sued many times for many things.
good,"Well seemed good when starting there but they do have big problems between management and the union. Their speaker system sounds like a dying cat and we were suppose to understand anything that someone said over it??? Spent two weeks shoveling insulation on a belt while workers came over and asked in disbelief, "" No one has trained you on the bagging machines yet???"" I said no then sent back to shovel more insulation on a belt. Then finally training and a week and a half later I was not keeping up enough even though everyone was telling me I was doing great. They say they have changed their HR ways but its still 50 and 60 year old union members who you never meet having meetings you are not invited to making decisions. You do not just bag there, there are 4 or 5 different machines to learn, computer systems and how to stop machines from jamming all while you are going like Speedy Gonzalas trying to keep up with bags. People there were good and friendly but come on guys you really need to come up with a better training program and at least give people 3 months for probation before they let you go. Very mixed up there."
good,Overall this is a fine place to work. Good people and descent supervisors. This is an assembly line position so it can be very mundane.                 .
good,"Working st Owens corning is not that bad. However. The management is very poor. For example, Slack of decision. Also in my plant we have been working 13 days and 1 day off for about 2.5 years. That is not good if you have family. The pay is fair. Slack of advancement and growing opportunities if want to climb to a office position. Envi"
good,If you go through a temp agency you have countless lay offs. If you can get in through the company pay is extraordinary. Extreme heat conditions but get longer breaks to cool off.
good,"Owens Corning is a absolute awesome company as a whole. Unfortunately, the local plant leader is what is holding the plant back from success. The plant leader has driven this plant into the ground. About a year ago, we finally got a department leader in who actually cares and was capable of leading our improvement and our plant leader fired him. The Plant leader does not know what he is doing and will continue to drag the plant down unless someone removes him. He failed in every position he has been in here. SOMEONE NEEDS TO DO SOMETHING IMMEDIATLY!!!!!"
good,some incentives but all production driven. lot of family working there and not easy to voice your opinions for fear of offending multiple people. But overall steady employment and decent healthcare
good,Ik heb fijn gewerkt bij Owens Corning. Jammer dat de crisis er tussen kwam. Leuk aspect was dat ik de talen weer kon gaan gebruiken.
good,"The product was extremely expensive and had reached the limit of it's effectiveness,"
good,"Typical place to work . people are nice, hardest thing would be the fiberglass(itch) and heat"
good,"I worked in a warehouse which means whatever the weather is outside is what it’ll be inside the warehouse, and it’d be extremely hot during the summer."
good,The work itself wasn't too bad but the heat during the summer combined with being covered with fiberglass insulation made it miserable you are underpaid when you consider the elements that you are required to deal with and they are very insistent on exceeding production rates
good,"With our specific plant being unionized, there are certain perks such as great pay and job protection to an extent. The problem with the plant being unionized is the cutthroat attitude salary seems to have in trying to find reasons to fire union workers."
good,"I used Epsco to get a job at Owens Corning--where I operated a press and was introduced to excessive heat conditions.I was glad fro the experience ,but don't miss the conditions,heat ,etc."
good,While employed there the company went through a downsizing/RIF. Had good relationship with the sites I supported and helped to sites achieve OSHA VPP Star.
good,"Could be a good stepping stone for moving up, two to three year position max.  Can move up within company but must relocate to move up.  Not a place to stay long term."
good,"Was the most stressful job I ever had, the way they trained you to sell was very high pressure sales, I was able to do the job for a short period of time due to what you put the customers through."
good,"Productive work place"
good,I enjoyed the job there was limited advancement.  I had to make the hard choice to leave the company.  I enjoyed everyone I worked with and still communicate with them.
good,"Company is production driven.  Processed work orders and scheduled work to be done for the day."
good,"I was a temp at this company I had no job security and pay way not the greatest. But I enjoyed  the people I worked with and liked my job,"
good,"A typical day at Owen's Corner was you never really knew what you doing or where you would be working."
good,"Did payrolls for seven manufacturing plants and about 3500 employees. Hardest part of the job is that they were weekly payrolls. "
good,While this was a good place to begin my career it is very limited at the top and has change significantly over the past couple years and not in positive ways.
good,"good place to work. solid schedule, good pay , good benifits. just moved away."
good,"I think there are a few talented people within the ranks, but inclusion is hard when working with a union environment. The management team want change, but do not know how to go about it. There is a rift of dis-trust within employees and their work reflects it. "
good,"Alot of pressure to keep your opinion to your if you want your job, working condition very hot drink water,h have to work well with other abilities to work with other"
good,I was a HOA certified as HOP Fiberizer. Hot end opperator and shift safety officer. I felt there was no way to progress any further due to union members via pension advancement. Also the environment was not healthy. Very misty with high concentrations of citric acid in the air. 12 hr shifts 3 on 3 off rotating nights and days took its toll
good,Lot laid off every year  Because slow business or market.its ok to work but every year busines change and cost to people get to live the company every time
good,The pay was good the health insurance was so so they paid for preventive but out of pocket max for family was high. There were some great employees and some bad employees like anywhere else the management ran a high performance organization which means little to no supervision I personally like this system but it did create backstabbing and tattling on employees this was encouraged by management and rewarded seeing this is the only way they knew or thought they knew what was going on on the floor
good,productive and coworkers are awsome people to work with.the work is not hard.good place tp work if your not allergic to fiberglass.and you get everyother weekend off.
good,"Plant closed, poor organization. This was a union shop. Union made people lazy. Lazy people don't work, plant closed, need I say more. "
good,"Contacto con todas las áreas, aprendizaje sobre los proces de producción, recorridos en planta por los expertos."
good,It was a good job a little low pay and almost no retirement no 401K at the time. Good thing was the training program very good on going training good place for an apprentice to learn skills in industrial arts.
good,it was a alright company had to work a lot of hours. the Job had it's time where you would have to really work hard. when machines was running good it was ok
good,Being a new company there are a lot of headaches and that is one thing that you have to deal with. There are to many chiefs and not enough Indians. To much micro managing.
good,"Owens Corning is a solid business, but it does not have commitment to innovation. I worked in S&T at the Granville location.  The location is beautiful and convenient to Columbus"
good,"Interesting work, great co-workers for the most part."
good,"Working at the Thermafiber plant in Wabash, I can say that the people at the plant level want Thermafiber to succeed. Though there is a lot of tired individuals that are stressed and potentially overworked or mismanaged. This is a great place to learn and grow and experience a lot of unique processes and the people you will work with will truly try to educate and give you a strong chance to succeed. The hardest part is knowing when you need to take control of a situation or let someone else take control of a situation. I was working a lot of long hours trying to control a lot of things that I should have been probably pushing other people to control. I wish Thermafiber the best and hope they grow to understand what is important to plant's success and continual improvement."
good,Overall Owen's Corning was a good place to work.  I learned about different chemicals and ingredients that were used to make the products that made. Management was a little slow to respond to issues.  The climate would be the hardest part of the job in my opinion. The pay is hands down the best part.
good,"12 hour shifts in production hard to balance children "
good,"The work is as expected: PM activities, safety checks on equipment lockouts and other devices, basic cleanup duties, operation of air compressors and steam systems, and periodic audits of the different processes in the plant. The floor workers (Maintenance and Ops) work well together for the most part, but like anywhere there are exceptions to the rule. Management at the lower levels is too focused on product and not enough on people, and it shows horribly. There is a lot of ""brown-nosing"" between people in management and if the ""little guy"" doesn't engage in it then their chances of advancement or a pay raise are slim to none. A typical day wasn't that difficult to complete as long as management would stay out of the way, but those days were few and far between. The workplace culture was advertised as trying to shy away from an ""Us vs. Them"" mentality, but from the first day it was obvious that this was not the case. During the initial installation of the equipment and during the plant startup, the maintenance team (as minimal as it was at the time) pointed out multiple glaring faults in the work being performed and offered solutions for fixing those faults; however, they were completely ignored until they were noticed by higher management during the startup and testing phase. The hardest part of this job was keeping your mouth shut when it was obvious that the company was losing money due to shoddy work by your superiors, but the most enjoyable part of the job was getting to work with your hands and get a sense of accomplishment when you assisted the Operations team with a"
good,"operated shingle machine and color granular machine, drove forklift"
good,I started out here as a temp to hire and finished as the maintenance supervisor. All maintenance preformed all maintenance functions. The maintenance crew were very close knit group and were always helping each other in daily task. This be preforming the job or teaching someone how to do something new to them.
good,"People, not ineffective processes, are the scapegoat when process upsets occur. Poor union relationships at many facilities."
good,"I Really Don't Want To Rate The Company. It Pays My Bills. So With That Being Said, The Company Has Been Good To Me. Im Just Tired Of The Layoffs."
good,"en un 3er turno : salir de casa a las 5:20 am , caminar 8 calles para tomar el transporte , lleguar a la planta al 25 para las 7 y cambiarse de volada para llegar a la junta de inicio  de turno al 10 para las 7 , depues entrar al area de trabajo con el equipo de proteccion necesario , checar la condicion como nos dejan las maquinas y empezar a fibrar , no hay donde sentarse , ni recargarse , asi q practicamente pasa tu turno de pie frente a tus maquinas asignadas a esepcion de 2 o 3 veces q llegas a poder ir al baño durante las 8 horas y los 30 min de comida , te dedicas a fibrar , hacer el aseo o simplemente checar tus maquinas .la parte mas dificil del empleo es la costante exposicion a temperaturas extremas pues manejas el vdrio caliente mientras el area de trabajo se mantiene muy fria, lo q mas me gusto del trabajo es el ambiente de compañerismo"
good,llegar a el área de trabajo recibir turno y verificar que no haya rompimientos y si los hay restablecer lo mas rápido posible y a si todo el turno.
good,"I assist the HR Manager in a myriad of tasks along with accomplishing my own standard work.  "
good,"Ik werk nog steeds met veel plezier bij dit dynamisch bedrijf, waar geen dag hetzelfde is."
good,Owens Corning offers great development programs and training.
good,"When the lines were running the day went by pretty quick. The people their were easy to get along with. When I worked OT, you had to work another 8 hour shift which I did not like at all. I missed alot of time with family."
good,The overall environment was good. There are some good people that work in this facility and that plant is very well maintained. It was good to work with some of the people there.
good,"I started at this company fresh out of high school, It helped me learn how to hone my active listening skills. I learned time management, and had the ability to improve my communication skills."
good,The job wasn’t hard at all but some of the people you worked with were extremely petty. If you like rotating shifts then it’s a job for you because they rotate every two weeks
good,"Was a good company that served its purpose for my employment needs throughout the years. Nothing bad to say regarding employer, leaving due to current layoffs."
good,"There is no typical work day at Owens Corning. Every day throws something at you that you did not expect, and you will be at work for a minimun of 60 hours a week, unless you are an intern."
good,Grande apprendimento in un ambiente provocatorio
good,"Day starts the minute you hit the door (which I do not mind, makes time go by) and does not let up until you walk out the door. Management is often not present and this leads to a stressful work atmosphere for all. Many hats to be worn."
good,Union facility.  Very hard to manage.  No clear way to manage output.  No support.  I felt like Owens Corning was biding their time before shutting this facility down.
good,"Productive, work in different places each day with rotation, work family away from home. Work in extreme work conditions in the summer and pick up to 100 pound rolls."
good,If you're single and like working all the time this is the place for you. But if you have a family at home to spend time with this might not be the place for you.
good,"Typical day is spent calling on various distributors, roofing contractors, dealers, and builders.  Great at taking time to train and develop their empolyees"
good,"Good place to work until new management came in. Then it was their way and no variations."
good,Nice place to work. Competitive wages and benefits. Good schedule and decent working conditions. I would recommend this company to others in the future.
good,This job was computerized and with training from two individuals who didn't agree on how to operate the computer controls. It was extremely difficult to learn the job.
good,"I was just an intern. I bounce around from being on the downline to be working as an IT specialist, which got pretty annoying because I wasn't really at the same spot the for very long."
good,"Bonne entreprise "
good,"Owens Corning Rockford plant is a good job if you have very thick skin.  You will face abrasive personalities and occasional vacuums in leadership, but the work itself is not arduous.  Tough shift hours are somewhat offset by generous vacation and time off.  Pay rates are fair to generous, depending on how much you are willing to apply yourself.  Safety, on and off the job, is a must if you work here."
good,While I was there safety was improving the pay and benefits were declining.  It's an okay place to work but not great.  Most of management are not qualified to do what they do.
good,Empresa boa mas faz bastante tempo que trabalhei lá e não tenho muito a falar apenas me deu uma oportunidade de experiência boa.
good,"This is an okay place to work if you are looking for a manufacturing job.  They are very safety oriented and want to make sure everyone goes home the same way they showed up for work that morning.  Because of this, there are alot of medical benefits and programs that are provided to the employees."
good,"Working at Owens Corning was a great experience, except for being a temp. but sadly the plant is closing soon. So I can't recommend this job."
good,"I was hired at the same time as about 30 other people. We were hired as full time workers, got in our 90 day probation period and started getting furloughed. "
good,"It was an overall enjoyable place to be where I learned and used safety measures to complete my job duties in an non-climate controlled environment. Management was a little slow to respond to issues, but there were quite a few helpful people there."
good,"The pay and benefits are good, Supervisors need some work. Very much into safety. 12 hours days for production and 8 hours shifts for shipping. Holiday pay, There is always over time."
good,Overall a good company but not in a desirable city.  Company is investing in new talent.  Things seem a little behind here as their growth plan hasn't caught up with 21st century
good,"Old dying plant which offers nothing for young and upcoming folks."
good,"Work was done in all areas of accounting : payroll, accounts payable, journal entries, inventories and month end closing. Monthly finished goods inventories and annual and quarterly inventories of raw materials and spare parts. Very busy during closing. Busy the rest of the time. While I was there both cost accounting and accounting departments were understaffed."
good,Most of my time was spent on the shop floor interacting and solving problems with production employees. I've built wonderful relations with them. The most difficult part of the job was working in the elements.
good,"Company provide safe working environment, good benefits, updated equipment. Flexible hours various training programs support community events and employee relations programs"
good,"En Owens Corning lo más importante es la seguridad, se viven los valores de seguridad al Máximo y siempre enfocados en TPM con cero accidentes, cero desperdicios y cero fallas, en esta empresa he aprendido mucho de menejo de personal, ya que debido a la zona no se cuenta con personal debidamente capacitado y el reto es su desarrolo y entrenamiento. El entorno es bastante profesional, pero a la vez tenso debido a que trabajamos arduamente para alcanzar nuestras metas y tener buenos indicadores. La parte más difícil es la tensión debido al constante crecimiento de la planta y nuevos proyectos. He aprendido mucho a manejar situaciones de conflicto y crecimiento del personal a mi cargo."
good,"The days started with a group meeting after you would be partnered and given your tasks for the day, then you would go and try and find parts if they weren't there you would move on to the next job"
good,"Owens Corning is a good place to work but it depends on what division that you work.  The pay is fair and the other compensations have room for improvement.  Again, this will vary from division to division.  A typical day goes by fast because there is a lot do.  The co-workers are usually good people."
good,"did not work here long enough to make a review. "
good,intern. Enjoyed working on my projects. People are friendly and professional. Nice location by the airport
good,"The company was overall a good company to work for, it provided a very challenging environment that allowed me to grow professionally."
good,"Work with two other people, showcasing a customers basement."
good,"Repeatitive tasks but good international exposure.  Work with a plethora of different employees and working styles, increases your ability to work in different environments and become a better leader"
good,"It's been some time since I worked for UPS. However, I gained much experience."
good,Owens Corning is truly a global company and brings great experience in that area.
good,"Good company with a long history, the job has long Gevity but is market based and a lot of slow time, (cut back on hours)"
good,"Daily quota had to be met, which pushed me to a level of needing to accomplish this goal daily. In doing so it taught me team work and self discipline. "
good,"your day is full of work not to hard , the managment teem was grate to work with"
good,"As a Materials ananlyst, we scrubbed shingles and did many other tests on shingles to determine or verify quality."
good,I liked what I did and had wonderful co-workers and managment.
good,No day is ever the same as there are a lot of challenges in a manufacturing plant. You have to think on your feet and not be afraid to be a leader and make sound decisions.
good,"Owens Coning is Great Place to wok, one really enjoys woking here, it have a free nature& one is free to learn but after completing routine job, Org. povides free training to housewives & childerns."
good,Learned to maintain personal goals to a better life for my family. safety was job first quality. how to create a wet chop to meet productivity. the gold share was a plus three months of money increases.
good,If all you care about is the money then this job will pay. If you're looking to advance in your career then this is not the job for you. Pay is good but scheduling work days/nights is something you'll have to get used to.
good,As a contract employee l am not directly involved with the day to day plant operations.l am directly involved with the apprentice program setting up and teaching classes
good,"Typical corporation these days. Decent place to work, stressful at times. Safety rules more of a hindrance than an advantage and you're just a number. Everything is good when numbers are good,maybe even get some cold sandwiches thrown in the fridge for your shift, but as soon as something extraordinary happens and the numbers aren't good, some one is going to get the blame...and it won't be management. Nor will you have the opportunity to defend yourself. Nice people to work with"
good,"Owens corning is a great place to work, but its not good if you have a family because its takes most of your time.The summer is the busiest time of year."
good,"Great place to explore and get cross functional exposure and experience. With its Focus on safety, every employee is assured of safety. Right person in right business division gets ample opportunity to prove himself and reach great heights."
good,Monitoring a production line from start to finish and coordinating people in the correct place to complete the job. I learned to get the best out people with and without pressure.This company used a lot of temporary help which made it hard to get dependable people. nothing was hard about this job. I enjoyed leading and out doing my competitors.
good,Working at Owens Corning was hard work and paying attention to detail as well as safety. The fellow employees were fun to be around and very helpful when needed.
good,"Amerikaanse dochter onderneming met een groot bijna overdreven veiligheid - gevoel."
good,"A pretty good place to work, there are some areas that can be improved on. Most of the people are friendly and good to work with."
good,The pay is decent but the people there are iffy. The union causes people to think that they can't be fired. You pretty much do what they tell you to do.
good,"Never a dull moment."
good,Learnt creative alternative methods for stabilizing plant operatios with very optimal investments.
good,we worked as a team. I learned how to run and maintain machines I worked with. The most enjoyable part of my job was the caring people I worked with.
good,you can lean how to make roof shingles the work is not for the faint at hart you work a 12 hour shift 3 days on 4 day off on one week.then the next week it is switches.
good,"It's a good place to work with a lot of nice people. Pay is also fair and solid. Work on sound proofing material for washers, dish washers, and other appliances."
good,"Help keep the production line going at all cost. High amount of hours worked weekly, sometimes mandatory 16 daily hours. Assist other areas on production problems."
good,It would be new for every day learning new things continuously. Tough scenarios has seen on task completion. overall its a great learning experience working with Owens Corning.
good,"I would still be working here if it was not so hot in the summer. There is no air conditioning at Owens Corning, and that does not mix well when working with fiberglass insulation."
good,"Overall, I enjoyed my time at Owens Corning.  The people and experience allowed me to learn and grow tremendously, both personally and professionally."
good,"- I joined Owens Corning in a difficult market situation as the product was transiting to commodity stage and economical situation was getting tough day by day."
good,There is always a lot going on. I learned a lot about upper management. My co-workers were friendly and playful. The hardest part of the job was laid back culture mixed with the high productivity environment. The most enjoyable part was the fast pace.
good,"fun place to work if you along with the people"
good,The management that I work for is excellent. It is a joy to work for my project lead and am sorry that I couldn't find a permanent position through Owens Corning. I do not regret my time working for Owens Corning through Bartech.  My contract is up soon so I am moving on with respect and new friends.
good,"The workday would start out with talking with the guy on the shift to get an update of what s needed currently and what s coming up and needed for a color change later if any. If there were no color change, then I would run materials for the upcoming run the next day while making sure that the current production materials were maintained. I would have to take inventory and sometimes order materials for my manager. That's what I had to learn and to be accurate with my  daily inventory count . Management was ok. My co-workers were a bit to relaxed working on the third shift if you know what I mean. But the best part of this job was my supervisor was my friend and we still keep in touch to this very day."
good,"Wonderful company. The benefits are amazing, the people are great and the products are ""green""!"
good,"Stayed whole night at the month end for clearances."
good,Good experience and good people and environment! As well as compensation. Also the trades that I know tied in with what I was doing. Just a great all American place to work!
good,"This company is a good one to work for mainly because of the union and the power it has in the grand scheme. The work is simple and mind numbing because for the most part, you are looking at machines do the work. That is why I say it is easy money. You get paid really well for what it is they are actually asking you to do. There are days where you will work really hard, but for the most part, the hardest thing about this job is dealing with the people and management."
good,Nice place to work. My skill set is very high and I was very bored. Employees very nice and the company works hard to ensure employees are taken care of.
good,the job required more than was the pay.The constant asking of production when the stock was not available was not fair to the employee
good,"Typical day was challenging in a good way"
good,Gained a Lot of good experience in Sales and Customer Service. Enjoyed being taught by the regional manager. Had good interactions with customers.
good,Certified SAP Solution Consultant SCM– Procurement with SAP ERP 2005; Application Consultant- Logistics Execution & Warehouse Management with SAP ERP 6.0 EHP4.
good,"Company will purchase systems and not fully implement them, leaving the engineering and maintenance department to figure out how it works. This means time needed to maintain equipment is spent getting it to function"
good,Owens Corning was a great place of employment however the bonus and commission program was constantly changing not allowing employees to reach goals due to the fact that regulations were constantly changing
good,if i could i would retire with them and not worry about my future. Was extremely excited to go in and work even on grave yards. They hire family oriented and care about the employees and their day to day life.
good,Management and HR department seem to be lost as to what they are doing. The plant has not yet been in operation for a full year so things are still very hectic and operating poorly. Creates a lot of waste but it's slowly getting better. Given time I think this will be a great place to work in the future once the bugs have been worked out and management figures out what's going on.
good,Owens Corning is a good place to work except for the rotating schedule of 1 month of days and 1 month of nights. You get paid very well at Owens Corning but the health insurance is not that good.
good,Always ran a skeleton crew in maintenance dept. Be prepared to work overtime and 70 hour weeks are not uncommon. Good pay is the best thing about the place.
good,Con variantes en el sistema de producción adas de muxha papeleria
good,"Starts which a shift huddle on safety and any possible safety hazards,also updates on near miss, Quality is part of the huddle. Production updates are the 3rd part of the huddle."
good,"Owens Corning is a great company to work for, there 401k plan is very generous. The culture is very employee focused."
good,"I actually liked working for this company, i must say i would go back."
good,Not a very good place to work and no room for advancement unless you move to another region
good,A typical day is the one at which i entered into the industry as a fresher
good,"we made metal studs from col roll, it was a fun place to work for"
good,Buena capacitacion... El trabajo es estresante por maquinas que siempre estan en constante restablecimiento...
good,"It was a good job ,lots of great people to work with unfortunately they just layed everyone off ,so job security wasn't there, i gave them 16 years & was layed off for 3 of the 16, then last month they just walked all employees to the conference room and told us they where shutting down indefinitely, an didn't even give us a severance package."
good,"The work at this company was not bad at all. Everything was pretty easy and straight forward. The only drawback is the lack of fixing things when machines broke. Everything was only temporarily patched to keep things running. It didn’t make sense since that caused things to not run good. On a positive note, the workers there are trustworthy and hard working."
good,"The pay and benefits are ok, but the 24/7 work schedule is hard on a person with a family and kids. You have to use vacation time for graduations, birthdays, anniversaries and any other special occasion and even sick days like the flu. We cant plan to get sick on a day off. If you call in its a point against you. If your spouse or kids get sick you have to call in and take a point or use your vacation time which your supervisor has to approve."
good,Traveling every week across the northeast was fun. Staying at a hotel  and meeting new people and you would usually work alongside somebody and chances are it would be a friend...but when winter came along or it entered a slow season...mall shows were what we hosted and nobody was really interested and it was boring. Also its not the job to have if you have a family because you could be gone for days at a time. It was fun when i was single and had no kids but times change and i needed job security
good,"I loved it.  It was fast-paced, exciting, ever-changing.  I met a lot of nice people that I'm still in contact with.  I would love to go back but there are no openings in my area."
good,"Long hours, most management are good, there was a lack of communication with plant and Human Resources.  Everything seems to be top secret.  Hardest part of job was rotating from nights and days.  Miss a lot of family time."
good,I worked at OC for 20 years and held many different positions.  Very good company for a change agent as it was fast-paced and ever changing.  The company has a large international footprint making it a tremendous vehicle for world travel and the experiences that brings.
good,"Owens Corning believes in core values"
good,Coworkers are great. Can get real busy and fast paced. A lot of responsibility especially in the asphalt plant. No two days are the same. The company pays well.
good,"With an aging S&T population, and traditionally lean organization, this company is changing as new blood is coming into the workforce.  There are limited routes to career advancement in S&T.  At the top levels, conservative business approach is still valued."
good,Hard dirty work. Good co workers. Very busy all of the time. Manufactured a very good product to be proud of. Good to all of the employees. Good pay and benefits.
good,This is a manufacturing company-who treats its employees well. It is a safety conscious company and puts employees first. They treated me extremely well.
good,It's a great place to work for when you have the right management in place. The company is built on 7 core values and it should stick those values and not allow any one individual change them.
good,Great place to work if you don’t have high ambitions for advancement. It does pay a lot better than a lot of the other plants in the area. They do have a couple descent managers but most of them are still wet behind the ears and have no clue as to how this plant should operate. They keep doing the same thing expecting different results. When they do come up with something new it's thought up in a meeting room and they do not get any input from the workers on the floor. Needles to say most of the hair brain ideas they concoct are a complete waste of money. The plant manager is joke and fake as heck. You rarely see him and when you do he’s wanting to take away from the ones who do all the work on the floor so he can get a larger bonus. You only see the 2 safety managers when someone gets hurt. They should at least come on the floor every once and a while.  As far as the workers on the floor some are ok but the larger majority are lazy as heck and cry when they have to do actual work. The rumors run ramped and everyone is in your business. But if you can see past that it’s ok. lol
good,"Co-workers are honest and hard working.Learnt a lot on design,manufacturing of composite materials and Structural analysis."
good,"Maintaining budgets for engineers, conducting inventory, creating and maintaining spreadsheets. Using all aspects of my computer skills."
good,"Una pena que decidieran irse a China"
good,Excellent company culture.  The business was very strong and had excellent support from Leadership and The Board of Directors.
good,"I last worked here 35 years ago, so I do not remember to much.  I remember the heat, it was summer, and the flakes of fiberglas floating down like snow.  But it payed the bills."
good,Buscar alternativas melhores e mais economicas para custos de prováveis futuros produtos.
good,"load shingles onto trucks and unload raw materials,operate machinery"
good,"A top notch, very successful organization. A place where an employee's talents are appreciated."
good,"Despite some drawbacks like favoritism (which exists everywhere, to some extend), in my opinion, OC is OK as a place to work. There are ups and downs with production schedule. Salaried employees have more reliable schedule than production. Usually, there is lots of overtime for all production employees. Usually, because sometimes production will work 3 or 4 days per week. There are also layoffs. Usually at the end of the year (low demand for roofing shingles). Sometimes for two weeks, sometimes for 2 months at the time. So there is no stability of any kind or job security if you are production employee; your schedule can change rapidly. 4 day week, or 7 day work week can be had in the same year. Terrible news for anybody who has small kids and needs some kind of reliable/stable schedule. Management does not seem to care for this or any other problems workers may have (and there are plenty); as everywhere in manufacturing, numbers on the spread sheet are always first priority. "
good,"OC does a lot of great talent recruiting and development.  Executive leadership seems to be short sited and focusing too much on quarterly goals, leading to silly decisions.  Around 2013-2014 ""Growth"" was the mantra, but in 2019 it seemed to switch to cut costs to cover up prior poor decisions.  Unfortunately I believe this will hurt the company and its employees over the next few years."
good,Overall good company be prepared to work 10 to 12 hour shifts. Good friendly environment with the employees A diverse company Management and employees great teamwork a monks each other
good,Great company and job experience. People are great and great mentorship capabilities. Development programs are a great benefit to learning. Management.
good,"While at Owens, I trained in several areas of the plant. I started as a fiberglass inspector/packer.Then learned the chemical binder room. "
good,"The day start early in the morning (7 am), the operations team is around the clock so te decision making is fast pace and there is no much room for analyzing, procedures and tool are archaic so that have to be exchange by time and manual rework, long journeys and there is no accuracy on the measure systems."
good,"First production job, was not thrilled with the days on days off 6 week days 6 weeks night rotation or the management style but learned a lot and feel that my skill base benefited from the experience"
good,"Enjoyed my time at Owens Corning. Company was concerned about the welfare of its employees. They provided on site health facility and brought in health care specialist to inform its employee on current health related issues."
good,Great company to work for if you are looking for a career other then a job.  O.C. has allow me to gain lots of knowledge and meet lots of great people throughout the company.
good,Owens Corning is a great job if you go there and do your job and stay away from the gossip and nonsense. But for the most part the pay is great and the work isnt hard at all...its a union job and you advance through seniority with the opportunity to make more money
good,Owens Corning continually seeks to improve the process and is always working in the right direction.  The Operations staff does very well with being proactive and taking care of the equipment.
good,"Uma boa empresa para se trabalhar, falta apenas alguns ajustes de planejamento de produção."
good,"A typical day was a challenge to meet sales quotas, but enjoyable chatting with shoppers in big box store.  I interfaced with hundreds of people each day & like the challenge of gaining their interest quickly. My attitude had to be up-beat to draw their attention & keep it.  "
good,"12 hours shifts on rotating schedules, basically from sun up to sun down, the air is hot and moist, with no fresh circulating air. the management staff are rude and inconsiderate and offer no true value of what is to be performed. basically they throw you on the line, with minimal training and expect you to run the machines without fail."
good,"Owens corning is a good company to work for. You need to always be there ready to work long hours daily plus weekend, a day or two sometimes. Management could improve, hardest part of the job is balancing your daily life. You will be there almost all the time. Pay is decent, co workers are supportive."
good,"I don't know how they stay in business, but can honestly say work is steady. Lots of good hard working people, but poor management. Its an OSHA nightmare however."
good,"Love everything about the job except the pay. No benefits, No raise, Learn a lot about basement construction. Meet a lot of good people."
good,"Ok place to work, some good people, but advancement is time based not skill based so it leads to incompetent leadership."
good,It was a fun and young environment while I was there.  The culture was fast paced and exciting.  It was a fun and good place to be for me at that point in my life.  No regrets.
good,"Good place to work, good pay. Unfortunately work load very much relies on housing market. Something to keep in mind."
good,"The company was a good one; however, the OEM division that I worked for had upper management issues."
good,"I led a group of 4 people to neighborhoods to set up sales appointments for basement finishing. We knocked door to door all day long and I was successful at it. I was the manager in the field and reported to a supervisor the next morning. The hardest part of the job was all the walking and long hours, but i enjoyed working with my people and interacting with the public."
good,"built a girls bathroom for me. got along pretty well with every one. would put up with some idiotic behavior at times.Doctor pulled me off job for that company due to panic attacks ,stress and harassment ( continuous) by certain individuals diagnosis "" post traumatic stress syndrome"""
good,"bom relacionamneto entre os colegas,direção sempre disposta a ajudar,o problema são os horários turno fixo 6x2."
good,I retired from there after 37 years of service. The last 10 years or so management changed a lot and they kept downsizing employees.
good,"Management expects production but has you painting/cleaning while running. Not able to watch machines during this time. "
good,I like working the job I was hired for. I think it is a really great job for a young person he can earn a great living there. and learn many different operations
good,"Very positive work environment."
good,Hard work long hours and strict management great money but no life out side of work paid time off and good benefits. Good way to save money. Will work weekends here.
good,"An industry leader focused on positioning its employees for success.  It did become a bit overwhelming when a 3 state territory turned to a 7 state territory with no additional compensation, which is why I left."
good,"Work could be seasonal. "
good,The jobs at Owens Corning are very demanding and time was a precious commodity. The people were not well trained and turn over was high when I first was brought on board but I can honestly say that when I moved on the environment was 180 degrees different. It had become a very good place to work and the people had changed dramatically. Good place to work
good,I have a multitude of different job assignments. This company was very good at Cross training their employees so that they could fit in any department.
good,Not for everyone. Work in hot environment. Can be itchy hot and hot beads of glass pop on you if not careful. Very good benefits and pay.
good,Nice Work Place new Experience to be learn' And everybody get a long nicely.Long 12 hr Shifts But time goes By fast. So its ok and the pay is Great.
good,"Did Purchasing and accounts payable audit American Express credit card, purchased supplies for factory."
good,"Buen nivel de productividad."
good,"asphalt production / tank loading via railcars. good for those whom need little or no supervision on rail head."
good,owens corning was a great company to work for. paid for schooling to advance in new job field. no micro managing.
good,On a typical day we work hard and laugh hard. I have learned that in the work place you have different attitudes and you need to know how to deal with them all. The best part of my job is when I learn something new.
good,Typical work day is twelve hours. Co-workers were very helpful and friendly. I learned how to take apart machines and put them back together and record data on an hourly basis. The hardest part was dealing with the fiberglass. The most enjoyable  part of the job was the team environment.
good,this company was all about safety for it employes was a great work place like my supervisor work right along side him with the maintenance tech
good,This was a good company to work for very much into safety. learned a lot about safety in the work place. like my supervisor worked right along with him on projects.
good,It's really very good Experienced with this company. working atmosphere and Culture is really very impressive in this company.
good,e muito boa empresa tem seus valores e tambem seus contras tem promoção dão oportunidade de crecimento mas tem que melhorar em outras partes
good,Good place to work if you don’t have a family. Has great benefits. Works you to death. Long days and no recognition.  Promotes from within by seniority so hard to advance
good,A typical day was constant interaction with numerous departments to meet the needs of the company.   I've learned negotiating skills ensuring the best price/relationships for the needs of the company.  The workplace culture is diverse.  The most enjoyable part of the job was interaction with vendors/ co-workers.
good,Great place to work. Started in the entry level department and was feeling great until 3-4 years later where it is now becoming impossible to get out of this role.
good,"Good company overall with a competitive culture. Unfortunately, worked for a division that was sold off and quality employees were let go. Would have liked to see things end differently during my tenure."
good,"Overall it was a great place to work, however, the plant manager created a very toxic environment for most salaried employees.  Berated and swore at me on a regular basis.  I loved my job and did everything to keep the plant operational including nights and weekends as needed.  He gave me no choice but to give up my job of 28 years or take a job I did not want."
good,"Slow to move on investments, spends what is needed most of the time, mostly autonomous in plants, can be political, upper level leadership pretty consistent"
good,"the company takes care of employees and cares about their health and welfare."
good,Great pay and plenty of opportunities for advancement within the company. Set shifts and lots of overtime every week.  Seniority rules with this company they value that alot.
good,12 Hour swing shift work.  I learned a lot about what it means to be a leader in a union shop.  My direct management has been great and they provide great leadership skills that I have adapted.  the hardest part of my job is that I am currently working straight nights and miss out on a lot of family functions.  The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing my employees succeed and develop.
good,"Empresa agradável, com bons profissionais e remuneração compatível com o mercado."
good,"I took orders via phone, email & fax, entered them into the system, scheduled trucking ensuring the truck would be full prior to leaving, customer service and all duties assigned. it was very fast paced & I was among the top call takers in my area."
good,good pay but had a tough time with work life managements.  Long hours but a lot of days off.  Holiday pay was good and descent benefits.  If they were not relocating I would not be leaving this company.
good,Pretty good place to work ! Need to have consistency in the production plans . Products are best in quality and services and very efficient . Management is very effective
good,nothing further to add. good benefits with a few flaws within management and work schedule. not much of a training program for new hires. above average pay.
good,En general empresa que fomenta los valores personales y se desarrolla una cultura de seguridad en el trabajo.
good,"Steady pace work with time to learn. Line production of orders placed by customers. Employees for the most part worked well together and with management. There was at times room for advancement. I enjoyed working for the company. I was able to use some of my previous skills (ie..concentration in steady line production, ability to observe quality of product being shipped to customer, steady 50-70# weight lifting, company showed appreciation to employees by having pizza day, company cooked steak for all employees, company xmas parties, matching 401K amounts, on hot days cold water, popsiclles, extra break. I enjoyed my job for the most part.,"
good,This company offers the opportunity to work within an experienced technical team and to innovate in the building materials area. Managers go through a multi-year grooming process before they step into management roles. People are easy to get along with and enjoy their work. That site includes paths that are beautiful to stroll on when one needs a break from work.
good,"Really enjoyed my 10 years with this company.  Worked with great people, and made great friends.  Nothing but good memories with this company."
good,"A empresa é ótima para trabalhar. Oferece bons salários e benefícios, mesmo que boa parte deles tenham sido conquistados pelo sindicato. Restaurante razoável. Transporte de qualidade. Ambiente de trabalho legal."
good,"Great working conditions. Manufactured equipment for all regional Owens Corning. Our team would build the equipment,test,prove operation, install and run the equipment on site and on time. Great group of guys to work with. It was the best job I ever had but it did not last because upper management cut our department and 5 years of work up in smoke."
good,"some jobs can be difficult at times but the overall culture is good.  Lots of experienced people to work with, and lots of potential for overtime and growth"
good,Working at Owens Corning was new to me because it was my first employment in the manufacturing industry. I quickly matriculated through advancement opportunities and gained an position overseeing the parts department.
good,"I would perform physical inventory and submit purchase request for BOM and daily functional equipment. Review contracts and participate in the involvement of plant inprovements."
good,Great! Place to work if you don't mind physical work like I do. Love my co-workers and shift supervisor. Benefits and pay were wonderful. I would had only changed the swing shifts because that can be hard on families.
good,"Good company in so-so location. Good people. A bit stuck in old ways of doing business. The company finally has a growth vision, but still feels a bit like it's weathering the storm day after day."
good,llego a mi ara  y  checo mis  documento a  inicio de cada turno preparo mi herramienta  y  checo  area entro ami junta de  apertura de cada turno para ver  como vamos en producción calidad y seguridad y  empiezo mis actividades   checo mi  producción del dia y   empiezo a  operar las maquina  ami cargo  y si algo esta mal aviso ami jefe la parte  mas dificil en cuando llega las  auditorias  por que  tiene uno que  estar  al pendiente de  dos cosas el compañerismo que  avía en la empresa
good,"Resilient global manufacturing company in volatile markets. Strong IT team with very accessible CIO. But relative low investment in IT year over year, so teams are lean and progress is slower than it could be. Still very relationship oriented culture, which also stymies progress and innovation at times."
good,"Good place to work"
good,The company is an excellent corporation. However local management seems to be vastly underqualified. There are a collection of good people who simply work hard to get the job done. But poor management allows the work load to remain unbalanced and the results is cronic inconsistency.
good,"There was no ping pong table. Work there 41 years mostly shift work, there were fun times and bad times. There were cut backs and lay offs. Lot of friends ship that have come and gone. Friends that have pass away and of course the new people that come in your life. The hardest part of the job was doing the same thing over every day.We had a lot of change over in management. It bad when you are older than management, when you use to be the youngest. The best part about the job was the people, the people you work with and the other people, the truck drivers,guests, worker families and all the other people that came into the plant.You learn to do what it takes to get the job done. Yes 41 years, you have a lot of memories to think about."
good,Friendly co-workers. Low employee turn around. Small group but never working alone.
good,"This is a great company for the mobile individual to see their career grow.  If you aren't bound by any geographical location, the opportunity to work in different business units seems effortless and endless.  You are given a chance to hone your skills and learn more about yourself."
good,"no tempo que estou na empresa adquiri muita experiencia,na area de atuação,tambem participei e participo de programas internos,como TPM,5S,mas estou a procura de novos desafios na carrreira."
good,"A good organization to learn about the new things in field of manufacturing & production facility. Provides important training to the me about the projects, minitab, kaizen, PPAP, kanban etc."

good,"Great place to work, I like everything wild working in cultured stone Owens Corning it was in a great commuting location from were I was living at that time good pay rate."
good,"Reestablecer maquinaria "
good,I had planned on retiring from Owen's Corning. The advancement opportunities and compensation were great. Joplin plant is still new so they are experiencing some growing pains that are to be expected.
good,This job is for the most part a relaxed atmosphere. Most days this is a pretty routine job as long as you do what you are supposed to. The team environment makes it easy to things running smoothly.
good,The plant is a 24/7 manufacturing operation.  the typical day can vary dramatically based off of what has happened during the past 24 hours.  If the previous 24 hours have been smooth operations than the focus is on longer-term projects.
good,Owens Corning has great top management that trickles down to middle managers. The different divisions within the company allows for different area of growth.
good,"Enjoyed working at Owens Corning. Excellent benefits, plenty of overtime opportunities. Fair management. Friendly environment. Excellent safety culture."
good,"Bachelor's degree is required to advance"
good,"Fast pace environment, learned TPM, 5S, Six Sigma and KRONOS"
good,worked as a casual employee from june to sept of 2010. I liked the job and the benefits and 401k. By the time I felt my body had adjusted to the rotating swing shift me and 30 others were laid off . Very few jobs I worked offered overtime as much as they did which was a plus. The 401k was good but unfortunately I had to withdraw what I saved because I was laid off. thank god for unemployment. What I didn't like was the fact that we had some lazy people there. the permanent full time workers would disappear at times and stop working hard when a temporary worker showed up because we were always trying to prove ourselves so we could be full time.The management also played favorites. they thought some of the laziest worthless people were good and worked the mess out of the good workers who chose to work overtime. they also tried to put us against each other and let the female workers get away with a lot more.
good,This place was great to work for great enviroment always making sure there workers are safe also had great ideas and had papers explaining the job and what you needed for the specific job duties.
good,"salario"
good,"I if you are self-motivated, can handle change and stress, multiple roles and long days, Owens Corning is a great place to grow. "
good,During the housing boom era this was a great company to work for. The pay was amazing and the opportunity for advancement where everywhere. However the housing market is not as it was back in 2004 so i cant say how the company is at this time.
good,"Good living wage job. Unfortunately, Owens Corning decided not to continue having a distribution warehouse in the Northwest. It was a very good fit for me and will be a hard job to replace."
good,Great Company with hard working employees who work well with management as a team. Hardest part about the job was that the plant was hot during the summer and cold during the winter.  The most enjoyable part about the job was that the people at all levels were enjoyable to work with.
good,"OCF is a very large, global corporation with tremendous success worldwide.  Having worked there for 30 years, starting as summer-help and advancing through the ranks to plant manager at 20 years, it provided a successful career."
good,"Management was fantastic to work for.. The environment was tough but manageable. benefits were good for the time, never worried about job security until talks of a bad automotive year."
good,"I worked on all things electrical from incoming power for the entire plant to circuit board level components. "
good,Typical day started with a check of the night before and a review of orders due. Walking the was a daily task talking with employees. Any safety issues were discussed and corrected
good,"I would recommend working for Owens Corning to almost anyone. It is a good environment with plenty of visibility to leadership if that is what you like. "
good,"Days consisted of load to be filled. Work was assigned by time and due date in which crew handled. In the beginning ( 1984 ) loading was done by hand, now it all done by clamps. Most crew members were there a substantial amount of time, so we all worked together."
good,Great initiative to stay current with the modern manufacturing method involving lean principles.  Affinity groups show a concern for diversity.  Excellent incentive programs for both salary and hourly workforce.
good,"Fun work place. I wish senior leadership would talk to new employees and see how things are going.  Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company."
good,"Prepara-lo vê sua qualidade embalar,ótimo ambiente de trabalho com amigos,calor e coceira devido a vibra de vidro perfuração empresa se preocupa com o funcionário bom salario beneficio e promoções."
good,"Coming straight from the military, this was a perfect fit for what I wanted to do. I had a passion for prep and detail work as well as home improvement. This was the perfect job to introduce me to such work."

good,Empresa con estabilidad laboral y calidad en puesto de trabajo
good,"Working as shift leader, as well as maintenance of department.manpower handling, wip handling."
good,"Our plant closed in 2007. It was a sad day. Accident free employees looking out for each other. Won many awards Plant of the Year, best Safety record and all the community awards. Great place to work many friends. To sum it up for ya all.......wages ok, USA benefits, excellent Team members and finally the plant manager was honest, polite and kept his word until it all ended. Id work for that guy again in any business."
good,"Great culture! The people are easy to work with and the culture is accepting of changes. Business is very ""up and down"" and affected by housing starts. The job is a good one and works closly with the operations manager and continuous improvement department."
good,"I worked in two different departments at Owens Corning. I was first hired into the Residential Roofing Division as the Property Accountant. I learned the computer systems, worked well with my peers, and worked well with plant and corporate personnel to determine how to account for the plant assets. I also performed property asset audits at the manufacturing facilities. The job required travel which was difficult at times. However, I also enjoyed being at the different manufacturing facilities to better understand my job and I enjoyed meeting the people I worked with."
good,"Acting as a Regional Planner for Finished Goods material in North America, managed working capital targets, and improve inventory quality."
good,"Owens Corning is the world leader of building and equipment insulation. The IS functions are centralized in the world headquarters of Toledo, OH. The company pays very well and the benefits are real good. As long as manufacturing is weak OC will be struggling to stay afloat. When manufacturing comes back, OC will be a super place to be employed."
good,Good Place to Work. Benefits are pretty good. Cares about advancement and developing skills. Who your boss is makes a big different in quality of life.

good,"Het is een Amerikaans bedrijf en dat merk je. Veiligheid is een hot item binnen het bedrijf . Het is een bedrijf waar je moet kunnen werken vanwege het glasvlies wat er gemaakt word."
good,"It was a decent job although I feel they could've had better management, better communication, more communication with employees and less hard work.But other than that the job isn't too bad if you don't working 12 hour shifts ( 7 to 7 )"
good,"•	Entered product recipes using Allen-Bradley HMI panels and calibrated PLC controlled pneumatic machinery to ensure all specifications are met before packed fiberglass insulation products are shipped."
good,I would love to work for owens corning still I'm hoping I can transfer to the one here. Owens corning takes care of their employees very well. There is proper training for every position.

good,I was in charge of counting materials and shipping and receiving products and email count to corporate office for review my count to keep everything accurate

good,"This company is making glass fibers , and working 24 hr ."
good,"I really liked my boss and co-workers, although the commute to and from Columbus was horribly long.  The job was a bit boring and tedious at times, but that was largely due to the fact that I was extremely overqualified for it.  There were intellectually stimulating aspects to the job that I enjoyed."
good,I loved working there it provided for me and my family you will have the best insurance. You will work with some amazing people the overtime is always available you will spend more time there then you do at home. It takes a while for you to advance because its based off sonority.
good,"En mi estancia en la empresa, estuve muy agusto con mi puesto y con todos mis logros, con todo lo que aprendí y con los pocos amigos que logre hacer, la parte más dificil de ese trabajo fue, tal vez, cuando firme mi renuncia, un día típico de trabajo pues en realidad se convertía en solo unas cuantas horas, ya que debido a la carga de trabajo el turno pasaba muy rápido."
good,It was a place to learn new things on regular basis. There were opportunities for advansment. Good poele to work with. I liked that you could work in different departments week to week.
good,Responsible for loading and unloading flatbed trucks with roofing products. Also responsible for dispatching deliveries
good,"good working place to have experience in all fields."

Then inspected our pallets to be shipped to customers. I learned to work with a variety of tools. Management was great! Our team leaders up, to the plant leader, were informative and always willing to help and answer any questions. The plant's emphasis on safety is impressive. They truly listened and acted on our concerns. They also considered, even requested, our suggestions. Our team leaders have even helped us pack. I enjoyed my co-workers.

good,"I started with the company as an temp, answering phones for customer service.  Was hired permanently in 9 months and worked in customer service for another year.  Made a lateral move to Logistics and was a transportation specialist for another year.  I then interviewed and was hired as an inside sales rep for the Mechanical and Industrial group.  Was promoted to outside rep, or Area Sales Manager in 6 months.  Took a while to break out of the call center.  Interviewed 6 times, but once I did, great upward mobility.  The company treats it's employees with such a high level of respect.  Work life balance was fairly decent considering it was an outside role.  Have a few complaints, but the positives greatly outweigh them.  Middle management turnover seemed high in my sales role as I had 3 bosses in 1 year, but seemed isolated to my region.  As a hole, I was in 4 departments in 5 years and had 11 supervisors.  Interview process was sometimes long and drawn out.  Seemed sometimes this was for the benefit of management and hr training, which is understandable, and may be complace in large corporations for all I know.  I am really reaching for negatives though, since overall it was largely a positive experience."
