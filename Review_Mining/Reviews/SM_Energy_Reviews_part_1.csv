rating,review
bad,SM Energy is an oil and gas company that develops oil and gas properties. Good at technically developing fields and exploiting resources for maximum value.
bad,"The first 10+ years were great with this company. As leadership changed and the company grew, it became a non desirable place to be, getting worse each year. Poor management."
bad,"The Production Superintendent over the Midland area is a vindictive, hateful, insecure man.  If you're not part of his click, you have no chance of advancement.  "
bad,"I'm glad I'm no longer there. Management is totally unethical.  Current CEO said there would be no layoffs, and after layoffs began he gave himself a hefty raise in pay."
good,"Poorly ran,  upper management spent more money on things that were not needed instead of paying the guys that were good what they deserved! Lots of young engineers that have never been in the feild!"
good,Its an ok job. To much of the goodole boy system. Micro management company
good,"Like most smaller E&P companies in this economy, there's a stronger chance for layoffs/bankruptcies.  To sum things up, poor management, good compensation, and a unsure view of their future (internally and externally)."
good,"I have not had a good experience working here, I had managers who didn't have my back when problems between other employees. Ideas don't seem always wanted."
good,"My position at SM is a new adventure on a daily basis in my job title. Unfortunately, my job is not secure with this company, and advancement at my level is very difficult. The corporate culture has changed significantly over the past two years, it is not an employee driven company anymore."
good,"Work hard and play hard"
good,"Was a really good company under old management, under new management not so much. If you're not a favorite, there is no chance of advancing, It seems as though the harder you work the less chance you have of being promoted."
good,"This position paid well and my manager was amazing, but it was difficult to create meaningful work relationships, as contract workers were not invited to company gatherings.  You always felt like an outsider."
good,Over all a great place to work plenty of paid time off lease operators work a 7 on 7 off schedule.  A great place to learn Lease operating because the set up is so simple.
good,"I was contract employee when the market turned, I would have stayed if I felt secure in my employment. Unfortunately did not want to offer me a raise after two years of work with out me threatening to leave but at that point my mind was made up and I left."
good,Great company to work for until the slow down in the oil industry. Could have used more than one person when it was booming but I got by. The supervisor who hired me passed away and with the downturn in oil the company started to sell off all North Dakota assets and are ramping up in Texas. This has been really demoralizing to the North Dakota staff.
good,he lies no good cheap lier who will cut your legs outs from under you what else could you need to know management was terrible workers where great hours are long
good,"I enjoyed the individuals I worked with.  Communication could have been better with managment.  I worked long hours but enjoyed the time at work.  They would like me to relocate, but it is not an option with two girls in high school, I will not move them."
good,"I love my job."
good,Co-workers and team environment was superior.  Organizational structure could us improvement.  Little Opportunities for advancement
good,"Great workplace culture, Facilitative Leadership and talented pool of coworkers.  The ability to perform your role while receiving the needed support from management."
good,"I was there for almost a year and never got hired on. The waiting was driving me nuts. Otherwise, the teams were pretty good. Easy to follow procedures and workflows. Great training as well."
good,"Events year-round for team building. They offer great learning opportunities. Benefits are amazing, especially for families. Company works well to include families."
good,"Management was out of touch with their employees and allowed the culture to decline."
good,The most enjoyable part of my job was to work on the cost recovery audit.  .  Last year along I discovered and collected $569K of company overpayment.
good,"The whole atmosphere changed once Tony Best retired. New management did not care about employees and was not about the company nor did he make the best decisions.I enjoyed working there the first couple of years. I was so greatful. After the  lay off and changes in structure moral was so bad, people were miserable and many left."
good,Enjoyed my experience  with them. Excellent and timely pay. Very professional and courteous. Would come back if needed hopefully  they will be re-expanding after the turn down.
good,Great People and overall enjoyed the experience. I started an experience that would not have been possible in most places or careers. Right place at the right time. Productive and fun workplace. Plenty of chances to advance and learn new skills.
good,"Travelled way to much of my time but loved every office and the people were friendly, happy and productive. Good compensation programs but rigid HR restrictions kept me from keeping the job when I really loved it. Travel was 60% and covered 6 area offices for support.  When in Houston was required to sit in an office space with a 60-90 minute commute just to say I was there.  Never saw my family. Could have TC'd but they wouldn't make allowances for this. "
good,"I like working here very much. We have a great team: everybody is friendly, ready to jump in and help when needed. have a great boss who is very knowledgeable and understanding."
good,"Probably still a good company, considering what there is to choose from.  The company is less people-oriented than it used to be, due to current management.  Rewards go to the top, it seems.  But, it has good insurance, a bonus in good years, encouragement from management to grow & improve, and concern for the community.  With the downturn in the industry, employees have been asked to do more and more, which makes it a less enjoyable to work there.  At the end, I didn't feel comfortable taking my vacation because it would put a burden on someone else. But it is a place of integrity, I believe."
good,SM treats their employees great. Management is well trained and the benefit package that is offered to each employees would be considered a Cadillac plan by some.
good,Some of the best people I could have asked to meet! Very fun atmosphere and professional co-workers. The turn over rate for employees is higher than other companies i've worked for. I really enjoyed working for this company and with my team.
good,"Enjoyable place to work.  Good compensation.  Good benefits. Great people and good work, life balance.  Great team environment and great collaboration with other teams in other departments."
good,"I worked from 6:30am to 4:30pm with every other Friday off, I enjoyed my job and am very thankful for all of the training I received working at SM. They paid for my college and the benefits were great. I enjoyed my co-workers and the whole office environment."
good,"Loved my group, the Completions group was very professional and fun to work with.  The management team was awesome and had a great group of people working for the company at the time."
good,"The people are great and driven by benefits. I was more interested in development. This is not to say that there is not an opportunity for growth. And internal hire and promotion is available. Overall, SM is a great company. I was not a good match for them."
good,Sm Energy is a great company to work for and values its employees.  they offer competitive benefits and allows advancement of careers.  The company is on firm standing.
good,"Good company, was here only a short time due to waiting for an another opportunity to open up at a future company learned a few things about plunger systems"
good,Had a great atmosphere to work in. The guys I worked with were very helpful and knew a lot about the industry. The benefits were the best I have ever seen.
good,"Great place to work. Great team and family minded company.  Challenges are always work on as a team, managment is easy to talk to when you have a suggestion or a concern."
good,"A typical work day for me involves maintaining dashboards and workbooks on Tableau Server, returning emails and helping staff members with their IT needs."
good,"Great benefits and group of coworkers.  Your happiness very much depends on what group you are in and whether the industry is in a boom or bust market.  When times are good, they are great.  When they are bad, it can be nerve wracking and full of constant change"
good,"SM Energy is a great company to work for, they offer great pay, bonuses and great benefits.  They give you opportunities for training and advancements."

good,"â€¢	Coordinate response and assist local authorities and federal agents in ensuring safety and accountability for area and employees by tracking data.; Dispatch police officers or federal officials and emergency management personnel to call for service"
good,Iâ€™ve worked for estimate a G for eight years as a production lead operator. And I would say It was a great experience and learning opportunity they had so much training for different field of production and we were trained in schools at no cost to us everything was paid by at SM Energy. SM energy has been the best place that Iâ€™ve ever worked for. And if they were hiring right now I would be more than glad to join their family again.
good,"Would track gas measurement analysis for accuracy - was able to recoup over $1 million for the company in this position by checking accuracy of gas measurement, meter tests, gas analysis, and payment documentation.  Worked with outside operators to be sure gas balancing was correct and that any issues were resolved."
