rating,review
bad,You will work long hours and there is zero opportunity to transition to another role if you’re seeking growth. Expect a 6 day work without compensation for extra hours. New business unit leader is horribly lazy.
bad,"-Constant changes in leadership/direction"
bad,"Working at Nature's Bounty is a slave job. The workers are nasty, self absorbed, most don't speak english, you get yelled at for the simplest things and the company is unorganized."
bad,"Nature’s Bounty is a great brand but Management is flawed. When there is a 1st time manager who doesn’t yet know how to manage it can be difficult for the direct reports. There is also a lot of “my way or the highway” in terms of work. Also, the sales team can be very needy and expect you to do their work. "
bad,"They treat you like slave. The employee can not use the same door as management. We have to use the back door. It was an humiliating experience for me. The plan is now close. I work at site 1111, Deerfield Beach Florida."
bad,"Not a equal opportunity work place, you can have more experience and leadership skill, Then a other associate that is friends with the manager they will get the promotion"
bad,Company is always changing and dose not care to listen to the ideas about its hard working employees and the yearly raise does not reflect the hard work done which is told by management until raise time comes around cause any company waste that occurs throughout the year is blamed on the workers which affects the raise. If management worked closer to the workers and listened to the issues needed to be addressed a comradery could be established so that small problems would not become major issues and cost the company thousands which could be distributed to the workers .
bad,Company will be closing soon find something stable hire and fire company hires disabled people in order to get government credit managers barely have any education and are under the influence most of the time
bad,This company is a revolving door. They treat you terribly until you want to leave and then hire a new person to chew up and spit out. STAY AWAY! Terrible work life balance.
bad,"poor management making poor decisions. lots of stress for a job that has no room for growth. company keeps changing, but not for better. managers keep asking for more production, when they never see what's going on and to see where the issues are."
bad,in  my years at nbty I learned a lot I can run a line set up the line and also take lead of that line. my co workers respected  me when I was lead.. shift change over was very hard had to get ready for my own shift
bad,"I worked at NBTY as the employee tells you no body tells you "
bad,"ok to work to much demanding, no work intructions for jobs, supervisors are not profetional. to talk to people."
bad,There is no future working for this company. The IT management here has no idea.
bad,"Working here when i first started was weird. I got greeted by a loud, annoying supervisor. I was told that i had to watch my back and belongings becuase people there are very scrupulous. They make the temps work way harder than perms, its not as clean and sanitary as they make it seem. NO ONE I REPEAT NO ONE washes their hands before going onto the production floor. They just put on the hair nets and gloves and call it a day. "
bad,"No raises, no future.  No life. Mandatory overtime crazy. No respect for employees. If leads in bad mood they take it out unprofessionally on you. I never had complaints any past job working life. Here they complain bout baby stuff but dont care bout actual job related work stuff to be productive."
bad,"I have worked for this company for over 5 years in a clerical role.  I've seen 3 CEOs come and go, each one worse than the next in terms of assocoate treatment..  They tell you in Town Hall meetings that they care about your health and wellness, then you are intimidated by your direct manager into not using your paid time off.  Recently, people you worked with for years are just disappearing - their positions are ""eliminated"" and you are stuck with double work.  The good people disappear and the bad ones are somehow still in positions of power.  At this point, morale is non-existant.  Management in the United Kingdom is completely out of touch with what happens in New York.  No one is ever promoted - they just get ""let go"" if they ask for raises or promotions.  I truly used to love this job and the people I worked with.  Now I can't wait to find another position so I don't have to be subjected to this kind of over-worked and under-paid abuse anymore."
bad,Not a good place to work. Management is very poor. They tell you lies and false promises. They have a lot of temp people. They tell temp people they going to make them permanent and they don't. They like to use people. Many people have quit. Management has bad communication with its employees. They have had many great people work there but they end up leaving for better jobs. If you have experience this is not the place for you. There is much better out there.
bad,Benefits are fake the worse place to work managers don’t care about nobody “keep Looking”.Theres Not really nothing to talk about really bad place to work
bad,Boca building 901 has some good hourly associates. But very poor upper Management and HR. If you’re not friends with someone in one of those positions you might be in trouble. It’s not enough if you do your job at a high level.
bad,"The managers micro manage every little thing. If you slouch in your chair they will call you into the office and write you up. Managers are clueless, don’t know how to keep employees happy. No advancement, horrendous pay for the amount you’re asked to deal with. You start at sales, if you do good they teach you customer support, then e-support. You don’t get compensated for doing extra work even though old employees just do sales and get same pay."
bad,This place has a lot of favoritism and you have to kiss butt to get anywhere. Management is always in a meeting and out numbers employees 3/1. You get points taken away for almost anything and the wage is super low. You can go to USA Parkway and make 5 $ more an hour.
bad,"Management plays a huge role in an associate not being able to balance work and home.  Very stressful and demanding.  Limited resources for the associates to do the task at hand.  Outdated equipment with difficulty retaining parts.  "
bad,"There is no culture, Poor Management. Management don't know anything. Lack of knowledge about FDA and regulations. They not getting good workers. management people are very less knowledge about the business. Its hard to develop something new.No fun because they have no culture. They just make samples and sell it. If they know you are good they don't want you over there. They want you leave."
bad,"I used to love working here. I worked in multiple departments and multiple positions. HOWEVER, management changed over the last few years, and now it is absolutely horrible.  "
bad,"I would elect to decline comment, other than initially my employment with Natures Bounty started out promising and filled with anticipation on my part. As I became more familiar with Sr. Management and the practices that were fostered within, it was apparent that there was a culture of nepotism and favoritism."
bad,"Environment totally changed w/ management changes. Very cutthroat. Lots of unstabilty and people that are underhanded thrive. There are a few good people left, but overall not a nice place to work anymore."
bad,"The company culture is not up to the same standards as other companies.  You get a very racist vibe in the office. You notice that all the minorities are in one section and 90% of them are temps or consultants. The only chance for advancement depends on how much brown nosing you want to do. The management does not look out for their workers AT ALL. They don't even plow and salt the roads when there is bad snow. "
bad,"first they lie when you get interviewed telling you its a 5 day work week but once you hit the floor they tell you is monday through saturday, and if you need saturday off you cant use any of your time available. "
bad,managment engages and promotes inter company relationships and turn blind eye to infractions by speacial employees. some people are ok but very few. most of senior associates are wrapped up in there little world of courting other associates that work is pass around to the newest associates
bad,This company seemed to promote ineffective employees to management positions. There seemed to be a lack of leadership as well as lack of direction.
bad,This is a company with a lot of potential but due to unfit senior Mgt the company has gone downhill for some time. Unlikely that the brands will get back to their old glory anytime soon with current leadership team.
bad,"***** Warning: do not work here *****"
bad,The company operates in silos with complete disregard for other departments. Department goals do not contribute to the overall benefit of the company. Management is hypocritical and shallow minded.
bad,Stresfull. Just certain people got pushed to work while the rest of the people watch doing nothing like they don't get paid and the supervisor approved it. Hpo high-performance operation meaning that you get to do everything and everyone 4 the same paid.
bad,Great working environment.  The employees are highly motivated and the company is poised for growth.  I have thoroughly enjoyed working with the employees and have found the job to be very interesting.
bad,You were constantly watched by management. The managers office was out in the production area and you were constantly watched and told about every little thing.
bad,"All the work there is pretty easy to handle. You just gotta know how to add. My advice to whoever would like to work here is if you're a female, LGBTQ related, or even a temporary associate, these men in this warehouse will make you feel uncomfortable at your own workplace. And management won't do anything about the problem. Not even corporate."
bad,Lot of envy between co-workers make your day at work unhappy. Management knows about bad employees and are scared of taking control. Some people don't follow procedures and hide errors between lead and personnel. Management prefer to be blind.
bad,"Unfair when it comes to promotion. Favoritism is obvious.  Does not train properly. Very poor documentation.  "
bad,NBTY is in a freefall during the past year. Anyone who can get another job has left or gotten laid off. The Company is owned by Carlyle Group (money managers) who are desperately cutting payroll at any expense to compensate for lower sales. The entire IT shop is now outsourced to Indian Companies. US IT employees are treated poorly and being replaced by Indian Companies to save money. IT Management team is in crisis mode as they try to keep things from unravelling further. Senior Management hide in their offices and pretend everything is going great.
bad,"The company used to be a great place to work however with the recent change in management, the culture has changed and job security is none existent now."
bad,start off team meeting with supervisor what we need to do that night then do my checklist on my forklift fix problems if any. Ask shift before us if any problems if so try to fix problems then get to work.put up finished product.my co workers were respectful and kind.the hardest part of my job dealing with management.most enjoyable part of my job was the people good to work with.
bad,Being bi-lingual in Spanish was not a condition of employment when first hired.
bad,"Management was a joke. Refused to teach anything...the favored employee was a young female that was rude and obnoxious and excelled anyway because she was "" hot""---management was running around with their you know what in their hand.."
bad,Management changes led to departure of my manager and other coworkers; eventually I left the company as well.  Work environment was chaotic due to office layout.
bad,Company increases production demand substantially while taking away many incentives and decreasing yearly raises down to 25 cents on average. High stress and high demand environment
bad,"NBTY was a great company to work for a few years ago. It was full of optimism, creativity and growth. Typical day was productive and efficient. It is best suited for recent graduates or entry level positions looking to get your feet wet. It now has become top heavy by made up CO positions and they keep trying to reinvent the wheel making all parts of the company work less efficiently and productively. I truly did love this company and was happy to go there. Now myself and coworkers dread each day that goes by and the company continues to drag us down. There is so much speculation that the company is going to be sold and slowly the brands are breaking down. Who knows what the future holds for this company but as of right now it is incredibly unstable. I wish there was better outlook but I have yet to see a positive change."
bad,"NBTY used to have a great work-life balance, friendly environment, great knowledgeable people. It has changed ever since the Carlyle acquisition"
bad,"THE MAIN MACHINE used to make all the product is about 40 years old and highly undependable(Goes down for hours) and they use this as leverage to make seem like they always need to “catch up” even while working 6DAY work week. leadership has 0 perception on associates lack of work- life balance. Team leaders are only here to pass down information & approve days off. There’s also tons of heavy Rumors about the people In front office having affairs with each other which makes townhall meetings weird. This place has"
bad,lots of vitamins and protein shakes for free good people to work with hours suck overtime in beginning of shift if you start at 6 maybe come in at 4 or 5 am to cover shift. bosses look the other way instead of addressing problems still use temp workers. Waste lots of product daily. ceo  to big to talk to workers.
bad,"Management is not concerned with the balance of work time and family time.  They preach a high performance organization, but do not listen to employee"
bad,I was doing the work of everyone else plus all the Spanish speaking customers were given to me as well. Asked for a .25 raise & was denied. Very unappreciated
bad,Upper management micromanaged too often. Rules don't apply to everyone. So many broken promises. What is said in the interview doesn't mean anything. Rethink your ethics before working here.
bad,I am one of many people asked to sign a document that prevents me from saying what I really feel... so it is best to say nothing at all.
bad,great place to work in. the company got shut down due too competition. fun and friendly environment. met a lot of long time friends
bad,The job is a good one. Its not hard and the people that work here are really decent for the most part. 
bad,"I worked at NBTY for 2 years and during my time there the company went through a corporate restructure. All upper management was replaced including CEO, VP, CMO. During the restructure the department I was in was consolidated and as a result I was laid off along with other co-workers. When I started with the company the Trade Marketing was newly created and I enjoyed the people I worked with. However, I am trying to get back into buying or category/product management."
bad,This job required many hard duties. I had to shift and operate pharmaceutical gel machines and put them in their correct positions. I had to do much multi-tasking and also help my fellow workers.
bad,Good company. No overtime. A lot of extras. No experience necessary
bad,Need to focus on employees well being as much as customer well being. Stop micromanaging the employees and fix the real issues that can help the employees better help the customer.
bad,"Was a great job 10 years ago"
bad,"If you like constant scrutiny then this is the place for you. In the call center is always a dead end position, a spike in the wheel. Constant reviews of calls and always up selling. I hated the grind."
bad,"Poor leadership"
bad,My Company is very cut throat. Outsourcing has become the norm. There is no  job safety day to day. The moral is so low no one in my department wants to be there. People are leaving every day.  Too many company changes at once.  Poor company performance has impacted the employees.
bad,Overall the engineering and maintenance group was sound and helpful. It seemed to me that at times operations was trying to circumvent or shortcut some FDA regulations.
bad,"State of flux. Uncertainty, Lack of communication, favoritism. The company needs to get their act together and unite as one unit. Lack of resources and no processes in place.."
bad,I was here briefly for a summer a few years back. The program recruited top talent and provided a wide variety of resources to foster early career growth.
bad,Coordination and planning with production planners to achieve maximum production goals. Acceptance of the input from all workers to improve the moral and achieve goals set by management.
bad,"terrible place to work with, they do not respect their employees, people with more seniority in there are scared of getting fired because supposly they make more money"
bad,"Nice company.  A little behind the times in terms of programs and business development, but they were trying to catch up.  Hire too many temps so they never could have a good reliable staff.  The management is a bunch of kids who have good intentions, but dont know how to execute a plan."
bad,its not the environment  to worry about no a days in industries its the people that make the work place toxic and unsatisfying which brings down one moral and not want to work efficient as they could if they were happy to be there and around one another
bad,"Focused on driving sales in key retailers and channels with emphasis on new product launches. Work cross-functionally with trade, customer marketing, and sales to develop programs that are specific to customers and provide return on investment"
good,"I have worked here for over 10 years.  There have been so many leasdership changes over the last few years, we are so top heavy and don't have the support in the departments to reach our numbers. We have gone through a massive outsourcing initiative and we are unstable."
good,"Management  they are all about themselves and own personal benefit and gain, if you kiss there rear you may be successful."
good,If you are stuck in the wrong group than your experience might not be a good one.  Overall company as a whole has great people- the corporate culture of the organization is are underpaid.
good,"Very exciting place to work,employees are very generous,but one area of concern,is the lack of training of employees in weak performance of management skills,could use some help."
good,"Before NBTY, Inc, bought the Leiner Corporation, the company was a really relaxed, easy going place to work and it was run quite efficiently.  As soon as the buyout occurred, all systems and personnel were put under undo stress and lacked the enjoyable environment it once had."
good,my day consisted of checking forming lot numbers check the employees for proper ppe. from froming to the production line checking the length height weight of the product made for that day or shift then packaging check if the wrapper is sealing properly and expiration.
good,"Organize daily schedule and team duties "
good,"Nbty is a good company except the Ester-c plant in Prescott Az. I worked there for two yrs within those two years I experienced a lot of cons about this place. The management is terrible and even talks about the workers behind their backs, base their work demands on one persons abilities not all workers. Not very much support from management and will complain about what you do off the clock"
good,"Current issues with front office management. Human Resource manger on-site is not engaged with hourly team members or it's leaders. Do not expect 40 hours, expect to work 60 plus hours with no incentive or comp time in return. 2019 has seen a huge turn-over in staffing from hourly to leadership. Currently no work-life balance."
good,"This job itself is simple but the priority is the quantity over the actual quality. Morale is so low that 0% is being nice. So many changes have occurred that it has caused everyone who treated each other as family to now ""every man for themselves"" attitude. The associates working here for many years are unappreciated and there are positions that are under paid with some departments under staffed with open positions for more then a year. The company benefits is the main reason many are still here for so long since 401K is offered and paid time off ( sick, vacation,personal) of course everything has their limits but it is offered. Also health insurance is available. For the benefits many are still here because it is hard to find a job that offers these options but many associates come to work their hours required and punch out on the dot unlike before the time clock was never a finish line that everyone would race to at the end of their shift."
good,"Management sucks don't listen or do anything if there is a snow day and ur late they give u a point in the point system they have going.  Workplace culture every one keeps to themselves because management holds anything u say against u, and they don't try to fix any problems with day to day activities u just keep going day in day out having the same problems every day very dirty lunchroom, and bathrooms, everyone gets sick all the time overtime in the beginning of the shift u come in at 6am overtime maybe 4 am. If you're looking for a good management team then go else where.  HR rep is only for the company, they waste product all the time bosses are full of B.S. they have drug test."
good,Enjoyable coworkers with unresponsive management and no hopes for the future. Expect to be overworked and under compensated if you have a good work ethic.
good,"The first shift employees barely do any work, the second shift employees have to do the majority of the work. Temporary workers have no benefits compared to permanent employess"
good,"After the sale of one of their main buildings there is no sure thing there. people are giving added responsablities without any promotion or pay raise. Not so bad except some of them are forced into managemnet roles, but kept as regular workers. "
good,"A company that is top heavy in the management sector, and with roo much downward pressures on the Supervisors. The atmosphere is one that allows for too much involvement for all and sundry to make decisions on things that are important for the smooth running of the company"
good,"No rules are followed, favoritism and family runs that place. No opportunity for in house advancement unless you know someone who is higher up in the company who can vouch."
good,"a typical day at work was preparing the materials for the machines to make vitamins, getting all the empty totes staging them in the warehouse.  I learned how to drive a standup lift.  management was ok. Didn't work with co-workers, in my department I worked alone. The job was not hard is was pretty simple."
good,"The division called Puritan's Pride is a mess. The new president of the division is beyond arrogant - anyone can throw money into a marketing department and see sales go up. He brings nothing to that division but can out talk people so they are impressed. He gives  people promotions even if they aren't deserving to make sure they don't go to work for the competition. The stuff  behind the scenes are mind boggling. No one is happy. If people did not need the jobs to pay their house payments.....The merchandising president in the division is laughed about - he knows nothing about marketing and less about merchandising. He's just been here so long no one questions him. The girls who work for him all complain that he is inappropriate and want to go to HR to report him. Then he gives them a promotion and they shut up for a while. This same person bad mouths the other women who work there. He makes a fool out of the web manager and calls her curse words and talks about how overweight the email manager is. WHO IS THIS GUY AND WHY DO THEY KEEP HIM. The stories we hear are shocking. Even tho I've had a chance to go work at that office, I would never. The rumors are sickening. I wish that part of the company would just go away. I've been listening for all these years. I try to tell people what we all hear but they tell me to MYOB. So I will, but it still stinks!!"
good,I loved working for this company however the Management made working here very difficult      It was not what you knew rather than who you knew   Management was not honest and forthright with workers and more or less looked out for themselves rather than the people that made them shine
good,"People there are very kind and sometimes don't mind helping when you ask. When we had a meeting for why we couldn't get a certain percentage a coworker told me not to waste my time because the supervisors don't really listen, Which later on was true. it started getting really busy once Costco hit and so overtime was inevitable even got to the point where you'd work on weekends, which isn't a bad thing but usually it had to do with walking up earlier in the morning. Anyway this job isn't too bad. Not sure how much has changed since I've left so take my words with a grain of salt."
good,"Job was just ok or below average. Poor safety procedures. Management cut a lot of corners probably to try and save a little bit of money on paper. This company was cheap and stuck in a lot of "" old ways "". I wish they will change. GOD bless us."
good,"It is a nice place to work with and it is diverse place where you learn from different people around the work, but it is not an organize place because it needs to improve in training, structure and HR."
good,"I have no comment at this time about the company. "
good,There is no room for advancement within this company. There is also no job security. Fellow associates are helpful and always willing to help one another.
good,"I had a great experience working with NBTY and will never say anything negative about them. I enjoyed the people i worked with and the job itself. However, there is very little room for advantavment. "
good,"Just show up for work on time and don't question management,that's the key to job security here. Don't try to innovate or use your own initiative...the supervisors will think that you're trying to take their jobs."
good,Management there was like a dictatorship. The higher ups were constantly trying to change rules and didn’t care about the employees. Management treats employees like they’re expendable and not working in a career field.
good,NBTY was a wellness company that I worked for dedicated to its employees. After we have Management changes many things changed within the company and the workplace had some downsizing.
good,"They produce Nature's Bounty, Sundown, Puritan's Pride, Holland & Barrett & Vitamin World vitamins. Nature's Bounty is #1 in the mainstream vitamin markets. They are diverse across all segments of the nutrition industry, from manufacturing, to retail sales to on-line branded marketing. Unfortunately their branded marketing department has a very young inexperienced staff, that miss the mark on new product launches the constantly fail. Their upper management rarely listen to field sales regarding new products, sales strategies or distribution tactics."
good,"Company morals and benefits are great but they hire leaders in the wrong place for all the wrong reasons. Alot of hours worked throughout the week. Some weekends needed especially during month end, quarter end, & holiday season."
good,"Nature's Bounty was bought by a private equity company back in 2010 and has struggled ever since. Virtually no growth while the pieces of the company have been hacked off and sold (e.g. Holland & Barrett, Puritan's Pride). They have gone through three CEOs  since the purchase and Nature's Bounty has kind of treaded water ever since. If you are looking for a company that's growing rapidly and is an exciting place to work, then Nature's Bounty is not the place for you. They treat the employees pretty well however. Free turkeys at Christmas and other perks throughout the year. The base compensation is competitive but the bonuses are weak. One major downside is the location. Ronkonkoma is in the middle of nowhere. There are very few good places to eat for lunch and there is no employee cafeteria where food is served."
good,"I have had 4 different people to report to in just 7 years that I have worked at NBTY, many managers are coming and after one or two years were gone. So in long term those changes are not good for the system. Overall I had a very good experience at NBTY because I was in charge of many projects in many facilities at NBTY."
good,"Friendly team and safety is number one at work, I learned a lot of thing and improve my job, safety and well-ordered workplace with friendly managers and all associates."
good,I really dont have much to say at this time.  IFor the most part I enjoyed my time working at the company.  There are pros and cons working for all companies.
good,"It used to be a decent place to work, but I am not sure at this time, as the company was sold since I left. I know that people who I worked with are trying to leave."
good,Enjoyed working as a three man team. The hardest part of the job is continuously monitoring equipment throughout day with minimal downtime. Enjoyable part of the job was making improvments.
good,"An innovative vitamin company that is trying to change the status quo of how the consumer takes vitamins, views vitamins and changes the way they eat protein bars/snacks and how they view them. My job was to make design collateral in the form of flyers, POP material etc. to help our vitamins and protein bars/snacks stand out from other companies in this area."
good,Good company including job benefits to work for but a lot of favoritism with management overall not fair.
good,I learned how to set up & operate several kinds of machines.Work consisted of a lot of heavy lifting .I met & associated with meany different cultures.
good,It is a temporary job in a factory environment. The usual very repetitive work each day. I routinely poured product into hoppers or helped extract product from machines.
good,"Most everyone was friendly, I wasn't there long enough to provide a good assessment and it was quite a while ago. I did see a lot of collaborative teamwork."
good,"PE-owned firms will have a particular/expected atmosphere.  "
good,"Training is very limited, is up to you to learn about new process. Forecast accuracy is horrible and you are always struggling to meet requirement. Co-workers are extremely lazy and leave early on a daily basis, as a result upper management takes away their responsibilities and assigns them to you."
good,"It's a good place to work except, if you work better than everyone else, you will be taking advantage of. There are no supervision or management on whos working harder and better. Everyone is let to do whatever they want to. There no consistency in good work practices. It feels like everyone is there to collect a check and leave."
good,"Still a good company to work for; however, when it was privately (family-owned) it was a much better place to work. Annual picnic and holiday promotions (fruit baskets, meat, free turkeys at Thanksgiving)."
good,"The Nature's Bounty Co. is a great place to work.  Because the company is owned by a private equity company, there are lots of challenges to meet financial targets.  Overall, I enjoyed working there."
good,"Good place to work, benefits are good. People are approachable and room for growth and advancement. Going through changes within company when I was there and taken over by another company."
good,Thanks to the team for all their support. OPEX and lean manufacturing. Behavior based development and subject matter technical skills build for hourly associate improvement.
good,"The associate culture changed from feeling like a family, people happy to work, support the business and do their best for the company; to departments ""trimmed down"" by business intervention, management changes, and plant closings.  Moral went along with the changes."
good,Too many misaligned practices.The culture preaches to be the best but the practiced culture is to make numbers. Associates are not compensated by their effort.
good,Being a production line lead is a very challenging and rewarding position in a fast paced environment only problem is some of the management section give too much stress to there employees.
good,Nature's Bounty is a good place to work.  The work life balance is very manageable.  The company is in a great industry.  The culture is good and the people in the company are knowledgeable about their function.
good,NBTY is a decent place to work.  Depending on what department or location you work in. Some are better than others. There is some nepotism and huge turnover rate.
good,back breaking work lifting heavy boxes of pills and loading them into a feeder machine. I didn't learn too much except how pills are sorted into bottles and packed for shiping
good,Management changes direction often which may pose a challenge for those that prefer a routine type of job. Work load may vary depending on individual goals and targets.
good,"Always busy people are very friendly. I have learned how to work as a team. Hardest part of the job is not making friends. We Distribute Vitamins world wide, feels good been a part of a company that provides health products."
good,Interesting changing directions day to day productive  management change  co workers are the best part of working at NBTY.
good,overall company was good i was in a temp position so they would lay off every few moths and then call back did like as much because it wasn't stable.
good,Lab work is extensive.  The company has limitted growth opportunities and leadership is focused on the bottom line. Fun place to work considering the lab is always very busy.  I enjoyed working with everyone and admired people dedication.
good,"there was a very little fun, its hard, faster, it was not a good team to work, it was an uncomfortable place to work..some times we had to do things faster than normal."
good,"Great benefits, great associates, and a great product portfolio. The company tries its best to be generous with employees without going over the top bringing entitlement."
good,not a good working environment. Unstable management when I was employed . Also not a very healthy working environment.
good,"A typical day at work is very busy and productive, My Co-Workers are very fun and friendly which makes it for an enjoyable work day. I l gained a lot of warehouse experience in all department of the field"
good,"It was a family run business, recently bought by a financial firm and all new upper management now running things. Not as personable as in earlier years."
good,"As an intern for NBTY I analyzed complex pricing models and structures on a daily basis. I was responsible for maintaining over 30,000 items and reporting daily inventory levels to my manager. This internship allowed me to research objectives for driving revenue, savings, spend, and credibility in the procurement domain."
good,The hardest part of the job is standing up and walking for at least 7 hours a day. Typically I am assigned four production lines and I have to check every line at least twice in my shift. More time is needed when the lines are starting work in the middle of the shift.
good,"Hard charging fast paced atmosphere.  "
good,place was alright people got along but nobody offered to help anybody else in nothing that didn't have to do with their job.  it was like a imprisonment job very strict to the point that they bride you with the overtime or you would not get hired permanent.
good,"NBTY draws upon nature's bounty to cash in on the market for preventive and alternative health care.

Management  seem to care more about deadlines then safety to the point were they wont fix a problem until it becomes an accident. the hardest part of the job is meeting the deadline while taking the directives of management that are hypocritical and against safety guidelines. The enjoyable part of the job are the co-workers, they are hard working and helpful individuals."

good,"NBTY is a solid company with ambitious growth initiatives. There is however an underlying layer of hypocrisy from senior management, that seems to pit the 3 shifts against each other, as opposed to fostering the team spirit. Resistance to change and the implementation of new ideas and processes create a stagnant and stale operation. Outwardly management claims to embrace change, but the reality is that change is not welcome."
good,You wont be bored  working here.  There are great teams and great people.  It is a company that has a lot of room to grow.  You have to network very well to move up.

good,NBTY can be a major shaker in the retail and nutrition world with being recently acquired and placed into a portfolio of companies that may be able to play a large part in shaping what NBTY could be for the new millennial marketplace.  It will take time and the current workforce will need to cross-train to keep up with the digital transformation and re-branding efforts.

A lot of the day is spent preparing samples, standards, extractants, and mobile phases. Troubleshooting instruments and documenting test results in accordance with GMP guidelines is also required of the chemists.  Management demanded a lot but were fair and did not micro-manage employees.  My co-workers are great team players.

good,"I am currently employed at NBTY as a service desk technician. I handle, assess, and escalate requests. NBTY owns Vitamin World in the US along with Holland and Barrett in the UK. The call center deals mostly with the POS aspect of their business but also tends to have the internal aspect of their computer infrastructure. I ensure that the IBM AS/400 databases worked seamlessly with newer technology such as Windows 7 Enterprise. The experience I gained administering large corporate mainframes such as the systems at NBTY is an invaluable part of my ongoing computer training. I also oversaw the integration of newer database technologies from ORACLE, making the transition away from the industry standard AS/400 machines. This transition to ORACLE was a slow and systematic approach to introducing the NBTY infrastructure to cloud based solutions. Even though I saw the advantages of moving to a cloud based database, my time at NBTY taught me to respect the older IBM AS/400 servers. The AS/400 was so robust that it controlled nearly every activity of the corporation, from batch mixers in vitamin plants to petty cash registers in retail stores. "
good,"Very busy, and fast paced environment. a lot of team work, and communication is required. The only thing I had a problem with was that the manager only cared about her shift, didn't really commute with the other 2 shifts."

good,Working at NBTY was challenging.  Every day you will learn something new.  The supervisor and co-workers were very pleasant to work with. A nice environment to work at.

good,"A typical day at work would be fair, co- workers are friends, and which they treat each and everyone like family, we communicate to get the job done easier and quickly in a smooth and organized fashion. I learn to organized, prioritize important products such as batches that has a buyers due date.  sanitizing which means everything has to be clean for the next job or product, cleaning of machines, tools, walls and rails are part of a daily routing work. The hardest part of the job is when all the machines are working, speed are turned up, absent employees which put more burden on another employee, most enjoyable part of the job is when we succeed In completing the goal that was set for the month and also free lunches."
good,a good solid company. average wages and good benefits. Factory work environment. many shifts.

Management is now extremely corporate and are looking for young formally educated professionals that bring in fresh ideas to match the new corporate vision of the company.  Three CEOs in the past 7 years.  Lots of change on a constant basis.  Not much promotion from within unless you have specialized talent, licenses or certifications and/or education that they may be currently searching for and fits with their ideas at this time.  Great products.  Used to be lots of longevity as most persons were working at the company for 10 years or longer.  Now that has changed and there is much more turnover from warehouse to office personnel on a constant basis as the culture of the company has changed dramatically."

good,"There are still things I love about this job, but ever since the company was taken over by yet another investment firm, I'm seeing some changes that make me uncomfortable. There is more of a push for quantity than quality, which is unnerving when quality is my job - I work in the QC department, in the lab. "
good,"Training was provided and updated safety tips."
good,"Natures Bounty is a small business that I very much enjoyed being a part of.

good,"I have worked for this company for many years, including plant closures. The company has always sought to find placement for displaced associates. The organization is meeting-driven, so as a leader, you'll fight for time to practice your function. There are always opportunities to learn and grow. The company eagerly funds educational opportunities if those opportunities benefit you in your career. Management is fairly solid, though you will always find the less adept leaders if you look hard enough. The culture varies by site and is reflective of the leadership within those facilities. The only career limitation that I see is in the corporate ceiling, wherein the upward mobility ends due to limited role availability. Otherwise, this isn't a bad place to be."

good,"Every morning, we have a meeting which prepares us for what we will be doing and alerts us of what is going on in the company. Once that is over, we go to our assigned rooms which we are either going to clean and prepare for blending or start/continue a blend. Once we complete the blend, we clean and prepare the room for the next batch. My co-workers and managers are all terrific. They all have lots of experience in the field and help teach me everything i need to know to excel in this industry. The hardest part of the job is waiting for the next batch. Since the pharmacy must prep it first, it could take hours before we have batches to mix, so we must stay busy until then. When i have nothing to do, time moves too slow for me, so i need work. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with my co-workers and completing a batch. Once it gets approved, it is a terrific feeling knowing that we did the job correct."

good,"The facility that I worked for started out as Nutro Laboratories, a contract manufacturer of vitamins in South Plainfield NJ. The company was purchased in 2000 by Natures Bounty. What I really liked about this purchase was that NBTY retained all of the former Nutro Labs employees. Right from the start, NBTY made sensible changes to our facility, and we prospered. When NBTY was taken over by a investment firm, things started to change. Facilities began to be slated for shut down, including ours. It was a real shame because our facility was prospering."
good,"This company is one of the best places to work at. The job is moderately stressful with a lot of thing to learn. I've learned various raw material products coming from different vendors arounf the globe, as well as the nature of handling them in accordance to the Nature's Bounty standard operating procedure. In terms of managemen, there are tons of policies that they impose to futher meet each and everyone's concerns. As all of us working in an industry with cultural diversity, we cannot alleviate the fact that there are some negativity when it come to others. This is one factor why I'm currently applying for another job. The hardest part of my job is dealing with stubborns, boastful ,and sometimes racist. I'm a type in which i don't discrimminate nor touch the sensitive topic, especially with regards to racism. I love dealing with various race and nationalities. The most enjoyable part of my job is I get to jive with most of my co-workers and perform my duties in an accurate manner."
