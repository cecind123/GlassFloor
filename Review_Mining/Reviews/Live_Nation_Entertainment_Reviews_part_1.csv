rating,review
bad,Great people lots of fun got to see concerts the boss treated people great work as a team enjoyed my environment got to me a lot of different people I was giving task and a timeframe to do them and learn a lot of new stuff
bad,They treat us as adults like we're children while working for themselves couldn't talk. The pay isn't worth it and we're standing the whole time besides breaks and lunch.
bad,"Very dead end kind of position.  Ticket Discounts were ok, but for a job that required you to be professional even outside of the work place the pay was mediocre."
bad,They will use you and for cheap. They care nothing about you or your family. LN is a joke and hope one day they get bought out and all the higher-ups lose their jobs
bad,The managers at the hollywood palladium are absolutely terrible. Theres no pay structure. Supervisor made alot less then ushers in some cases. House manager would take the confiscated drugs for his personal use. Definitely would not recommend workingat this venue.
bad,This is not a place to work. Management doesn't care about their employees what so ever. They don't give you the overtime or the money when you do!!!!
bad,I was sexually harassed by a fellow employee . my supervisor wouldnt give me a bathroom break when i was 7 months pregnant. It was nice to see the concerts while working
bad,"With regard to production, Live Nation is a horrible employer. They will not hire you securely as a full time employee. They won't even hire you as contract. You are an 'as-needed' employee until you work enough hours that your audited labor requires by state law, LN to offer you benefits. This does not mean you are full time, you are still 'as-needed' it only means they are forced in to giving you full time benefits as specified by labor law. This is not a guarantee of hours. Secondly, their pay scale is miles below the average acceptable rate for the jobs they hire people for. They sell the low wage as an introduction wage, or negotiable after the 90 days probation period. They offer  minuscule raises beyond that. Working for this company has been nothing but a disappointment and a real eye opener. They care about the bottom line (money) and have zero regard for their employees that physically put on shows. I have a feeling an executive assistant somewhere within Live Nation would feel differently, though. I bet it's great to sit behind a desk as a LN employee, but for those actually putting on the shows they sell, this job is the worst."
bad,Hated working for. it really sucks when its hot your out in the sun burning up and never can advance in jobs.
bad,"While the restaurant may be good, the SECURITY in the concert Hall is ridiculously Bad!!!! I have seen people smoking pot right in front of me, and I am told to let it go.I have watched people do coke in the bathrooms and had to let it go. I have seen People with Knives clipped to their belts let in.I have seen security personal get jumped with little back up. This is a seriously dangerous place to work at. Let alone see a concert. The guards don't care, it just an easy pay for them. As long as the customers are happy,  House of Blues does not care about their safety or well being. Bartenders are constantly over serving customers. Making the concert Hall a drunk free for all!"
bad,"Not really much to say outside of it being seasonal work. I worked in housekeeping so I was in charge of making sure bathrooms were stocked and the venue was swept clean. Overall, we were never understaffed and work was easy."
bad,"The calls are back to back and can be overwhelming, rude customers and supervisors are never there to help. will never work at a call center again!!!!"
bad,"Ticket takers do security work at the end of their shift by policing guests as they leave the venue. Ticket takes to pick up dangerous trash.Low pay."
bad,company structure is screwed up. You will never advance or make any commission. everyone walks all over each other and treats each other horrible. worst company i have ever worked for.
bad,"I was a ""temporary"" employee but I worked there for 6 years. (I left for a year and came back because I'm dumb.) I got no benefits of any kind. I routinely asked management to train me for a permanent role. I was willing to learn, grow, and do more but no one cared. The structure was pretty chaotic. When I left, my job was posted for twice what I made, as a permanent position with full benefits. I tried hard to make a name for myself but there was no room for advancement. Once you were a ""temp"" you were a temp. The culture was pretty cliquish, everyone wanted to be a cool kid because it's live music. I worked at a venue. There was questionable activity constantly on behalf of our operations staff, who were also ""temporary"" permanent employees. Everything there was shady. I really liked my manager, he was a good dude but I wish he'd done more to change things."
bad,This job requires total dedication. 15 hour days that never end. It was fun and the staff were amazing. It's a very draining and life consuming field.
bad,"Don't do it. The headaches are not worth the money. Plus everyone does whatever they want, no structure whatsoever. Hr is not even in new york state."
bad,I would never work here ever again. The managers are lazy. Some do drugs and the head chef is slow as dirt and has no idea what goes on in the restaurant. They are racist and the way the speak to most of the individuals who work on the line is very unprofessional. The Gm for the restaurant just left because of all the problems as well as several other managers. They can’t keep staff. Only good thing are the benefits and the hr team and a few employees otherwise a complete utter mess
bad,"I think there is a lot of disconnect from corporate to the local office.  It could have been an awesome place to work, but the GM is out of his league."
bad,If you want to grow - this IS NOT the place to be. It is a place where it is about power and not the art. It was one of the best decisions I made deciding to leave. The hardest part of the job was dealing with people who think they know EVERYTHING!
bad,Wish I had never applied for a job there. That is all I have to say.
bad,"3 year with Live Nation has been up and down always asking myself why do i come back to this BS company. they don't care about employees they just go along with anything they hear and ride with. Don't even follow their own company rules. pay is wack, parking is stupid, management has power trips, always trying to be the big dogs wearing black shirts. The people you work with is the only thing that makes the job fun."
bad,"The job gets boring most of the time and time goes by very slowly. There are no breaks so you are just standing in one spot for at least 5 hours. In addition, you had to signup for specific concerts or wanted to work and I was cut off a lot because spots were taken up even though I signed up early."
bad,Working for Live Nation for a show or two to hear good music and make minimum wage is ok but not for anything more than that.  The pay is not on par with the physical labor you will have to put in during some shows and you will have to keep your head on a swivel because staff getting assaulted in not uncommon.  Police are on the property but are kept away to keep the crowds coming back to purchase alcohol and doing other substances.
bad,"As the company does not actually train you or coach you as other jobs do- it’s best to have CSR skills already. Be advised, many colleagues and guests will challenge your happy, effervescent, and positive disposition. Keep up the good work. You may not get recognition, but you will sleep better than them."
bad,Management and corporate positions have a high turn over rate.  Inexperienced HR department.  It appears they look only at numbers and do not care about the well being of it's employees.
bad,"Spent more years than I care to say doing a job I loved. But there was nowhere in the business to go up. They pay scale went down yearly from when Live Nation took over."
bad,"Live Nation is a company that will take as much as you're willing to give, and unless you're in Sponsorship or a Talent buyer, you will be expected to work for a sub market rate in most cases."
bad,"If you are into long hours and no personal life this is the place for you.  Can be rewarding depending on the department you work in.  co-workers are great for the most part, management leaves a lot to be desired, if you like to be a number on a spreadsheet then this place is for you"
bad,"I enjoy working at Live Nation very much, a typical day at work consists of me creating, and finishing ad plans as well as making copies, filing invoices, and contacting radio and television stations. I have learned much about the industry and about some beneficial and not so successful ways to market shows. The hardest part of the job would be working in the same enviornment without being given new or bigger responsibilities. The most enjoyable part of my job would be working shows and see how everybody's hard work comes together."
bad,It’s a job but there is no advancement and no full time opportunity. They make you know you are replaceable  and you end up wasting your time working hard for them
bad,"This job was filled with exciting and interesting tasks. Every day was different, and I am forever thankful for how much I learned while working in this company. However, training never occurred and room for mistakes was intolerable. Making a small error was always a threat to becoming fired. Hours were constantly cut, and there would be weeks where I would not receive a shift. For everything I learned in the music industry, this job was worth it. However, the company needs to desperately review the way their employees are treated."
bad,"Lead by terrible inexperienced management, with no idea on good workplace culture. Lives the high life whilst the rest of the team carries the company underneath. A shocking comparison to the international offices in the US and Europe."
bad,I left in 2005 so I don't know what the company is like now. I think they are too different from when I was there so I don't feel comfortable giving a review.
bad,"Hours are long, over-time is non-existent, company only cares about shareholders."
bad,If you enjoy standing in one stationary spot and having to deal with belligerent drunks in the baking heat for minimum wage and have to hear bad radio tunes played live I would advise you apply to live nation ASAP.
bad,"The leadership at Live Nation Merchandise is sorely lacking. There is no vision or communication and internal teams can feel adversarial. Employees are provided no training, mentoring, or annual feedback."
bad,You're put under a lot of stress to do good. When you don't do good you get put on finals. Also don't look at your phone. Don't touch it. Don't breathe the word phone.
bad,"shifts are hard to get unless you're friends with management, they don't give shifts based on performance or seniority.  i love the work environment overall but shifts are hard to come by."
bad,"I worked a night shift and was never told of changes made during the day shift.  Management has a ""clique"" mentality that singles out and punishes others for the same actions/mistakes while others are ignored.  No consistency"
bad,"Mangement was terrible, did not care about employment growth. Work/Life balance was the worst. Felt I was always working and co-workers weren't really the best or your friends. Everyone talks behind everyones back. Toxic environment. "
bad,"Live Nation is a great company, great benefits but be careful when choosing a group to work for.  Not very family friendly.  Super high expectations for Managers, pretty inflexible on the corporate finance side."
bad,"fun co-workers, helpless managers, a typical day at work is answering phone call, if we run into a problem, we dnt get taught on how to handle it, the managers take the call over, n deals with it, without any suggestions with how to encounter and handle a problem like that again."
bad,"Are you desperate for a Job? Are you willing to be abused and physically harassed by customers? Are willing to over look the security of others just because you might upset a customer? The Wow factor this company has made its motto, makes it almost impossible for Security to do its job. You can be beaten up, punched, spit on etc., but if it makes the customer happy. HOB San Diego IS probably the most dangerous concert venues, I have ever worked!!!! I have seen guards literally over look mace, chains, knives and one time even a screwdriver. The excuse? They were an adult!!  As long as they were not bringing in outside alcohol. SECURITY is a SERIOUS Problem here. Management and leads have no idea what they are DOING!"
bad,"It's not the best place. There's a strong lack of proper communication of information in the company, which is a problem when they fire people because of it. They try to make things 'fun' with special days with raffles and give aways but when it comes to their employees and customers, they don't really care. Any complaints you have get pretty much ignored and if you become too much of a nuisance they find a way to get you fired. Over the phone. It's not hard work, just stressful, 80% of the time it will be customers cussing at you and insulting/demeaning you. The company seems fine at first, but the longer you're there, you start to see that it really is just a big company that doesnt care about anything but money."
bad,"It's difficult to keep the work/personal life balance. They encourage you to take days off, when needed, but most of the time, you'll end up working from home. It's not uncommon, and almost expected, to work remotely while on vacation."
bad,"I was hired based off of my extensive event management experience.  Was asked to be a ticket taker to start out due to no open mgt positions.  Filled for multiple manager roles for duration.  Then came to work and saw they hired two new managers with NO experience.  They asked me to come to work and train them and then go ""take tickets at door"". NO CAREER ADVANCEMENT FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR!"
bad,Like all major Enterprises they can and will discriminate at their convenience.  A lot out of touch management personnel who have positions based on who they know and not what they know.
bad,"have nothing much to say about this job at this time , its just a stepping stone for a good customer service help and quick money place for anything you might need"
bad,Working here is definitely different than any other workplace I've ever worked for. Things are laid back but also a lot of responsibility falls on the workers. You need to be quick on your feet and work fast. your demeanor is very important.
bad,"As an intern, a typical day would be coming into the office and having a list of upcoming shows to create marketing for and making a list of target audiences to reach out to. There will be many changes to be made until it is finally ready to be sent out and printed. Management was very demanding at the time because I was balancing school, another job and this internship. Although it was extremely fast paced and over all really demanding of an intern, I did learn to juggle a lot of projects on my plate, learned how to choose target audiences and where is the best place to market a certain show, and how the entertainment industry really works. "
bad,"this position was a challenge because I was the only ""married with children"" person on the team. There was not alot of wiggle room when family obligations came up."
bad,"I don't really want to spill any tea here because that's not my game.  They're okay to work for, there's some sniveling little trolls and some nice folks and nary the two shall meet."
bad,"I walked away after almost 9 years at a local venue at the first show this season... The current operations manager informed my fiance and the other lot security supervisors they could clock out and go home all because they were waiting to speak with the general manager for the venue about issues that needed to be addressed.  The venue tried this many years ago, and it did not work out well for them then.  "
bad,Corporate changes are a never ending thing and often bad ideas. General mangers come and go and turn over is high. Management constantly threatens employees with write-ups and the pay is very low. When the company faced new taxes during a law change regarding gratuity they took the cheap way out cutting our incomes dramatically.
bad,"Long days because of head counts in venues if you are a manager"
bad,"Management seemed detached from workers, they knew it had high turnover. They forced the good workers to constantly stay at high stress areas while allowing the poor performers to slack off."
bad,Live Nation has amazing benefits such as free concerts and live shows.  Unfortunately there isn't much work/life balance and the shows tend to take over entire nights.
bad,Poor communication & treatment of the staff by the mid level management. I think the atmosphere & the customers are overall easy to deal with. The leadership is the main issue.
bad,"Answering calls from a PC using tools provided, internet access restricted to Ticketmaster.com. Having to persuade customers to purchase tickets for entertainment. A lot of customer service skills learned. Talk to people from Canada and the United States."
bad,"Process 150-200 invoices per day using Captiva, respond to vendor emails, add new vendors into our Oracle system, assist seniors with any projects (refunds, change in coding, researching vendors)"
bad,The benefits at live nation are awesome but don’t apply for any positions in the payroll department. The director as well as the supervisors are incompetent no support no compassion micromanaging as well as favoritism
bad,"My job as a security team member was to ensure the safety of the attendees and other staff at all times during events. I was responsible for assisting guests with finding their seats and facilities as well as maintaining the crowds and  performing wand scans at the front gate. Hardest part of the job is working in the heat or cold for so many hours at a time and only being paid $7.25 per. You get to pick which shows you're available for, so the schedule is pretty flexible."
bad,Bonne ambiance mais aucune considération des salariés et de leur travail
bad,Did not like company culture. Didn't really take advantage of free show because I never wanted to be back at the venue after work. Hard to work for--good for intense people.
good,"Fitting the job into your schedule was random, never definite that you'd be able to stay to work or be sent home due to the event and if it was overstaffed. It was hot and humid some nights and others were cold and wet."
good,This job is fun for the fact that you get to see so many concerts. But I don't or barely know any of the higher ups with this  company. There feels like no real chances to advance and you will definitely get someone who will yell at you for no good reason.
good,"It was a fun Job got to see free concerts which was a perk but some days you would work two days straight  12-14 hours not getting a break until 8-10 hours into your shift getting off at 2-3am then have to be back 6 hours later and redo it again so by the time you get home and shower you get about 3 1/2 hours of sleep and you have to be back for another 12-14 hours. There was no food provided for security only for hospitality which makes zero sense, because they can eat there whole shift because there cooking and serving the food. Meanwhile security is walking the property and on there feet providing the protection of the public and don't get food , respect, or the pay they deserve. Also most but not all management sits on a high horse and talks down to there employees as if they are peons its supposed to be a part time fun job for extra money it was no wonder why so many security members left during shifts are just didn't show up or just never came back."
good,It's an okay place to work. It has its good and bad days. If you can't handle the heat and humidity for long periods of time definitely wouldn't recommend. It can be very stressful at times when working security.
good,"I've worked with live nation since I was 16 but when I started I didn't mind the minimum wage or the late night concerts. But as of these past two seasons, we have just now gotten a 50 cent raise and have been doing jobs that aren't the ones we applied for. This is all while working with supervisors who don't know what they're doing."
good,Exciting to work in a faced paced and fun industry that strives to improve the end user experience and provide amazing musical moments to everyone that enters a venue.
good,Workplace Culture. You learn a lot from their way of uploading to database/sites. Coding is great fun and the possibility of working remotely and often is great.
good,The company gave me no chance to improve and use my skills. They expected you to be on call 24/7 even though that wasn't your job description. Very low pay and very stressful with managers expecting you to be perfect 24/7. I felt like there was no chance to move up.
good,Majority of peole that work at LN are great. Casual dress and benefits are a plus. Work-Life balance is severally lacking. Avg working hours 10 hrs + a day and weekends. LN's outward mission statements do not reflect the corporate culture within the company.
good,"Very entertaining, meet alot of people, not many hours, some managers are great others are very poor even mean. I didn't get a break for 4 hours one show on an 11 hour day. I complained about it to a boss and they told my boss who was the sister of the manager who was not taking care of me. I was given a laundry list of all kinds of made up stuff so she could protect him. I Did Not Like That at all and considered the thing very unprofessional. I was assured I would be taken care of that day and I was not."
good,"Working at LiveNation was a great experience in to event operations, however there was little to no career advancement and management was not entirely supportive of staff."
good,It was a good learning experience for me. I learned quite a bit about sales and marketing during the short time I was there. One perk is you got to see the shows or concert halfway through when you were done working.
good,This is a great company to work with and the staff was nice. It didnt pay the best but the work was fun.
good,"I am currently working for Live Nation Company and commute to two different locations. One is in Concord and Wheatland, which both locations are located in California. A typical day at work is listening to instructed tasks given for the day to be performed at various stations throughout the amphitheater stadium. The tasks performed are cleaning restrooms and stocking before the day of concert. Sweep the plaza, parking lot, and dispose hazard materials. Pressure wash seats, air blow leaves and disposable waste. "
good,"I worked for live nation UK for 3 years and in that time, I was let down many of times by management."
good,"Sadly, if you're looking to advance with this company GOOD LUCK. I had the pleasure of being with this company for years but the only pay raise I ever got was relocating only to find out the raise was due to minimum wage being higher where I ended up."
good,"good place to work very stressful at times. needs work on working as a team.advancement is very rare. live nation has incentives for employees to better help customers, but one sided."
good,Not really something to dive into unless your a young adult. It doesn’t cover bills and it’s just a volunteer type of thing if you enjoy concerts. Summer fun type of gig.
good,Company culture is great but accounting department lacks career advancement and relies on old school traditions. Needs to adapt more with the times and learn that forcing people to sit 8 hours a day at your desk doesnt equate to production.
good,"Flexible hours and your choice to work, but you pay for parking and food, don’t get a lot of breaks, and customers are often disrespectful. Lots of turnover."
good,"The staff is very rude and have favorites, you get assigned your position and stand there for hours at a time without breaks. The only good thing about this job is sometimes watching a great show. I wish employees could've got benefits (free tickets)."
good,"Live Nation has a strong brand and a stable of recognizable talent that is underutilized, however, with the right team in place can become a global force. "
good,There was a clear lack of communication across teams that led to inefficiencies. The most difficult part of the position was managing expectations while delivering the best work possible. Teams were not built out enough to fulfill and surpass expectations of management team.
good,This job is great for a college student who enjoys concerts. Not great if you're seeking advancement or a career. Little to no opportunity to advance and the pay is terrible.
good,"Good for someone who is looking for a second job, the cleaning department was hard work very few breaks long shifts and very underpaid. The only plus to the job is being in a concert environment other then that it’s not that great."
good,It takes a lot out out of a person. Your job soars  from ushering to security with exhausting work and minimum breaks it’s just on earth. The benefits are really only the music and experience. The good part is you never have to worry about exercising you get your work out but the bad is truly all the work.
good,"It's perfect if you're looking for an easy, minimum wage, concert job. The management in my particular department was really nice & easy-going. Other than that, there was no motivation to work hard at your job."
good,So I worked there for about two months and it's supposed to be $10 an hour every two weeks and they don't take out taxes or anything from your check but all of our checks were $60 - $100 we worked from 3pm to 11pm. No management would ever make time to talk to you about your pay or any needs. They were very nonchalant. The only benefit or fun part was being able to witness the concerts if you're working inside.
good,"It is a difficult job, long hours on your feet and the pay is based on how well you do in sales that night and how big of a concert was that night. Not for someone that is looking for a desk job. you are out there interacting and working with people from 12 in the afternoon to sometimes 1 am."
good,"i enjoyed my time working at live nation. I got to see the concerts for free, meet new people and the artist.  I cant wait to work for them next year."
good,You have tons of benefits for working for the company but the work life balance is lacking. You are expected to always be available even on days off with little positive reinforcement.
good,fun work environment.  a lot of work very physical and demanding with a lot of unruly people but you are not paid well at all.  company does not give iokind of compensation.
good,Had a great team of hard working people.  We had long hours and minimum time to sleep but somehow worked through it.  Our pay was minimum. It is a fun place to work for someone who is younger but no possible way of working your way up.
good,Company is very top-heavy with management and it's company culture to have a lot of 'hands in the pot' on sales calls. Hard to navigate the company.
good,"I enjoy working here sometimes, but sometimes it's not so nice. I feel like I am being overlooked in terms of my importance with the company and my overall hard work."
good,"A typical day at work usually begins at five o'clock in the morning when you meet with the production team and receive your rider, which is a list of everything you will be doing for the next eighteen to twenty hours that the artists our under your care."
good,The House of Blues can be a great place to work when it's busy. The customers are pretty decent and it's a very fun environment with a pretty chill staff.
good,This was a huge corporation with little thought to the staff. The staff was separated into have and have nots. They underpaid the security team and did not require the bartenders to tip out as a result they had high turnover ratio in the safety of the venue and bartenders that have never left since the opening of the venue.
good,"It's both a great & bad place to be. Manager's are personable & fun. It's perfect for a college student trying to add a little cash to their pocket books."
good,Definitely a place you can be yourself but its also a job for someone who works fast and hard. There will be blood sweat and tears but you have to keep on pushing through. Its a great job if youd like to be part of something great. After working for a while you start to get hired at other venues and have the opportunity to make high pay.
good,It was a fun environment but it was stressful. It was an unorganized environment because of how much was going on. Hours were very little. Great for those who enjoy concerts and want to make some extra cash.
good,"A quick-paced, customer filled environment. Very productive with reliable supervisors.  Most concerts where sold out, late hours were required to clean the theater after the shows."
good,A typical day at work would be setting up parking lots. The most enjoyable part about the job was being able to listen to the music of the concerts. The hardest part of the job was the late hours.
good,"Working in the entertainment has its up sides, and its down sides."
good,"Only knew local people didn't know any High ups."
good,"Seeking opportunity for growth.  Have been with the company for four years, looking to enhance my managerial skills and gain exposure."
good,It's a decent company to work for. The hours can be lengthy but I work in Finance so that is typical. I do find my position to be stable so that's a positive.  
good,Live Nation has great benefits and the salary is very good in the job position. If you enjoy live music concerts then you will really enjoy working there.
good,I think that if they pay hire and if they give more money at least 10.00 I think that people would love to work there more and if they had more shows to because some people live off that in  the summer time
good,It is a pseudo glam job. It IS outdoor work and has fun aspects. Has SOME advancement potential if that is your path. It is a cool job to say you tried. Get to see some shows (sort of) and get paid for it (sort of.) If it paid decently it would be REALLY cool. BUT you have to like handing out and collecting hundreds of lawn chairs and picking up peoples trash.
good,"I learned to be a good manager and also how to clean a big facility. They do not know how to treat the people who work for them good. I liked it at first then, I had to train my new manager who makes way more than me and I always have to make up for his mistakes."
good,No work/life balance. Very long hours which you aren't really compensated for. I feel they just need to value the entry/midlevel employees more then the turn over rate wouldn't be so high.
good,The Tabernacle in Atlanta is okay to work at. Management and staff are good to work with. The hours are based on how many concert and events are schedules.
good,"When you are told that there is no room for growth in a haste way by your own manager...its time to move on."
good,"I would work between the main office and the 2 venues. "
good,"My whole issue with working for Live nation’s House of Blues was the director all the way down to the supervisors. The director of the music hall didn’t even introduce himself. I didn’t find out who he was until later on in my employment. You get the run around when you are looking for answers to your many of questions because training is non existent, but they swear you are supposed to know how everything works. They have favorites. If you wanted to come to a show they pick the favorites first when it’s supposed to be a random selection. You pay for parking, even when they cut you right after you just clicked in!!! They can eat all day long, but as soon as you eat a piece of popcorn it’s a huge deal. House of blues could really be a nice work place, but the managers make it such a pain to even be there. They are rude, and they do not lead my example. No one is ever on the same page! I really hated to quit, but it was either that or my sanity! I also didn’t like the fact that we had to carry heavy furniture up steep stairs, and outside. For that I feel that pay should have been better. The bar tenders got away with murder. They served people w/o wrist bands, and didn’t stop when they were visibly intoxicated. They got making it a huge problem for us when the guests would become problematic."
good,I liked it ..just wanted a better opportunity so I decided to look for another place to call job live nation as a company is great to work for .although I'm looking for a better opportunity
good,Typically a day would consist of making sure that I was to work on time and that the coolers and shelves were stocked according to what was needed. What I learned was that some customers can be difficult to work with and that I had to be patient with them. The management staff was pretty good with making sure we were doing everything right when it was needed. It was unique because everyone working cared how everyone else was working so everything could be run smoothly. The hardest part of the job was making sure that the coolers were filled and keeping customers happy. The most enjoyable part of the job was the experience.
good,Good company but bad at paying what they owe to their workers.  They still owe me about two paychecks and I haven't been working with them for over a month now.  I am still owed about $400.
good,"It was a great place to work for a music lover.  Co-workers were great.  Hours were hard to get used to.  Could be in a 5AM one morning, the next day I could be there till 3AM"
good,Live Nation provided me with opportunities that I would never have gotten anywhere else. I will forever be grateful for the time I spent with this company.
good,"This is a good place to work if you are fresh out of school and looking for entry-level job in music industry. It is a mostly positive work environment, depending on management."
good,"It is definitely a good start to get into the music industry, but do not expect any hand holding. Only self-starters should apply."
good,Can be rough dealing in security but was an overall good group of coworkers. Lots of drunk people partying. Just do your job and should be a good night.
good,"Pro- Fun place to work would recommend for a side hustle, plus getting to see free concerts is always a bonus."
good,"Culture is fantastic, team is devoted. Compensation depends on region and cost of living, most offers seem fair and manageable. Ability to advance depends on the person."
good,Having this on your resume and being able to attend all of the events makes it all worth your while with the low compensation. Live Nation while having a high demand on caution and crowd control does allow you to enjoy your job while attending events. You learn how to be the best guard you can when you are put to these type of test and standard requirements.
good,"This place is a blast if you can stand on your feet for hours at a time, because apart from smiling and meeting amazing people, that is your job. You stand there and smile, greeting guests, or walking around; you are still on your feet 95% of the day, you're feet will be sore, and your back will hurt but you would've heard some GREAT music and met some amazing people and that is why I LOVE the job and continue to work there during the season."
good,You are concert security. You are there to work and not watch the show. depending on the show will change how busy you are. You will always be able to get a break but it is not going to be for about 2 hours once people start coming in the front door.
good,"During my time in the summer of 2018 at Live Nation Entertainment, I came to the conclusion that it is a great job to have if you don't like being under a routine. Working at concerts and being around the public makes every moment and exciting and completely unpredictable. I would highly recommend this job, especially to teens and young adults."
good,"Working at Jiffy Lube Live was fun, especially if you like going to concerts and connecting with people. Not only do you get to attend the concerts for free (since you're working there), but you get paid for it!"
good,"As a parking attendant at a concert venue, dealing with intoxicated people is a regular thing that gets old quickly. A lot of standing in one place and waving my arm."
good,"They pay too low so I don't work for them."
good,"I enjoyed working with LIVE NATION. However, in the VIP area things get loud and with the amount of people drinking and leaving drunk is absurd.I would Limit the beverages. I myself did not find it fair when working a show, some guests do not always agree with how fast or slow the service is. Ive noticed Guests will Lie to management to get Free things.Example:Drinks/or Even move up closer too the show. "
good,At my time there I had a lot of fun and I've met wonderful people that I can call family but I thought I needed something better and bigger and so I took the opportunity to leave house of blues and search for something that I think is gong to make my life a little not easier and better income wise
good,"I was a Security Guard at Live Nation, ok? I had a blast."
good,When you are working in the entertainment industry the work is long and hard but the perks that come along with it are life time experiences I will never forget.
good,"You can have fun while doing your job. I enjoyed working their and vibing with guests, good music, ok food. Guests weren't rude they enjoyed themselves as well."
good,Got to see alot of artists and hear alot of music from around the world was a great experience had to deal with all sorts of people some crazy some so drunk and out of it we had to carry them out and have the ambulance check them out and sometimes we had to get the cops involved and throw them in the drunk tank some nights were hectic but others were awesome got to meet alot of new people and learn how to deal with them in different ways all in all was a great work experience
good,"Shop and prepping for the shows meals."
good,Working here is fun because of the people you meet but there is a lack of organization. Nobody is really in sync with eachother. The hours were scattered because you only worked when there was shows.
good,Supplemental job mostly done over the summers. Most of the time i was stationed at the Mid Florida Credit Union Amphitheater. I have also worked the Citrus bowl in Orlando for bands such as The Rolling Stones and in St. Pete selling merchandise for the indie car racing.
good,Live Nation is a fun place to work they keep you busy and are very educated on their jobs. Training is fast and easy and you get straight to work. You are provided with all the tools necessary to complete your tasks
good,"fun environment to work in to meet new people and to learn what it takes to put on a show first hand, behind the scenes. i would have to say standing is the hardest part of the job.u have to stay on your feet. you do get breaks."
good,outstanding company to work with. pass out poster and flyer and inform people about upcoming events and shows. sale tickects and passes. the hardest part of the job is standing in the hot summer at an event.
good,"Worked part-time, flexibility with making your schedule.  Attended a variety of concerts at different venues. Intimidating at first but friendly. Great opportunity to meet diverse groups of people."
good,"I am new this season and really can't give a review at this time.  So far, my experience has been good.  I would like to be given more hours to work as this is why I took a second job in the first place."
good,Good company but need  to pay more money to throw  employees in house .... instead of hiring outside companies an needs to be more understanding if you have another job outside of them
good,Long hours kept me busy.  It was a 9-5 work day on regular weeks and 23 hour days on event days.  I managed 20 people on regular days and up too 350 people on event days. the rewarding part was being profitable at the end of the day.
good,Security guard at Alpine Valley. I made sure everyone was behaving properly and worked in a team to help make the environment as safe and secure as possible
good,"Pros: experience, co-workers, location"
good,you put in a more than average work day.  intermingling with different divisions.  management works well with employees
good,"Fun work atmosphere, lacking career development. Great team. Lack of office communication at times."
good,"Many people became complacent and too comfortable with their jobs. Compensation was low compared to other leading technology based, sales/ticketing companies. Salaries in San Francisco are too low to live beyond poverty in San Francisco. The hardest part of the job was getting a raise and advancement. There are plenty of opportunities for advancement but the number of times I saw my teammates get promoted was very seldom. Co-workers are pretty consistent for the most part, however, morale is incredibly low across the company. If your job isn't in tech, you aren't appreciated."
good,"I started out working the front door, to running the place. I learned how to deal with people at their best and worst states. I'm a problem solver, and later became a number cruncher."
good,"OPERATIONS   Manage day-to-day store performances of the store. Overseesales, inventory control, visual merchandising, housekeeping, security, administration and compliance to store policies and procedures. Assisted in two stores concurrently over a four month period with highly successful sale results "
good,"Fun work environment"
good,Working here allowed me to work with different people everyday it showed me to be patient with people
good,If you enjoy working in a very diverse place this company is the best.
good,"Live Nation is a great place to work if you are passionate about music. The work atmosphere is casual, however the work ethic is not. Everyone at Live Nation works hard to make sure all bases are covered."
good,"I had a wonderful group of co-workers, but the work itself was frustrating. The management didn't understand the needs of the consumer and that fell on the heads of the customer service reps. Also, there was benefit to longer employment."
good,It’s a very cool job to work because you get the opportunity to meet people from other countries and you get to listen to different styles of music which I enjoyed.
good,"Live Nation had a very relaxed atmoshphere, maybe because it was more so in the Entertainment spetrum. It didn't have a professional setting although it was in an nice establishment in Hollywood. I worked in the fraud department but the manager lacked interpersonal skills and didn't communicate with any of us about what was expected. We heard she excelled in her position, but wasn't fit to be leading others, and it was obvious during my time there. Several of us had suggested we have atleast weekly meetings to talk about our goals and future expectations, least to say it wasn't fufilled. I would say that was probably was a challenge, not being able to communicate with managment. But for the most part the job itself was consitent with work and freindly collegues."
good,fun and fast pace job love working here great on the teamwork with co workers we worked as a family  to get thur any event there are good day and bad one but we work together to solve them
good,Working with LNE was fast paced and demanding. They provide a stable work environment that presents a fair share of challenges both necessary and self inflicted.
good,"Live Nation is easy but the hours are long and your almost always standing up and dealing with traffic, Management wasn't the greatest, could of been better and they need actual people who are willing to talk and ask for advice rather than yell and be one sided"
good,"you will constantly have work to do so it helps time go by. You typically work two separate 4 hour shifts within a day of work. One shift in the morning for load in, and one shift overnight for load out."
good,The experience is worth it the time. The management is willing to show you how to do the job but there is no room for growth. I was able to take advantage of the tuition reimbursement benefit and I an grateful for that.
good,"A typical day of work consisted of assuring any patron's enjoyment of the evening to the best of our ability."
good,"Im only there one weekend out of a month so I don't the company that well because I am new, but it seems to be a great company since it is worldwide.  The people that I have worked with seems to really enjoy the concerts."
good,"The Orpheum is a great place to work part-time, they provide reasonable wages and great perks, the only trouble is there is no work at all during the summer"
good,"A typical day at work is in a cubefarm facing 2 monitors. The company does keep its work spaces updated. Facilities are great with cafe and gym amenities. The hardest part of the job is navigating all the software changes, and multiple platforms."
good,Get to be in the V.I.P section to meet the bands. Its a very fast pace environment. Good people to work with the environment of the concerts is very different each time I go there.
good,"It was nice. Good members. Good staff."
good,"It is always a pleasure to work for Live Nation. We set up concerts and get an idea of how things function. Good pay, but no benefits as I'm not with union."
good,"My day consist of billing and reviewing contracts. Working with Accounts Rec, Accounts Payable and Vendors"
good,"Load-ins start promptly at 8-9am, punctuality is a must. After initial unloading you will be assigned to a crew and tasked with one aspect of set-up, (lights, sound, set, etc.) Work is quick and often requires no special skills or tools, with the entire load-in taking 4-5 hours before much of the crew is cut. Crew returns when the show is close to over, and reverses and repeats the process to load-out. Load-outs are always overtime if you participated in the load-in."
good,It was very fast faced but a very fun workplace! I was a cashier so I had to manage money and check over the inventory. Overall it was a very different job and I enjoyed it
good,"With Live Nation I would sell merchandise during concerts. The fans at these concerts are usually very demanding so it is important to stay calm even if they aren't. The hours are very long, you have to be there hours before the concerts and stay long after it's over. I learned how to deal with difficult customers. The hardest part of the job is being outside selling t-shirts in 90 degree weather. The best part was being able to go check out the bands during breaks."
good,"Since every event is different, we have a quick meeting to give out details of the event and what is expected of us and find out what role we would have to play to make sure that the clients got everything they needed.  I had a superb supervisor who was always quick to jump in and assist when needed.  He was friendly and kind to everyone but wasn't a pushover.  The most enjoyable part of of the job was the chance to see a variety of events.  One day we could be hosting a ballet and the next a rock concert to an awards show."
good,"Chill management in parking. Work whatever concerts you want, but the typical workday may go into 10 hours. You get a nice break once all cars are parked after show starts."
good,"nice people, relaxed environment, learned a lot from the marketing team at LiveNation as well as from the people around me each day i was there. Everyone was great and very helpful"
good,"A couple of summers ago, I worked at the Xfinity Theater in Hartford, CT.  While working there, I scanned customer's tickets at the gate and greeted them with happiness.  This job requires you to be social and comfortable with lots of face to face interaction."
good,Live Nation is a great company! My only issue is thier processes for on-boarding new employees.  They are not organized because of the frequent turnover
good,"Fun place to work, nice friendly people, not enough hours and pay was somewhat low, but good shows to enjoy while you work, management could be better."
good,"This was a very fun job. You get to hear different cultures of music and people. Schedules were very flexible, anybody was needed in their eyes. Just be aware that this is a seasonal job."
good,Ensure safety of people that attend concerts and events. Worked at outdoor venues during the harsh summer weather which didn't bother me. Had to support co-workers during intense situations and learned ho to use a walkie talkie radio. Most enjoyable part of job was interacting with others.
good,"Exciting company to work for"
good,I like knowing what my role is and where that takes place. I also would prefer working indoors and not having to do overtime that isn’t paid as such. I didn’t mind the managers or the people it was a personal choice to leave the company.
good,"I have worked there 13 years as a seasonal employee. I started as a Security at the entry gates worked my way to Supervisor of Back Stage. Then I became an Usher when the Security company closed. From Usher I am now Supervisor of Fan Ambassadors, a new position."
good,"Good culture concept, but can a be a 75 hour week meat grinder for management as the company tries to save labor. Their resolve is to throw more money at people to convince them to stay with little opportunity for advancement/growth."
good,"Hours can be long and demanding. Work environment is very hectic and stressful at times. Overall, it is a fun job and we try our best to create a fun team."
good,Working with Live Nation allowed me to interact with thousands of people per day. I learned to have a strong work ethic and advanced in my department within my first 2 years.
good,"Fun place to work with great people and culture; however the work is long, unsupported, and has no benefits to provide, so you're working for generally less pay than elsewhere, and no benefits to make up for it. I didn't want to leave, but I had to, under those circumstances."
good,"Fun company to work for, a little disorganized as it relates to training/onboarding etc.  Good if you are looking to get into events/ entertainment field and don't have an immediate need for a higher paying position/ degree."
good,"they hire great crews."
good,"This is a great part time job.  If you like the entertainment industry.  Event Staff conducts screening of guests at entry control points searching for illegal weapons, drugs and alcohol."
good,"good place to work , I love the view, management team is sub par and they only hire women to bartend so there is almost no room for advancement. But its consistant and sometimes fun."
good,"Easy work basically common sense, great atmosphere and excellent manager, great team support. Seasonal work hours are part-time, advancement is based on experience, only con is that the pay rate sucks, other than that everything else is good."
good,Job was based on standing around guiding people to correct locations. its a good job just not always around due to seasons. Hardest part was trying to figure out who was ment to be in which area. tickets should easy to see sections and ect.
good,While working security at live nation I encountered a lot of interesting people. I found it fun but at the same time kind of scary depending on the event and the demographic. The other guards were nice for the most part but definitely interesting. I feel like they could have given us better communication between each other given what we’re dealing with. It was definitely a fun job and I made a lot of memories doing it! I would recommend to a friend.
good,"I had a great time at Live Nation and made a ton of relationships that I will carry for the rest of my life.  Booking a 1500 cap room was challenging and rewarding. I learned a ton of marketing strategies that I will also carry with me. I thought the local management could have been better. I really enjoyed getting to work with bands like M83, 311, Breaking Benjamin, and many many more."
good,I  was going to school there in Tampa and was good job to help me out to supplement my disability and the people was friendly that I worked for and with.
good,"Excelente experiencia, donde en vez de ejecutar al becario se le usa para hacer cosas fluviales"
good,The tasked asked to do are not hard to do. There is a lot of different types of shows at Comerica. I don't work any other venue so I can't speak for them. Live Nation even offers medical to part-time employees
good,"twenty hour workdays with like minded, extremely accomplished coworkers."
good,"Its a fun place to work if your just looking for a little extra pocket change. Might help pay a bill."
good,Ticketmaster is a good company that will do the right things for its employees and customers and has very resilient means of ensuring quality of service for each client and each employee.
good,"Excellent job if you love music, pay is now what it is about since it is very low for what you do. Very young co-workers which is good and bad."
good,"A typical day at work ranged from as little as 8 hours to 15 hours. The different positions I worked at the Gorge helped me learn that I have to be very patient with some people, and definitely respectful but still having to be assertive if needed to. Our managers always checked on their employees, making sure they have had a break, and making sure they were well hydrated. My co-workers also had to be patient and respectful but if problems arose, our manager could always help us out. The hardest part of the job was standing for so long, and having to be patient with people who refused to cooperate. The most enjoyable part of the job was definitely getting to watch shows and watching people have a great time."
good,Freelance work allowed me to continue going to school and work additional jobs on the side.  Easy way to supplement current income. Minimal stress and freedom to choose assignments as convenient.
good,"It is a great place to work to hear concerts and not have to pay for them.  Most of the people are nice, fair, and accommodating.  There are always some people that have different values and ideas than you which make working with them difficult."
good,"Meet lots of fun people, lots of laughs, gets really hot and really cold during the season. The hardest part of the job is dealing with really angered people but other than that it was a really good experience."
good,I worked for Live Nation as a sound monitor for the VooDoo Sound Experience team. This is the team used for the Voodoo Music Festival in New Orleans during Halloween. It was a great experience overall and I learned a lot.
good,"This organization helped me to improve my leadership skills. I advanced from cashier to supervisor, and also completed my internship as the assistant to the HR and Parking Manager. I gained a lot of skills and knowledge working with this organization."
good,"Live Nation as a whole is a great company to work for however that does not translate over to LNE owned, Front Gate Tickets.  This has a toxic work culture, poor / sexist leadership and lack of career advancement."
good,"Worked as a contractor creating an automation framework for their website which was basically a tool for Bitcoin. Great team, but unfortunately, project was cancelled."
good,"on a typical day I Would clock in, receive my walkie and earpiece and be told my position I would be placed around the arena for the day. Head to that area and perform my duties until the show was over. As well as clean up after the show."
good,It’s fun to able to be there for the concerts and shows. Sometimes there can be lack of communication from other employeees or supervisors. Customers would sometimes cause problems.
good,Fun and exciting needs better pay needs more hrs more incentives needs to allow all employees at least get free food and drinks. Better bathroom breaks.
good,"The people are great and really easy to get on with but because it's such a fast-paced environment it can get stressful."
good,"great to see concerts and get paid while doing easy work. at times very boring, but can be rough. have had to fight ff drunks and aggressive people during concerts."
good,"Overall I enjoy my job with the company; unfortunately it is event-based scheduling and few hours per week/month. My co-workers are all great to work with, and I enjoy the environment as well as the flexibility of the schedule system."
good,Work too many days without a day off.  Budget was tight and unable to hire extra help.  Hours were long and wanted to stay open even though business needs didn't warrant it.
good,I enjoyed my job and the people that I worked with. My management was awesome and really understanding. Felt there was close to no room for advancement. I also often felt I wouldn't get as many hours as I would desire from a part-time job.
good,"Really fun place to work! I wish the internships were paid, because I think they ask a lot of you. Especially in the summer. You work a lot of long concert days."
good,"Working concerts and live events is an amazing experience, have to ha e good customer service so the patrons can enjoy the show and the entire experience. Can definitely be stressful but it's all in how you handle any situation."
good,I worked security at the MidFlorida Amphitheatre. The security manager allowed the backstage staff to handle business without much interference. The hours were long and the pay was low. I enjoyed working shorter hours and being among the guests prior to my assignment backstage.
good,"very fun work place, i would still be working there if i didn't care about how much i get paid. fun concert crowd of people. our job is to keep the patrons safe, by performing pat searches for unsafe items. and securing restricted area's. from each position and every spot you can hear the music"
good,"If you're a music person, it's fun to work. You get to enjoy concerts there and network if you can. However it can be a stressful job too. Overall, I like the company"
good,"Long hours, great work, be the end product is awesome.  I don't know what else to say about the company.  There are serval different departments and aspects of the big machine to make it run."
good,"Worked 3 seasons at Shoreline Amphitheatre in Parking.  Parking lot attendant, crowd management and pedestrian control before and after concerts.  I always enjoyed the job."
good,"Really great group of people and great environment. I was an intern there so I really didn't get an opportunity to learn much about the other departments or team, but from what I saw it was wonderful"
good,"Great benefits, average pay, great company culture. Hard to advance in role. Management like a tight-nit cult. Hard to get into and once there, hard to STAY!"
good,Live Nation was a great experience. The people who work at the company are determined and always willing to help. I would recommend this company for anyone in the event field.
good,Il a été très intéressant de découvrir un festival de musique autrement qu'en tant que festivalier. Ce fut un travail enrichissant et agréable qui correspondait tout à fait à mes attentes et au secteur d'activité qui m'attire. L'équipe de Live Nation a été accueillante et il y avait une bonne entente entre tous.
good,Un dia tipico es sacar todo te los camiones en un pim pan. Montamos y adios. Volvemos y tirar para adelante para irnos todos
good,"Just a great place to work, you are an individual."
good,"Best part of working at Live Nation is hearing great acts for free"
good,A good place for young teens who are looking for something to do in the summer. It is very lively and met some great people while working there.
good,"Creative and fun with supportive management.  I got a chance to really participate in the social media department and help brainstorm content, write content, and learn about the process of creating a concert.  I wanted to do more, but I was only an intern. But it did spark a passion for career in social media."
good,Very long hours but a very rewarding job. Great place to work with some lovely co-workers. The days are long but usually quite fun.
good,"My contacts and associates were a great fun and could be intense group. The projects and creativity required was my driving force. Working under very tight deadlines for a variety of personalities made the job interesting. I enjoyed directing in-house and freelance designers."
good,"Following instruction, reading emails, communicating with management and visitors. Friendly coworkers, fast past environment, fun experience."
good,"I gained a wide variety of experience while working at BMC, which included marketing and project management, to event planning for clients from setup to cleanup."
good,"Live Nation has the perfect enviornment for my field, working with stars and big names like Sting and KISS. Although you may find get connects you are exxpected to work hard which isn't necessarily a bad thing."
good,Was a pleasure to learn from such a great company and industry leader.
good,Es la multinacional lider del sector del entretenimiento.
good,"Good company perks with concerts and off-season time."
good,"As an intern I worked with the department of Premium Seat Sales. I did a lot of research, event planning and marketing. Wore my different hats."
good,"VIP, corporate, or general public - backstage or front desk - always treating them like royalty and striking up light conversation when you're able. Fun!"
good,"Typical day at work is servicing thousands of people as they attend a concert. Either we will be out in the parking lot taking tickets for VIP members or we are inside the venue handling ticket upgrades or selling tickets for future concerts.Management does a terrific job of not only handling the crowds but also the employees. There are multiple teams (maintenance, security, ushers, cashiers, guest services, vendors, etc.) that make up our entire group and all have to function at high levels to make the concert and enjoyable and safe experience overall. The hardest part would be crowd management and making judgements on the fly if we can't reach certain people; that's why my co-workers are sharp and sensible minded individuals. The most enjoyable part is the chaos and overall excitement that comes from concert goers having a good time and listening to great musicians"
good,I enjoy working for Live Nation. I only wish that they took pride in recognizing and graduating their own talent to the next level instead of hiring externally.
good,my very first job it was great i got to meet alot of great stars backstage and fans even friends whom i still speak with today.
good,Responsible for hiring and training of 40 people for sales and/or cashier positions. Supervision of complete setup of the souvenir tent prior to the event and complete tear down of contents when event is finished. Managing of all personnel for all shifts for the 5 day event. Balancing of cash registers with reports on a 4 hour basis.
good,Coordinated with various departments to schedule staff for events.
good,Great work environment and employees are passionate about their work.
good,This is a fun place to be. Everybody seemed to get a long alright and you can't complain with getting to work and see live shows for free and get paid the whole time!
good,Nice part time seasonal work. Flexible schedule. No discounts on anything but provide free soda or water. Great shows amazing people to work with many have been there over 10 years.
good,The times that I worked were very good because it gave you a chance to have another job at a reasonable time. Most of the concerts were on the weekends so it was done on your days off. For the most part I just got to listen to the music and greet people the whole time.
good,I have worked there for 6 yrs and i truly loved it but it is only part time seasonal and at this point in time i need full time employment .its a fun place to work if your trying to just earn extra money it not the kind of job to support a family but the ecperience is forever remembered
good,working at Live Nation is fun and interesting. I get to work with alot of people from the music and show business industry. it is very fast paced. I would consider it as organized Chaos.
good,"Live Nation Parking attendants (at least at Jiffy Lube Live) work as a team and must work in a fast-paced environment. Be prepared to work in all weather, saving for heavy storms."
good,"The job is great when you can shifts. Each shift consists of two 4 hour shifts (load in and load out). Load in is set up of shows, and load out is tear down of shows. Compensation is good. Just hard to get hours from the employees with seniority."
good,You must be able to keep a level head at all times. It is a great job to learn and grow! Management is unfortunately can barely keep their head above water.
good,the management and employees changed up alto it could get heck tick but theirs the plus of getting to watch the concerts food still costed and breaks were 30 minutes at which point you could clock out for the day.
good,"Bosses are great, good environment."
good,"A great place to work for those with a passion for music, plenty of helpful people willing to help you learn about the business."
good,"This was a great company to work for.  The job involved cleaning up after concerts or in preparation for the next concert.  Also involved clean up and some crowd control during shows.   The best part was getting to enjoy a free concert basically.  It is hard work though a lot of walking, working outside in the sun, and a lot of unexpected overtime because you can't leave until all the work is done.  Co-workers are awesome and become friends, but some of the management can be rude and condescending.."
good,"Great work environment, talented peers, lots of opportunity but not at all proactive in keeping talent. Very micro managed at the top."
good,A typical work day would start with loading in the band for the night next we will set up the band and stage for the show next comes sound check doors open fan come in hour later show starts after show we brake down and load out.
good,I really enjoy working here.   I wish I could get on full time and make it a career with this company.  Seems like the type of work I would enjoy doing.
good,It's a job you need common sense and a strong physique for. It can quickly decay weak and easy takers to stimulation so it's not for everyone. I miss it.
good,"Great job, many opportunities to learn from other sellers and resources provided. "
good,management  is good there and very good at making sure that everyone is safe and having a great time. each department works hard together to make everything run smoothly.
good,Great entry level position that gives you a solid foundation for many call center opportunities in the future and offer advancement if you meet criteria.
good,It was a fun job and a great experience but it was not a career.  We basically drove around the artists and take care of them before and after the show.  It did not require much problem-solving skills And could be very mindless at times
good,"Fun place to work. Hours varied weekly and were normally evening to am shifts. Management was pretty flexible with hours, as they knew this was a second job for a good portion of their staff."
good,"Very exciting"
good,Live Nation's workplace culture was great. The individuals there were always kept on their toes making sure all functions of business were complete due to show days or signing new sponsors on. Team oriented environment with positive mindsets.
good,Live Nation was a very good place to work with great people.  It is a high energy and fast-paced work environment.  If the right opportunity presented itself I would go back.
good,"This is a seasonal part time position.  As event staff we conduct  entry control point screening.  On the lookout for contraband, illegal weapons, alcohol and drugs.  Work with VB Sheriff and VB police as required."
good,"Werk was elke keer anders, de problemen oplossen waren wel steeds het zelfde."
good,I cleaned event rooms in the Murat building. I learned how to be self sufficient and a lot about time management. I worked very well along side my co-workers and management. The hardest part about the job was shoveling snow during the winter but I enjoyed everything else about the position.
good,"Job highlights include:"
good,This is a great place to work. I got to network with some of the best people in the world. My team was the best
good,"This job was a good one for the most part. I only say that because I had a run in with a customer that did not end very well. That being said, I did enjoy the job. I moved up to the Team Leader position in my third year. I already knew most of my co-workers from years past so that was a plus. The most difficult part for me was probably training new people. It was the first time I had to in a job and I did not quite know what to say."
good,"Live Nation had a fun, fast-paced culture, until it's merger with Ticket Master.  It's always hard going though a merger, and while the compensation was plentiful, job-security was scarce and many policies/procedures were ignored.  Overall, I did enjoy my tenure there."
good,"My job takes me all over New England, it's really fun. I learned alot more people skills than I already had. The management is very co-ordinated but can be confusing at times. My co-workers are excellent, I chose everyone except my boss, but he is also a great guy. The hardest part of the job is to convince the people to come to the shows or take flyers when they really don't want to hear you. The best part of the job is to see the show you've worked packed to the brim all because you did a great job. It's very rewarding."
good,"If you have common sense and a great attitude and love live music... this is the job for you! Must be able to work with all different types, styles, and shapes of people. Can be very demanding long days, or boring long slow days or a happy medium... no two shows are the same. Should have another job for winter when the season is slow in order to pay bills. Great job for a student or someone who knows their way around the area and is a safe driver."
good,"I was very fortunate to have had a strong, supportive and well experienced supervisor who I had known for year prior to my employment with Live Nation."
good,Loved the job for music and people management could’ve been better. Worked lots of long hours and was never confronted by the big boss. Loved cleaning and working around others who work hard.
good,"I cherish my experience with Live Nation simply because it expose me to raw realism of costumer service. I worked in the box office as the trouble shooter. Every account that had any issue; I was responsible for figuring the issue out and fixing it. Frequently dealing with a displeased costumer. Also often intoxicated costumer sometime would scream, curse and threaten me. However, my job was to solve the problem send the costumer away with getting irate with them and ensure a great experience for the remainder of the evening."
good,"Great team. Really good and fun working environment. Managers are attentive. Interesting work load. "
good,"Working with Live Nation was a very fun experience. Lots of different people to meet and learn from. From helping in the kitchen to learning how to set up catering events, this job was very enjoyable."
good,"If you are looking for extra work, somewhere like this would be good and flexible. It can be stressful as it's dealing with thousands of people in a fast-paced environment, but you'll get used to it. Co-workers can easily make the job much better, and the supervisors are all wonder bosses to work under."
good,"I love everything about this job. The shows are excited, the people are eclectic, and the perks are nice. I wish the uniform were a little more forgiving and cohesive between venues though; it sucks having to buy a million pair of pants for a few hours a weeks."
good,not much room for growth. I worked freelance but have been an assistant for 5 years and the pay seems to decrease for project based jobs. Theres hardly anyone who seems to know how to help with growth
good,"Market leader in live music, exciting and dynamic environment particularly when working at events. Unfortunate dismissive attitude to progression and salary reviews from senior management however."
good,"Overall, an exciting industry to work.  Unfortunately, the job does demand long hours, giving up your nights and weekends.  You can sometimes go a couple of weeks without a day off."
good,you have to be secure with yourself to work for this company
good,"Not a bad company to work for. Job advancements are few and far between. Unless someone quits.  If you enjoy live entertainment then this is the company for you. WARNING, after working or supporting events for years it begins to lose it luster."
good,"I was only there as a contractor, but I really enjoy my team and the culture. I enjoyed the relationships that were cultivated. I would work there again, if the opportunity presented itself."
good,I work at the O2 Apollo in Manchester behind the bar. It's a zero hours contract which is ideal for students like me or as a second job for evening work. Almost all staff are very friendly and helpful. Good communication with management also.
good,"come to work early or on time, management will come out break you into your corresponding groups and outfit you with the materials you'll need that night, while also informing you who is playing, what to do, what to look out for, and what to properly maintain during your shift.it is very important to stay properly hydrated and be weary of the sun. if you feel feint or sick at any time you should tell someone or seek help to insure that your okay. At the end of the day getting people out of the parking lot can be tricky, its important to work with the other employees to properly insure the smooth transition of letting all the cars out without causing problems."
good,Fast paced environment that always provided a challenge with different and unique issues at hand.  Team atmosphere is great as everyone is helpful including Managers.
good,I was responsible for maintaining the property. It was my responsibility to make sure the property was ready for a concert to perform. It was my responsibility to order all supplies and products for the venue.
good,I've only worked a few concerts so far but I've enjoyed it every single time I've been called in to work. The catering crews are always so helpful if you ever need help with anything.
good,"I really enjoyed this internship! While it was unpaid, I gained a breath of communications and customer service experience. Everyone I worked with was ridiculously nice and helpful and I still keep in contact with many today."
good,"morning calls and evening calls"
good,Very fun and exciting place to work if you are passionate about music.
good,"Super ambiance, même si nous choisissons pas les missions. L'ambiance est top"
good,"It's a very warm and welcoming family type of restaurant feel. They have live music and private events and different floors and somehow you gravitate towards all of it. All of it is fascinating and amazing the artwork, the music, the culture, the people. It's a very awesome company to have fun and enjoy work!"
good,Great music and all events are very nice of all kinds of music Secruity staff are very great people and many events to listen to great music meeting the artist
good,"A typical day was to just do the work assigned."
good,"It’s a really great place to work, you meet a lot of people and you get to hear some great music on the job. I would recommend this for anybody looking for some great part-time work."
good,"Good Work Environment "
good,"This job is fast-paced, and requires you to stand for long hours. Managers and Supervisors are on you a lot. But, if you enjoy music and the environment that comes with a concert venue, then this is the job for you."
good,"Working for the venue is a fun experience.  You get to greet, meet and add to the experience for many customers, you get to attend the concerts while getting paid, you get exposed to different genres of music and over all it's a great time."
good,"Live Nation Merchandise will always be a special place for me. Mainly because of my boss. She was awesome and explained things well. She's a great leader and I felt like I was on a team."
good,"it is an enjoyable atmosphere whether checking ID's, Bag Checks, scanning tickets or working inside the venue or backstage. Management always has your back and makes it a friendly place to work. We have many concerts or events that we get paid to enjoy."
good,I believe it was a great internship and a great learning experience. My internship mentor taught me a ton and was really great at guiding me throughout my career
good,"Les journées de travail sont éprouvantes mais très correctement organisées et rythmées. "
good,"As an Usher, a typical day at work would consist of scanning patrons tickets at the front entrance, seating patrons within the theatre, blocking unauthorized exits, relocating patrons, and occasionally assisting with meet and greets after the show. This was my first job that I begun working at when I was 16 years of age. Being that this job requires constant person to person interaction, over the years this job has helped me gain social skills and has also taught me how to handle confrontation amongst unsatisfied patrons. The management at the NYCB Theatre is very structured. They all show true passion for their work and keep the history of the Theatre alive. The managers and employees are very team oriented, the show does not go on unless everyone is on board. The hardest part about the job is tending to difficult patrons. In every situation you are always expected to act professional and respectful. Often times I am challenged with maintaining a professional and respectful approach, however I successfully do so. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to watch and enjoy all of the performers who come to the venue. It is nice to see patrons enjoy the artists they are passionate about. The vibe at the venue is always upbeat and positive. This job allows me to continue working on my summer and winter breaks from college."
good,Friendly and neat environment. Work while listening to the performers. Meeting the performers/celebrities. The manager staff is also nice. It was just a great experience to work there. I love it.
good,"Working and walking outside in the sun. Bending over to pick up rubbish. Sweeping, mopping, wiping, power-washing, maintaining, restocking, and cleaning. Most enjoyable part of the job is getting to listen to the live concert even from afar since the music is so loud. A lot of walking since the place is a huge place to cover."
good,Decent place to work with a great laid back culture. Not the worse place to work but there are other places where you can make more for doing the same amount of work.
good,"Walking around venue, keeping and eye on patrons,to ensure that they are following the rules and regulations."
good,"I operated the Live Nation mobile application for the iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch. I covered over 50 concerts and shows at the Theater of Living Arts and Tower Theater in Philadelphia, PA. I managed content that was pushed through the application such as live set lists, and exclusive photos of the bands. Live set lists in the application were linked directly to iTunes which allowed concert goers to download the music that the artists were playing instantly to their phones. I ultimately served as a conduit between the artists and the app users to enhance their overall concert experience. The application program was disbanded in May of 2012."
good,I learned so much about managing relationships. Wonderful experience!
good,"A typical day consisted of 16 hours of concert preparation including: load-in, sound check, staff meetings, crowd management / safety, load-out."
good,"Fast paced exciting atmosphere that taught me a lot about working for a major facility. Use of handyman tools and learned basic knowledge of building operations and maintenance. coworkers great to work with, extremely long hours sometimes up to 20 days without a day off. Feeling of reward once the show plays off and all jobs are done."
good,I managed several teams who would divide up into areas with the highest population centers and pass out information to people on their way to work or lunch. Some local spots to hit are fun and enjoyable because they are normally band concerts. I like the challenge of workplace with the fun atmosphere on the side.
good,Working with Live Nation Middle East is a very challenging experience. Even though being a receptionist it's not only answering calls and welcoming guest in our office but when there's an event i'm also helping out to meet all the requirements to be done so that the event will be successful.
good,"Working at live nation was one of the best experiences i have had working at a company. Management was great! they do a end of the year party for the employees, where they have food, and do some raffles and other enjoyment. Working live nation concerts means you get to hear great entertainment and get paid to do so."
good,"I've worked here for three going on four years now, and I honestly can say that I enjoy working here. The people are wonderful, the shows are awesome, and if it weren't for a few drunk people at the shows, I'd say that everyone should at least try working in a similar environment."
good,This job gave me a great opportunity to learn new skills and experience working with large groups of people and being able to control crowd's it also helped my customer service skills by interacting with the public and trouble shooting
good,its a fun place to work . the managers are great . they want you  succeed at their venue . they are always looking how some way to praise their team in every way
good,Live Nation has many opportunities to work on a variety of projects. Management tries to involve anyone interested in expanding their knowledge of other systems.
good,"This was a fun job after school. It was a great experience in catering, along with learning what the other cooks had to teach. It was also a great experience to hear all the bands preforming while you cook."
good,Pretty much said it all already. I have to write 150 characters though so I am writing more just to use space I guess if I had to say more about it I would say block the haters.
good,"I get to pick my hours "
good,Working here is good if you like music and stuff like that. Just don't expect to see a lot of it unless you're posted somewhere inside the music area.
good,Many exciting firm wide events and meet many people from different backgrounds. Very dynamic and open culture such as company sponsored mingling monthly event with hard drinks and finger foods.
good,"Management is awesome, security staff is amazing and I call them my work family for a good reason they always worked as a team no matter the situation"
good,"worked the VIP gate for a season with a professional group of fellow officers. that made the job very pleasant. 20,000 seat band venue with alcohol being the main sales product."
good,Live Nation is a very fun and positive venue for artists and musicians. Each event is different and challenging. The music presentations are very coordinated and require a lot of cooperation from the participants and employees. I am a musician myself and I find it very exciting and enjoyable to be a part of the team.
good,"May work there again next season. What I did was clean under the tent, seats,  lawn,  bathrooms.  Good place to work.  See and hear different concerts."
good,This company offers a great working environment. My specific location is highly organized and everybody works well with one another. Employees are offered free meals if a work day is more than 5 hours long.
good,"I enjoyed working at Lakewood Amphitheater. Interacting and assisting guests in and being able to listen and see the performances became exciting. A typical day at work is about 1500 people that all wants to have a good time and enjoy the artist that they have come to support. I've learned several things being apart of this opportunity such as what's dangerous to allow in the area, how to approach a guest in any situation, and how to just have a great time. There was no hard job or tasks that I've been assigned to. I enjoyed every part of what I was assigned to do."
good,Its a good environment to be around and the staff are all nice. It can be slow at times but then again it can be really busy. I sell lawn chairs for Live Nation and its only part time but its a fun place to be around.
good,Escort people to there seats. management is good and can be helpful. As a team people work together Can get to leave early if need be. Crouds can be loud and so can the music.
good,I was an intern and it was very fun to be in an environment that was laid back. Hollywood is a great area to work in. Loved the after work performances and open bar.
good,"Everything gets done on time, most employees are helpful and always willing to work late to get things done.  The employees are all happy and helpful to one another."
good,"I love working with this company and would love to grow with them but I don't think anyone ever moves from their positions.  The job offers excellent benefits and perks, I'd love to be a full time employee."
good,"My typical day at work consisted of signing in and then getting briefed by the supervisors/managers about specific things about the event everyone should be aware of. The shifts I worked were from 4-5 hours long. On one shift, I was asked if I was interested in working  (earning) some extra hours. (over time). It's cool, because there is no pressure applied. It's up to you."
good,"Live Nation has a great culture at its office. Weekly/Monthly in-house artist showcases, complimentary coffee bar downstairs, daily food trucks, and DOGs everywhere. Management is friendly too and there is a lot of room for growth within the company."
good,Although they don't give you many hours it is a nice summer job or something you could have as a 2nd job. The work environment overall was great and people that I worked with were all really nice.
good,This was probably the most fun job I have ever had but sadly it was only really a summer time employment so had to find a more long term career. If I could do it year round with guaranteed hours I would jump at the chance.
good,I did enjoy this job a lot. We basically get to enjoy a concert while getting paid for it. All we did was check tickets to make sure they were valid and helped guest throughout the show.
good,"A typical day at live nation is you either scanning tickets, or checking tickets to make sure people are sitting where they are supposed to. Sometimes you have to call security on really rowdy people or the medics on overly intoxicated people. You learn how to be firm and tough. The management is a little all over the place, because you're not too sure who is in charge of what, there's a lot of people in charge and they don't know who you are. The people are nice to work with. The hardest part of the job is unruly guests and the most enjoyable part is listening to the concerts."
good,"I would get to work anywhere from 12am-3pm. clock in, start helping set-up barriers before the crowds would show up, once the concert goers showed up we would check tickets, and help groups or individuals to there seats, and help with and fights or over beveraged persons. at the end of concerts we would help people out and pick up trash on our way out. once all of the patrons have left the team would sometime get food catering by the command post. over all most of the supervisors were extremely professional and helpful."
good,great place to work. only thing is some of the teams and departments can be cliquey. Do not work there if you are looking for co workers who are friendly and want to get to know you. Perks are great though!
good,"Sociable, open environment, not many women, get to see free concerts, tough to advance, pay is OK, typical corporate structure"
good,"The people I worked with became my family.  Summer is very busy and hectic, but working with these people made is feel fun rather than intense.  The environment is fast paced, but worth it when you see a crowd of people all singing a Foo Fighters song."
good,"There is no ""typical"" work day working with Live Nation. Every day brings new surprises and challenges. Much of the job requires quick decision making but most importantly, Customer Service. Live Nation essentially manages the production for mostly arena, stadium, and amphitheater concerts. We make sure all of the outside companies (construction, audio, flooring, etc) all have what they need and are on schedule. Much of the job is working with different personalities and adapting to the cultures of each company."
good,"Live Nation is a great company to work for.  It is very fast paced and diverse with excellent perks.  the work/life balance is the only draw back, but is obtainable with proper personal boundaries."
good,"I just currently started working there. My first day on the job was   smooth sailing. Everyone was so nice. Usually we are assigned a post when we arrive at work, we usually work in teams or groups. if you're working up at the gates, you are doing a routine security check which means we are checking pockets, bags, purses , boots. certain things are not allowed inside the amphitheater  such as large umbrellas, anything that might cause any harm or get in the way of the costumer enjoying the show. Other than that it's a cool job, I'm security so I have it pretty easy, you may deal with some intoxicated people or might have to tell a few people to pipe down or deal with a fight or accident. you'll definitely have some stories to tell your friends and family."
good,The brand has great reach but no one really goes to the site directly. Most of the traffic coming in sideways. Too transnational of a site. don't suggest working there.
good,"I personally, loved this job. It will keep you on your toes, you must be ready for anything. Not a good job for the elderly or under 18. No benefits, but good pay."
good,"fun job, I get paid to enjoy concerts while helping patrons. The company has a great pay system and management is top notch"
good,"Live Nation Entertainment (LNE) has been an excellent place to work. My co-workers are intelligent and hard-working. The management has generally been responsive and helpful. The Seattle dev office is located in Pioneer Square, with great access to public transit, and lots of food options at lunch time."
good,I had to scan tickets and let people in if they were valid. I also had to work long hours in-till early in the morning. I was a very hard worker they said and was very nice to the people coming in.
good,Work hard but the rewards are wonderful. The company provides excellent entertainment for clients. Truly is a fun place to work!
good,"Clock in, and stark directing traffic."
good,"Very fun and positive surroundings."
good,"exciting and fast paced, always new things happening and great people to work with"
good,"It's a fun job that I can do on the side.  I get to work while going to shows.  I enjoy the people I work with, just wished they would give me more hours."
good,"Good work environment, friendly staff, overall good management."
good,Over the years I have learned that the Job or work field is where you learn to be a great employee to your team members and leaders. Consistently provide the great working experience to complete task and provide great customer /client care relationships. I am a fast learner with great knowledge of what it take to complete a deadline and know that month end closings are where ones should be the most consistent to solving and fixing issues that may arise
good,"Friendly co workers, fun company, great healh benefits. Environment continues to change and evolve."
good,"Great culture, lovely place to work. Some hiring managers driven and dedicated to their jobs HR function needs fixing."
good,Loved working here especially as a second job! Best way to enjoy the music industry and get paid for it. Most of the managers are wonderful in The Atlanta area. As long as you do your job you will not have any problems. There is area for advancement but not that many positions.
good,Loved working here but the pay is extremely low and left because of it.  Worked long hours but loved my team and boss so was not too bad.   Would have stayed if they had competitive pay
good,would clock in the afternoon when call time was stated in emails. I loved talking to the different people that would arrive for the concerts and I loved seeing the concerts as well when I would be able to look as well. the management was great and they usually walked around to make sure that we were doing alright since we were in the sun most of the time. I loved my time there and it was perfect for my summer schedule.
good,"I had a good experience at Live Nation overall. I was able to work with many industry professionals and learn about the trade. However, the culture is fast paced and as an intern I found that I was often overlooked or neglected during busy hours."
good,Working for Live Nation was and is a lot of fun get to meet many great people and experience! Seen some great concerts and it has made my summer unforgettable! This is a job everyone wishes they had! And I hope to continue and come back next summer as well!
good,"A typical day at work was good, the major responsibilities were making sure that the patrons behaved, and answering any questions they had. The hardest part was dealing with difficult or inebriated patrons."
good,I love working with all of my co worker's I enjoy being around them all and we work as a team and we don't talk negative about one another it's nice to
good,This job requires security guards to constantly be ready. The environment of each concert is always different and leaves the security officers with many crazy stories.
good,"great company - great work ice balance, good people and fun! free gig tickets and amazing team! people stay in these jobs because the rewards are so good!"
good,Long hours and lots of standing as well as dealing with difficult guests. but the concerts are always good and it's nice to spend time with other people your age at a concert for free.
good,A typical day at work was going around parking cars in an organized and safe fashion.  I learned how to work in a group to ensure  things went smoothly.
good,I typically cleaned the venues after every concert or event at the PNC music pavilion. The work environment was great. We had access to the live music before our shifts started.
good,"Great company to work for. Must be willing to work hard, at times travel, and work long hours. In the end though it's all worth it. Compensation is very fair for the time you put in. It's not necessary, but having a background in stage work is very helpful."
good,"- ticket sales and wristbands for customers."
good,"Large corporation with smart people and good management. Most enjoyable aspects include autonomy, team support, network. The hardest part of the job would be sitting in a desk all day."
good,"I worked as an Accountant at Live Nation which is a great company to work for with their benefits and culture. The management are very nice and the office is in a great location by the Olympic Village. The perks of going to see a lot of the shows and big artist was great."
good,Live Nation's culture is great and provides a super friendly environment. A typical day at work consists of being on a computer all day but the office environment is very lenient.  Management is great but there is very little to no room for growth in my department.
good,"A typical day in rock in roll?  There is no such thing..."
good,I enjoyed the experience of working for Live Nation. It really helped prepare me for my second real job because you meet so many people and learn how to act with customers of all different types. It was a very positive and memorable experience that I would definitely do again.
good,Best part of working at Live Nation is hearing great acts for free. Management to earth. I love working here!
good,"I have only been with live nation for a short time but I really enjoy it so far. They even gave me a job in the box office, which pays more, after only a few months! I started in Guest Services, which doesn't pay much but is a good starting point if you want to get into the industry without much experience. You see a lot of fun shows and have the opportunity to meet a lot of influential people in the music industry! A few downfalls is working out in the cold, having to stand in one place for long periods of time, and not always getting enough hours. If you prove you want to be there, put in extra effort and work hard without complaints they seem to be pretty accommodating."
good,"I work in security for Live Nation.  This position includes wanding each guest before entering the venue,  bag checks, checking to make sure the patrons are safe and have not overheated, and securing the venue for a good concert to be experienced by all."
good,Laid back and get to pick your own hours. Management is nice and helpful. Long and stressful closes each month end that last for four days. Friendly co workers.
good,"Live Nation has amazing benefits such as free concerts and live shows. Unfortunately there isn't much work/life balance .Management gives little to no recognition for the amount of work and hours some people dedicate to their job. Human resources department does nothing to monitor or enhance your progress within the company. "
good,"Typical work day working for security at Live Nation PNC Arts Center location was come into work fifteen minutes early and go over the staff meeting. The meeting consisted of who was playing, where people will be posted, job responsibilities for the day, certain passes and backstage rules, and always stressing customer service.  Supervisors had their teams normally set for every event unless there was a lack of ticket sales or abundance of ticket sales.  If this occurs people would be relocated to a different post."
good,"The hardest part of the job is letting customers down because it can be very stressful when handling ticket options.  But, the workplace culture and environment makes up for it because the people are great."
good,"The job itself is not difficult, once you get the hang of it. It is also repetitive, but in a good way that makes you feel like you know what you're doing."
good,"Check peoples tickets to an entrance, protect the audience and performers."
good,This job is very rewarding because I get a chance to work with the direct public and people from different backgrounds. It gives me the opportunity to network and meet new people for different opportunities.
good,"I love working for Live Nation. The work is fun, easy, management is amazing, you become a part of the live nation family pretty quickly. Management places you where you're bound to succeed from your personal strengths within the company. I will work as many seasons as possible!"
good,"There are many things I learned while working at this venue was somethings like teamwork, learning how to work with different aged people, and different types of people. A typical day at work can be very long but they make sure they take care of us, they give us free meals and water when its really hot, and makes sure we have jackets when its cold."
good,"Enjoyed working with the Team and there's lots of scope to learn and develop on advanced skills."
good,"Everything about working for Live Nation was great. I loved my coworkers, bosses, and overall atmosphere. I learned how to be patient with rowdy concert-goers but also to try and mirror the same energy and enthusiasm so that they would be excited for the experience. The hardest part of working was that the breaks were short and flew by, but when your job is enjoyable, it's not too bad."
good,"Fast paced job with lots of travel. throughly enjoyed working for live nation. "
good,"I loved working for Live Nation. I never had any problems working for this Company. Uniforms were provided and washed everyday. There was always a new well known Band that brought at minimum 7,000 people. The most my location ever had was 16,000. The job was always thrilling and always had great bands coming in all the time, whom a lot of the time you`d get to meet!. The management was very helpful and allowed me to do my job proficiently and without their constant disapproval in my methods. They were so surprised in the amount of Security knowledge I had, that I was given any position at the event that I wanted. My methods were always praised for their professionalism and I was always acknowledged by management, who took the time to get to know all of their workers. Breaks were given whenever needed and were even encouraged especially at larger events. A ""prep"" talk was given before every event and praises were given at the end, of course they will explain the errors of our ways as well but honestly if you do your job right there was no problems in the slightest. This was the best Security Company I have ever worked for and I would highly recommend them."
good,"I was hired as a seasonal worker at a local outdoor venue. I don't really have any complaints. Everything wasn't spectacular but it wasn't bad at all either. "
good,This is a great part time job. It's typically one night a week and your generally off by 11pm. Fun environment. Our motto is Fans creating once in a lifetime experiences for fans.
good,Worked on implementation for iprocurement and isupplier. Typical day would be to work on production support issue around oracle EBS
good,It could be a fun place to work if it was managed better. They need a better system in screening the people that they hire. Managers could use more training in how to address the workers.
good,Being a security officer can be challenging working in a place like this. Dealing with the public you have to know how to handle yourself and be respectable at the same time.
good,"You get to see all the local concerts, and get paid! It is great for people who love music, and can stand on feet long time. Co-workers are great. The best part is seeing all the bands."
good,"Best job ever,I just wish they paid me better,I love the job,I work hard, but it's still a fun great place to work,the shows are free,people are great,there isn't more to say ,I love my job,thank you livenation,thank you,❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤"
good,bright lights big stages dont be fooled meet alot of people and celebrities but no growth in positions worked here for 9 years never got a thankyou or career plan
good,"I worked at Live Nation for close to 15 years. Good days / bad days / slow growth / slow compensation rewards, in fact, I was significantly under compensated for many, many years. Worked hard, loved my job, put my life on hold for the demands of show business, which is a 24 / 7 industry. A lot of love for my time spent their during my career."
good,"Working at Live Nation at South Beach was a dream. Unfortunately, I only worked at the box office when there were shows. It was fun and I got to see the shows for free after the box office closed."
good,Getting to work at outside concert events is a fun summertime job for some extra cash. Long hours on your feet but always busy. Must be able to deal with people in high volumes.
good,"This was the best job I have ever had in my entire life. Yes, it was physically demanding, however that was the only complaint I have about the job. It was truly great."
good,"Very proactive and entertaining atmosphere. Never a dull moment of work."
good,It was a great and interesting job. I got to see a lot of shows while working. Live nation worked with my schedule. Flexible hours and I got to pick up hours if I needed.
good,"Casual but professional atmosphere. Allow people to make decisions, be their self and encourage diversity and individualism. Fun, entertaining and satisfying work."
good,"Worked on tour, therefore, did not get to see the work environment of Live Nation. We worked alongside Live Nation Korea and not really the staff of Live Nation, therefore I cannot say much."
good,This job was really fun for me. I was probably out of my depth but I feel like I landed on my feet thanks to the training that was provided. Great perks. Great parties.
good,This job is the best job to have as a teenager or college student! I HIGHLY recommended it for those exact two. Or even a part time job but only if you don’t mind traveling!
good,What you get out of working at LN is ultimately what you make of it. The effort you put in and relationships you build will define your impact and experience.
good,"A typical day involved updating the websites as well as papering for shows that were coming up, and using social media marketing. I learned a lot about what goes on to put on a successful show."
good,"One Of the best Job Experiences Of My life. I always had healthy challenges, I really enjoyed that every day was different. I learned so much about  what it takes to effectively produce amazing live experiences!"
good,Live Nation is music heaven! I loved working at the Fillmore in both San Francisco and Denver!! The management is cool and the crew is the BEST. Got to see all my bucket list shows.
good,I made so many friends through this job. talking to people all day and night at the concerts was the best. I didn't learn too much as it was just hands on but I wouldn't trade my experience
good,"been with LN for over a year, never a dull moment. fun job, something new everyday. never the same old same old like most jobs.  would recommend, but hours arent always there if u need fulltime."
good,I loved working here but the pay for a loader it not enough. The location I was working at was an old building that was dangerous to load in and out. I couldn't continue to work here to reach my financial goals.
good,"The company culture is great; I learned how to create enticing digital media productions for our events. I created videos, content and figured out interesting ways to gain new customers."
good,"-Come in 1.5 before show starts and prep"
good,"great place to work at a decent pay.  Fun work, and interesting people all contained in an extremely fast paced environment.  Free shows would be the best benefit."
good,Absolutely loved this company while interning! Lots of freedom within the office. Great culture and experiences if you have the opportunity to work on-site for shows!
good,"My experience with Live Nation has been nothing but positive. Fun job, fun people, great concerts. I love getting to make sure that eveyone is having a great concert experience."
good,"great teams i worked with especially the finance team, great work environment, very good contract role that was combined with very high intellectual capacity."
good,I have worked at the Jacobs Pavilion venue for two years now and each year it keeps getting better. The hardest part is dealing with people who have a little too much to drink and try to break the rules.  It is great to work as a team and keep everyone in line.  Overall it is a great atmosphere.
good,Laid back but still challenging work place. There is plenty to do throughout the year. During the busy season can be filled with many types of live entertainment keeping you busy almost constantly.
good,Great job to have. Fast paced and exciting. New concerts every year as well as some of the same. Enjoyable but only seasonal.
good,"It was an internship, and honestly one of the best internships I have ever got. The team members are very passionate about what they do and were always willing to teach and explain about what was happening at all times."
good,In my time at Live Nation I was awarded the opportunity to learn about a new realm of the communications industry. I saw the ins and outs of sponsorship and events with many of the higher level employees willing to bring interns under their wings to teach them more.
good,"at live nation you will encounter with numerous of different people "
good,"Managed a high-volume workload within a deadline-driven environment. Deliver outstanding service, exceed expectations and build long-term loyalty.Loaded proper materials while abiding by all safety and legal standards. Work in team and in a self-directed environment."
good,Great environment with equally great people that are always there to help. Many opportunities to learn as much as possible with different work environments that allow learning at different paces. It provided a diverse experience that I would love to bring to a new employer.
good,"Everyone acts like a team. People are very friendly. The work environment at LN is work hard, play harder. I actually felt as if my work was valued there. Best part about the job is free concert tickets."
good,Fast-paced. Never gets boring. Good experience learned. Fun for summer time.
good,"Live Nation is the best in the entertainment industry.  Everyone there works hard to produce incredible events and shows! Busy season is busy, busy but really rewarding."
good,"There is always something to do and learn. "
good,"This was one of the tougher places to fit in. It was a pure work related environment with little culture. There was high turnover with most people I saw coming in staying less than a month! "
good,"I enjoy working for this company because they give you a project to complete and trust that you can and will do it. All they ask is that you do your job and don't act like a fan should you come into contact with the talent. There are a few specific rules regarding the talent, but that's a given in this industry."
good,I loved the work environment. It was very casual with a professional twist. My co-workers and department as a whole was amazing. I couldn't ask for more out of a company.
good,"I worked for Live Nation in Holmdel NJ for eight seasons.  Hours were perfect to be able to have this as a second job."
good,Work is very flexible and can easily be worked as a second job. Working in clean-up there is very enjoyable and your co-workers and supervisors make the place even more fun.
good,If you like Seasonal Work then this is the job for you.  Its a great place to watch free concerts and shows.  You get to experience and see what fans go through when inside and outside the venue.
good,"While working at LiveNation, I learned that concert goers are always hungry and always want a beer. The stands are usually packed with customers, but once the show starts, you get a free concert while getting paid to work"
good,"With thousands of people that came to experience their favorite music, they would make each day exciting and never a dull moment. Sometimes it would feel overwhelming, but problem solving and new ideas made it exhilarating. Having an exceptional team and teamwork is what made the experience fun."
good,I love working for Live Nation Dallas. For the most part the staff is really great with the exception of someone in particular in upper management. I don't like subtle misogyny.
good,"Be positive, energetic, smile, and enthusiastic! You will love the job and you have very understanding bosses! Verrry friendly staff and guest as well"
good,"If you like music, this is the place for you! "
good,Enjoyed the atmosphere but the 18 hour days were brutal. A typical day at work was 6am-1am. I learned time management skills as well as organizational communication skills. The hardest part of the job was the extremely long hours. The most enjoyable part of the job was working backstage with rockstars!
good,Ability to build professional relationships. A fast paced job environment. A variety of likeliness in everyday music and gaining customer skills. Rewards and employee discounts.
good,Wonderful company to work for that cares about employees and their relation to the customer rather than only considering the customer. Only stressful on show days.
good,A typical day at work included folding chairs and setting up for concerts that were held at the venue I was employed at. I had great coworkers that helped me and knew what they were doing.
good,"Production Assistant provides all support for talent, stocking tour buses and VIP rooms to grocery shopping and transportation to and from airport, hotel and venue for the artist and other industry employees. The 12-24hour shift is the hardest part of the job, however the environment and caliber of people being worked for makes the job worth every minute."
good,"Live Nation is the leading provider of event tickets and venue in the nation. I work within the emergency services sector of my particular venue and daily I record medical incidents that occur within the venue. Management is okay, I really believe they need formal training and that the venue needs to be severely updated. I generally do not see many coworkers based on where I am positioned in the venue, but we all possess customer service skills. The hardest part of my job is sometimes mustering patience for patrons who are excessively drunk and are brought to my office. The pay is also pretty terrible and they do not offer yearly raises. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing customers happy and satisfied with the job I have provided."
good,I loved it but so hard to get another job with them. I did and internship and the venue couldn’t afford to keep me there full or part time even. so sad
good,"I like working at live nation, its fun exciting and never a dull moment. You get to ne a part of the event and different one nightly.  I love the team effort I feel their"
good,Working for live Nation is like an ladder...there is room for growth and new experience. You can also work for other venues under the umbrella of LiveNation worldwide
good,"Really cool work atmosphere, but long hours that can mess with ones flexibility. Not a lot of room for advancement, however you can make a lot of connections."
good,Only a seasonal employee so don't get enough hours to cover cost of living. It's just a fun job for extra change in a pocket. Management excellent and so are MOST all the supervisors. Get to hear and see all the concerts so that's a plus. Don't see any advancement opportunities although I've heard there are.
good,"Fantastic crew of people to work with, all very friendly and helpful. It is great to work for a company who values its employees and guests so much. I love working there every summer."
good,I worked as a ticket taker and security guard. It's a very fast paced job. The hours are okay. You only get paid on the 15th and 30th of each month. The job did not offer enough hours.
good,Livenation is a wonderful and fun and exciting place to work. It’s extremely hard to get a full time position but Livenation offers many other part time seasonal jobs
good,Live Nation is a great company. You get to work at different venues and see different shows. I enjoyed working with the people and getting the experience I did.
good,Easy going and concert heavy work days that are enjoyable. Everyone mostly gets along with each other and there is so much to see at one venue. It never really gets old.
good,Working at the Lube as we called it was very exciting.  I met many different famous people and bands and had to take care of all their daily needs because they could not leave the venue.  I really enjoyed my job at Jiffy Lube.  It was an amazing place to work
good,"The job is great and relaxed. The pay is decent. Other call centers pay much more, but for the work you do it is right on the nose. Supervisors are cool."
good,"Work on call for events and concerts at a large outdoor venue as well as catering to large numbers of people before, during, and after an event.  Direct and make decisions as well as being able to communicate with guest/customers and take directions and follow through on those orders.  Working many hours on feet, be able to stand large crowds, to greet and please people.  Each season the staff is getting more professional and organized."
good,I thoroughly enjoyed the job. I got to meet a lot of amazing people and work with a hardworking team. I could see how it wasn't for everybody because of the long hours and loud music. The environment was fun and interactive for the most part.
good,"A typical day at work can vary. You can be strictly a ticket taker, work inside the concert or work VIP. I learned how to spot a runner(someone trying to get in for free), new music varying on different concerts and how to work extended hours. Management is very reliable and will help out with any questions you may have. My coworkers were fun upbeat people. The hardest part of my job was working with a lot of people but once you have done it for 2 weeks it becomes very natural after. The most enjoyable part of my job was being apart of all the action. Some jobs can be very boring but this particular job is a great first one!"
good,Working as a production runner I have experienced the intense process that happens in order to execute a successful concert. On a normal day I will show up at the venue before everyone arrives and make sure there is coffee and water for the stage hands before eating breakfast with my fellow runners. The tour then arrives and I am given my days budget and tasks which include shopping for the tour and an artists and crew transportation schedule. I basically do whatever is needed to make the tours time at the venue as pleasant as possible and get people where they need to go. The best part of this job is working around music which is my favorite thing in life. At the end of a long and hard day its always rewarding to see a concert on stage and sometimes meet and transport the artists after the show is over.
good,"Live Nation is the largest LIVE MUSIC EVENT Corporations in the world, the produce the top musical concerts, tours and festivals"
good,"I was honored to be able to work for this large entertainment corporation. While working out of my home office I communicated with Art director in LA on a regular bases. I directed the design of merchandise and product lines for big name musicians and entertainers in the industry. Worked with a pool of in-house and freelance designers developing both retail designs and tour product. I enjoyed working with creative team and loved putting the product lines together. While in this position I was asked to design a wide range of products, from basic imprinted apparel designs to shoes, pop display , jewelery etc. It was challenging at times meeting tight deadlines while dealing with client uncertainty and changes. Great satisfaction gained upon line completion seeing designs at the shows and on the wall and racks of major retailers."
good,Live nation offers a friendly environment for workers and provides decent benefits.
good,The environment provided by Live Nation in general was productive and fun. Work areas were well equipped and maintained by staff on hand. Kitchen and recreation areas provided a place to relax during breaks. Unfortunately the drive for me was more than 60 miles one way and there was limited room for advancement. An excellent place to work at but without being able to advance it put my career in a stand still.
good,"Depending on your department, it can be a fun and great place to work. Great flexibility and amazing benefits! Overall, highly recommend company, with lots of growth."
good,"Live Nation and its subsidiaries provide concert management, security, and logistical support to artists and performers in a number of local and international venues."
good,A great place to work. You can choose what shifts you want to do. Work as many concerts as you want. A great place if you love concerts. The shifts are about 7 hours long some days there are longer shifts. Management is great and they care a lot about you.
good,So the work that is expected fro  you is very much achievable. Just like anything new in your life it can be a struggle at first to adapt to this work environment but it is doable. Management is almost always disconnected from their employees however their supervisors can be a bit of a monarchy and ask for the same level of respect that is given to a king.
good,"LiveNation is a mostly upbeat concert hall that can hold thousands of people at a time. It can be very hectic at times and too slow at others. I do feel at home and part of a family when i'm there. Almost every employee is kind and it's just a beautiful atmosphere to be in and be a part of creating for the fans. There are no ticket discounts though so i paid for my DREAM TICKET...FULL PRICE. But the pay is decent enough to do it, though it's a seasonal part time position."
good,Live nation is a great company to work for. Everyone loves being able to listen to great live music while working. All shifts are at night which is inconvenient but expected and ushers only make minimum wage. All together a terrific working environment.
good,"I had worked there happily, the day would always go by quickly. I was an Ecare specialist and was prompted to be set in HD but due to personal unforeseen circumstances, I had to leave the state. The very next day the HR dept had called me asking if I was okay. Due to me being a top performer, they offered me my job back if I ever came back to Texas. However, when coming back a year later I took them up on their offer and its been a year since then and it's still been very difficult to get any information on getting my job back. It's very disappointing because I loved this job, every part of it. I figure that my performance would speak for itself but it seems that they're only interested in hiring their friends. It is a very good job if you're a fresh face but if you're a rehire, good luck."
good,"Anyone would be Lucky to have  a Live Nation Career. The only problem is the waiting game. Climbing up is a slow process, understandably so. You cannot sustain yourself just on this job."
good,"I enjoy the venues, artists and being able to have a less stressful job part time. I enjoy the group of people who have common interest in Live Nation as a whole."
good,"I had never been to a concert before working with Live Nation and let me tell you I had the time of my Life with this company every concert. Although I was working it never felt like it , I always enjoyed myself even on the long nights (inclimate weather too)"
good,The busy hours were stressful and standing for 11 hours on average during a shift was difficult but the people you meet when parking the cars and the staff you work with make a great work environment not to mention the fact that you get a live music performance while you work.
good,"I really loved working with LiveNation and they really do care about you and will go the extra mile to make it right for you! Overall, great company!!"
good,Fun place to work at & build discipline & work .. a lot of days off. More days was needed for temporary job location. It was fun while it lasted. More years to build
good,Enjoyable with all kinds of music menu's to see and experience.  Truly nice co-workers to work with.  Calendar set per month and easy to add into for new shows at end of summer. Free parking.
good,I love working for Live Nation as a Production Runner cause it is an awesome behind the scenes view into the day of a concert or event. I get to meet a lot of tour personnel and have learned a lot of valuable knowledge about myself and the concert industry.
good,"Live Nation is a well positioned company, well connected with unlimited potential.  The department I worked in was a creative one, with many different projects going at once.  It was fast paced and management empowered you to manage your responsibilities."
good,"As much as I love working at a concert venue for the chance to make other fans experiences as enjoyable as I would want mine to be, the management makes it difficult. For the most part, they are all part time workers like me, yet feel like they have earned something just because they have been doing this simple job for so long. The job is to stand in a assigned section, to allow no one without the proper ticket permissions to go through, and sometimes move chairs."
good,"It's a fun fast paced job. Meet a lot of interesting people and enjoy the concerts. The management is great. You must be a people person, with good communication skills."
good,"On your feet the whole shift but you're constantly moving so the shift goes by fairly quick. Staff is easy to get along with. Only negative aspect is you know your start time but never know you end time. Also, not much opportunity for advancement or a raise."
good,Great place to work because of very understanding management and great department culture. Typically we would park around 7-10 thousand cars on their respective lots due to what they pad for parking. I learned customer service skills and how to efficiently an safely execute traffic control. Hardest part of the job is the heat of the sun beaming on you when its 104 degrees in July; no shade in the parking lots. Best part of the job
good,It is a great work environment. Your managers have your back and there hands on if need be. I may work long hours would i wouldn't trade it at all. I work with a great staff.
good,Live Nation is a great company. One of the largest entertainment companies in the business and runs their venues with precision and professional.
good,"Working for Live Nation / House of Blues providing me with a wealth of knowledge that I will always be thankful for.  This was the first extremely large corporation I've worked for, and in many way that opened my eyes to many areas of business I never imagined.  Working through so much red tape provided its challenges in some way, but once I learned how to navigate through that world, it proved to be very efficient.  "
good,Great work environment and a great place to work if you have a passion for music and concerts
good,"- good working environment"
good,Everyone here seems to know exactly what there doing and if you don't no one minds filling you in on anything.
good,"I feel like a valuable member of the Usher team at the Jones Beach venue. I love the employees, the management makes me feel appreciated, and I get paid to be at the biggest concerts of the Summer. Pay is not too good, but I love the job. It's like having a glorified camp counselor job - you don't do it all for the cash, mostly the experience. I hope to find a full-time position with this company one day!"
good,"20,000+ people,outdoors,and live music from some of the top artists in the industry. I polished & improved some of my customer service skills. The management staff is extremely supportive. I had the pleasure of working with a diverse group of individuals who also believe in teamwork. The most difficult part of this job is some of the physical demands. The best part of this job is being with thousands of people, outside, and sharing our passion for music."
good,"If you like music and being outside, this is a good seasonal job. My only issue is the favoritisms. The same people are getting the “better” locations/jobs and I doubt that will change, even though they claim it’s not happening. I have some coworkers that make the job way more fun!!"
good,"Easy and flexible employment opportunity.  Teamwork atmosphere.  Company stresses their concern for recycling, this evident in our clean-up process prior to shutting down for the day."
good,The pay is not so great since you only work when there’s a concert but other than that you make a lot of friends as co-workers and meet a bunch of different people every concert!
good,"Working with live nation has been a real pleasure. The people I work with are like family to me. Everybody gets along and gets the job done. My manager makes sure to take care of me and make sure I have food, water and sunscreen."
good,I loved interacting with the customers and participating in different concert events. Management always tries to show appreciation to staff with free lunches and sometimes tickets to shows which is awesome. The environment is generally packed and can be overwhelming but fun overall.
good,I love Live Nation they are doing great things involving workers to make the venue more aware of recycling.  This venue is one that I have grown to love and the crowd that comes is worth the day you come into work.  The staff is excellent and welcoming and you get to experience how a show is put together while learning other aspects of this job.  Even though it is for the summer I have had a great time meeting all the staff and guests are wonderful.  Being from Jersey I have to say the atmosphere is so different that I do not miss the North at all.
good,Fun place to work and to learn more about Security issues.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Live Nation, mostly because at all times i felt as if i was a part of something bigger than me, bigger than anything i had ever experienced prior. It taught me to work under a pressure i had not experienced before and how to remain calm and collected in the face of said pressure. "
good,I enjoyed taking care of the guests that had come to watch the concert. I was in charge of the VIP seating area along with all other sections in the Amphitheater. Making sure every guest had the experience they came to expect at a LIve Nation Show.
good,In this industry the days are always long. It can be competitive. You can make great connections. You will be part of a industry that very little people will ever get to see.
good,fun place to work within a fast paced environment. Meet all kinds of different people and good chances to progress. Good management team and lots of support
good,"As a Local VIP Assistant you are responsible for making sure that customer get the best possible experience from their VIP Package purchase. This may be from receiving their gift bags/swag bags, to their cocktail hours, or artists meet & greets. The daily tasks are typically tedious and very fast pace with extreme attention to detail needed; but after the work is over you are able to watch the concerts. Everyone that works for Live Nation has been extremely welcoming and professional. I would highly recommend working with them."
good,Mainly work at one venue but there are opportunities to work at multiple venues. There are various positions that can be assigned and each has its own set of responsibilities so one can have a different work experience each time. Fun atmosphere to work at.
good,"•	In charge of managing clients participating in our VIP program.				"
good,Working with Live Nation has provided me with ample experience to further my career. They constantly ensure that their workers are well-rounded and will give their employees different tasks accordingly.
good,A typical day at work consits of adaptability and flexability listening to a set of instructions and being able to excute commands. You experience new things everyday you are at work due to the different types of enviorments.
good,"Great place to work yet it was seasonal, made great lifelong friends and I will probably stay seasonal yet look for something full-time. I would recommend if you are looking for fun part time that you look no further."
good,I took care of customers at the ticketing windows on show nights. I learned how to use the Ticketmaster system and work with all types of customers. Management was right next to you at all times so you were never in a bad situation. My co-workers were great. The hardest part of the job was there weren't enough hours but I really enjoyed my time there and given the opportunity I would definitely go back.
good,"Working at Live Nation is a blast! You get paid to listen to great concerts and the work isn't too hard either. You still have to do your job you can't just sit around and listen to music, but it is one of the best jobs I've ever had. I loved being both security and an usher."
good,A typical day at work includes bartending different kinds of events at the House of Blue (CLEV). I have learned a lot about diversity. Not only people but music and management styles as well. Management always has an open door policy and will work with youand around other schedules if requested. My co-workers are friendly. The hardest part of my day would be the late hours and the physical strain. The most enjoyable part of my job is the workplae being a different atmsophere every time I go in. Serving and getting to know a new group of customers as the different events come in.
good,"The weekdays were spent in the office, doing invoices and researching potential customers, marketing and outreach to customers. The weekends were spent working live events, promoting VIP packages and offering upgrades to non VIP ticket holders."
good,When I get to the sight of the event I immediately check in and ask whoever the manager in charge if they need anything done. Until then I stay close by with my phone if I am needed at anytime to make a run out to pick up something.
good,Coney Island Ford Amphitheater is apart of Live Nation. That's where I worked. Great summer job. Great concerts outdoors in a tent. Fun Managers. Hope I get the opportunity to work there again. Wish it was an all year round facility.
good,"If you like working around live outdoor entertainment this is for you. You're also exposed to the elements of the season, so bring rain gear, and refreshments."
good,It is a great place to learn and grow internally. This is not the place to be recognized for your talents and asked to move up. They hire many outsiders and that lowers employee morale and that lowers the quality of the job performance from your team.
good,"Management is far."
good,This is an overall great company to work for. The perks are great and the culture is very laid back but focused. I really enjoyed my time there and would definitely recommend.
good,"Although at times hours are looking, overall this company is totally hands on including upper management. Friendly, interactive team players. Great bunch of co workers and you feel very protective when working out in the field! I loved the sense of welcoming and confidence i felt when i worked with my crew here!! Great people!"
good,"I work parking and so far it is pretty fin. Only complaint is that we get one 15 minute break for about 9 hours of work and we don't really get to sit down. The work schedule also isn't something that is consistent, so it's more of a hobby than a job."
good,It was a great job as far as work goes but the pay was not good for the work i had to do . i enjoyed the job overall because the experience of getting to enjoy the concerts for a little bit from time to time . the only thing i didnt like about the job was the pay .
good,"Enjoyed the banter between both colleagues and customers, not to mention every night you got to experience live music. Though you did occasionally have to deal with drunk and disorderly customers."
good,"Been working a lot Nation for three years of operations supervisor organizing dressing rooms to dealing with 5,000 seats in and out of a pit during my time I was briefly manager while supervising large-scale painting job I ran the water stations at Central Park for a concert... Intel's over 30 employees spread out all over the park and have the Monitor and watch"
good,"Nice atmosphere, get to attend all events, but only work when there is an event . Not a good main source of income. Everyone is very friendly and helpful. Customer service is the main part of most positions available , so being comfortable interacting with guests & answering questions is very important:"
good,"We had meetings before we worked our shift. Everyone knew what they were going to do, if you weren't quite sure there was always some there to show you. Great team players at the venue I worked."
good,Great environment to work in. Great people to work beside daily. Benefits are great. The things the learn aside from your occupation is vast. The connections your make can boost you farther in life for sure.
good,"At the Wiltern Theater I sell upgraded experiences to guests, such as, purchasing tables, upgrading seats, and offering party packages. I was the top seller my first night on the job and I continue to exceed management’s financial and guest satisfaction goals every show night. This job requires flawless communication skills from FOH to BOH production."
good,"I work for live nation for Fun I work in the office area and rear gate until security comes in for the concert. It is just a fun place to work You can hear the concerts and get paid for it. Typically, I handed out shirts collected dirty shirts washed and folded shirts, I checked in all employees and made sure they had the equipment that they needed for the concert. Working the Gate make sure staff is the only people coming into the venue until Security arrived to check in concert goers,"
good,I love all of the people that I work with. The company is small and close-nit. I feel valued and encouraged every day. I love live music and get to work doing what I love in an exciting and ever-changing environment every day.
good,"While working with their booking department, it was very hands on and they give you responsible projects to do. The most enjoyable part was how laid back the work environment was. Nothing was ever rushed when an intern."
good,Can't wait for the next season...  This is my 5th season and many continue to return after more than 10 and 15 years. Great atmosphere to make friends and meet new people. A plus is being in the area for the shows while maintaining patron safety.
good,Great place to work! Excellent boss with great communication.  Seeing or hearing concerts while helping make guest experiences great is a plus. Flexible with scheduling needs.
good,"The pay is minimal or average for a joe job but fun. You get to see a concert for free and getting paid to do it! Some people do get out of hand by trying to sneak in some areas that they didnt pay for so you have to have them escorted out of concert or area. Your an usher so your main job is to help patrons find their seats, keep the safety of the patrons and yourself, assist in any way possible to keep peace and be a problem solver in any case. People come to concerts to have fun, so some people will drink too much while others just want to see their favorite bands."
good,"Only scheduled to work on concert dates. Come in and sign in your name and time you arrived. Before going to assign people where to park we would meet and get assigned a parking lot to work for the evening. Although the parking lots were named by letters they were enormous. After the meeting report to your assigned parking lot to park cars for the concert. We would be given highlight green vest and flashers for when the day breaks to be seen. If at any point your parking lot becomes full, you maybe assigned to go and assist other employees with another parking lot. We would usually finish parking the last cars around 830 9. Our break is taken after this point, which is about 2 hrs or at least until the concert is over. Overtime was called E-Gress. It was optional if you wanted to do E-gress you would report back to work after your break to help the exit flow of cars after the concert. If not you would sign out after the break is over and go home."
good,"A great place to work, depending on what you do. I worked as a customer service associate, and go to meet a lot of interesting people and during breaks I got to enjoy great music at the venue. "
good,Legends is a fun environment to work in. They are happy to teach you and give opportunities to lead. I have enjoyed my time with them and hope to continue.
good,"Fast paced environment where behind the scenes work makes large performances come to fruition. Working alongside with professional tour crews and local stagehand crews in a stimulating setting. As long as employees are early for their clock-ins, there are no problems. Management is fun and interesting, but know when to be serious in order to keep things moving."
good,The season requires a lot of hard work but management is organized and supportive.  Co-workers help each other with tasks.
good,"I have been working with this company for three years. In that time I have met and worked with a lot of good people here. This is not a company I would recommend if you are searching for a life time career. Not in the area I work anyway. That being said, it is a great place to work. Management is always considerate and helpful. They always take care of any issues in a timely fashion. I look forward to working here for a long time."
good,often quite unconvenient working conditions because of the nature of the job but management did their best to return the favour by giving away free concert tickets
good,Everyone who worked here was passionate about their job and about music. Not only were they hard workers but they also knew how to have fun.
good,"Great benefits, great company. Very hard work, but very rewarding. Very long days during concert season, but well worth the hard work!"
good,"A typical day would consist of re-scheduling meetings, booking travel for my Executives, ordering lunch for a meeting, and submitting an expense report for my Executives. No day is the same. It's a fast paced environment and I thrive in that type of workplace."

good,"I worked in the sponsorship sales and coordination department for Live Nation at the MIDFLORIDA Credit Union Amphitheater. I cannot be more enthusiastic about the experiences that I had at this internship. I learned a great deal about prospecting for potential sponsors, and was able to assist in marketing responsibilities as well. Another project i am proud of is planning all aspects of the upcoming Live Nation Campus Road Trip. I also learned how the live entertainment business is structured, and what it takes to be successful in this field."

good,Live Nation is a great environment to work in. great people to be around. I just need more money and I'm looking for a barback job that's available. If they had one available for Live Nation where I'm working . I would be more than happy to take that position. I'm seeking to better my career and barbacking seems to be one of my favorites
good,If you have never worked or you need a second job that will not interfere with your other job definitely join. It is seasonal so expect to work from end of May to maybe beginning of October. The events are posted ahead of time so you can plan ahead and the management is great and they are really nice. It is a easy job so the pay in a way is reasonable but it would be nice if they raised it a bit. When you have a friend or family or anyone join with you or you refer someone and hey work even one show you get paid a good sum.
good,"Live Nation is a great place to work. I started working here in March and I've loved it since the first day. All of management is really nice and laid back, but not too laid back. Lawn chairs is the perfect job for me because its pretty easy, but it can get very hard at the end of the night. I just wish there was a kind of meal plan every show for employees, because its really wishy washy. A pretzel and a drink per show would be great."
good,"A diverse workplace with great benefits and interesting industry. As much as I enjoyed working at Live Nation, the travel can be taxing. I enjoyed my colleague's company. A very forward thinking company with a CEO that legitimately cares for his employees and has implemented programs throughout the nation that reinforce his beliefs."
good,DOPE! I liked it was a good experience. Got a chance to be more outgoing and helping people. Also experience what it's like to be on the other side of attending a concert.

good,A day at Live nation could be compared to a make a wish foundation because of how enjoyable the workplace and fun the people are.  I learned how to communicate even better with visitors as well as management.  I think the hardest part of the job would be the crazy fans but in the same sense they made the job worth while.
good,"This opportunity to learn in an environment like this was extremely beneficial for my career; management did a great job making me feel comfortable asking questions and getting the chance to make mistakes on my own"
good,Everyone is super fun and up-beat but they know when it's time to get to work. We had staff parties throughout the concert season and the managers were great to work with.

good,"For a normal day as concert security with Live Nation, I start with watching the upper gates to the venue from 10 A.M. until 3:30 P.M. when the parking lots open up for patrons. From then until the concert is over, we, the lot security crew, then move down to walk around the lots and report any patrons in need of assistance, assist the police in fight calls, and just act as crowd control. The lot management is really good with making sure we get any help we need. The most enjoyable part is also the hardest. We deal with all different types of people all day, so this job has really helped me to interact with and read people to make a better experience for the patrons and myself."
good,I have been working at Walnut Creek in Raleigh for 4 years we only work during the summer. It's a fun place get to see the concerts and sometimes meet the artists.
good,"I love working here!  The base pay is not as high as some other call centers, but the benefits more than make up for it.  I only wish they weren't closing our call center to combine with one in another state."
good,I like working with all my co-workers. I have learned its a lot out there in the world to also stay focus. The hardest part is the sun it can be really hot out there.

good,Great company if you like live music. Very relaxed environment and everyone is happy to come to work. Organization may need to be fix a bit but manageable if your up for it. Concert attendance sometimes required for some positions.

good,"I had two incredible Summer concert seasons working as a Stagehand with Live Nation. I had an amazing group of people to work with that taught me the ins and outs of stage production.

good,"Great job and great environment. If you love what you do, it is not a job. Management top down was very organized and plans well."

good,Fast and stressful but fun as you get to have many concerts and get paid to have fun as well as work it gets hot and you get to be the fuzz so much fun wish there were more shows and the season went on longer then it does as well as better compensation for the risk we take in the more aggressive shows I love this job
good,Its fumes working at the amphitheater.  If your up to working long periods you can.  No one forces you to work long shifts. Everyone works together to get the job done.
good,LiveNation employees are very friendly and energetic.  The venues are very easily accessible for attendees with disabilities as well.  Especially the outdoor venues.

good,"I enjoyed working for Live Nation World Wide, however I came into some personal issues in my life that made my attendance bad after working for 4 years with the company. I am ready to move on and be an asset to another company. I work hard and take great pride in my work."
good,"No I don't get free or discounted tickets. No I don't get to go backstage and meet the bands. However, I do get paid to listen to over 40 concerts every summer. The job has allowed me to learn so many things about efficiency, customer service, and handling issues in high pressure situations. I highly recommend this job to any 18 year old looking for a summer job."
good,"Had an amazing summer with great co-workers. Made good pay (got a raise though because I was working hard). One thing to be said is that if you don't like the heat and humidity, this is NOT the job for you. Many long hours in the sun, customers can vary depending on the concert. Sometimes you get good people that just tailgate and leave with no problems. Other times there's people who hate to be told no and cause a fuss. But the job is worth it as its just a summer job."
good,Great energy and people on a day to day work environment. You can bring your kids and dogs to work. Fun place.
good,"Exciting place to work with great energy, and varied levels of entertainment.  From the restaurant downstairs, to the music hall with live bands, to the private members Foundation Room, there was always something for anyone.  I enjoyed the experience of dealing with such a diverse gather of people, from the bands, to the customers, to all the employees."
good,"Working for the company is all about protecting the fun, having over 500 employees to work with. All the workers are helping to keep the venue safe and fun for all. I learned how to handle people who try and cause problems and pick fights, as well as catch people who try and sneak in. It's also about keeping the people safe, who are partying too hard. Management does a very good job, telling employees where to work, what sections of the venue to work and how to help guests. Co- Workers usually do the same thing I would do, answering questions, checking bags, and security. The hardest part of the job is dealing with drunk people who want to try and fight you, or getting help to the people who are really injured. The most enjoyable part of the job is watching people having a good time, because you know you're doing your job by keeping a safe environment."
good,I've been with live nation for a little over four years. although it is only seasonal I love every time I get to work. you meet people from all over the country.

good,Being a ticket taker you have to smile and welcoming the customers. I learn to make sure the ticket that the customer is holding is correct when I'm done scanning them.The hardest part about this job is smiling as long as you can. The easy part about this job is scanning tickets and welcoming them in the concert.
good,"Being a round a whole crowd over 6,000 people at a time is a little bit overwhelming but you meet so much nice people. The loud music. The food trucks and there food veriteys are awesome."

good,great company to work for if someone wants to stay busy and enjoy their job. The hardest part of the job would have to be the constant commotion. the most enjoyable would have to be being able to work with a lot of different people
good,"A typical day at work her consists of escorting customers to their seats, making sure that everyone is safe at all times, as well as escorting individuals out of the facility as needed."

good,"Many opportunities available around the world and unlimited potential growth as long as your flexible.  Management is fair and goes above and beyond for the employees and more importantly, the guest.

Make sure we catch any weapons people might try and get in the door with them. Its not easy figuring out peoples body language.
good,"Working site ops was a challenge as I learned more about heavy machinery and operation than I had previously been exposed to. Everyone is an integral piece of the operation and every person on the team does their part.  The management is top notch and well versed in their positions.  I love the festival atmosphere when the event is ongoing, there is no energy in the world quite like it.  Working with the entertainment department with performers and actors is my greatest passion as if living a dream.  It is all encompassing work in being aware in such a distracting atmosphere but the experience you create for concert goers is incomparable."

There can be a hundred people in the room. You might have to be scanning tickets and answering questions about the venue right before you have to escort a huge group of people and then come back and clean up tables and make sure the food is refilled.

good,a tpical day at work for me would be very busy loud and crowded having a deal with all kinds of different people at the concert place and helping them with everything .
good,Live Nation is a good summer job for college students or high school students. It allows you to work outside in the concert venue and teaches young people the value of a dollar.

As a guest services representative, I get to meet diverse people during every show and do what I love, enjoying music of all genres live.

I plan to be part of this company until I retire. Benefits are great for full-time employees"

The 20+ hour shifts, operating and transporting heavy equipment, coordinating thousands of people and vehicles, and providing emergency response with only 45 minutes of break every 8 hours, although extremely difficult, taught me discipline and pushed me to my fullest potential. Another great aspect of this job was my experience in learning to cooperate with others, where efficacious teamwork was imperative to the job."
