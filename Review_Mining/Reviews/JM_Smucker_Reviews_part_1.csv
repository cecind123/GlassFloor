rating,review
bad,I am just typing here to fill the characters and nothing more. The company provided free lunch during Christmas time to the employees who were hungry.
bad,People were great! Management is ruining the company. They preach values but they have none! Miss the people I worked with everyday. Management has no clue! Worst place I have ever worked. No family values anymore....
bad,Corporate needs a new management at this facility. Temperatures either 100 or almost freezing. Pay is minimal for what you do and temperatures you have to endure. Health insurance is a joke.
bad,"Unwilling to listen to what the day to day challenges are."
bad,I was being harrassed at work and i was the one who go in trouble. Bad hr and supervisors. They dont care about there employees at all. Dont work there
bad,Im looking for a career to build me as a person . This job is just a job nothing more. They have alot of overtime available mon through sat case pickers loaders and outbound.
bad,"This place is known negatively to locals.  Local job market is dismal, they know it.  First phrases muttered when I told people I was hired, ""Oh wow...I'm sorry.  You'll be living there.""  Most hostile work environment I've ever encountered.  Treated with prison like enforcement.  Supervisor manipulated score tracking system.  Union tends to favor company.  Incompetent, under qualified management.  Favoritism towards Good Ol' Boys.  The overtime is relentless, 70+ hours a week.  The amount of overtime affects the safety of forklift drivers.  Rather pay overtime then hire or have enough employees per shift business model.  All over time is mandatory.  I've worked a couple months without a day off.  The way the overtime works pins employee vs employee daily.  The ""who can get out of overtime,"" game.  The pay is high, it has to be, no one would do it for less.  I would seriously stay away, unless you have accrued some massive amount of debt and absolutely need to live at work."
bad,Do not work at the Decatur plant in the warehouse unless you enjoy cleaning up after other people constantly and being talked to like a child and yelled at by coworkers. Also you will be overwhelmed by the unfair work load put on one person at the Decatur plant.
bad,"inspecting my forklift before driving it and  Staging pallets in the bay. "
bad,"Place went down hill starting around 2007. The best part of the day was going home. I learned people don't matter. A worker is just another number. Pay was good. We were often told that if we worked very hard and got ahead, we wouldn't have to work Saturday. Then we'd get ahead and they would just add more batches. Cut corners all the time. Office people would walk through the plant and tell workers how to do their jobs."
bad,They treat their workers like badly. The other employees look down on any new people. They spread rumors about everyone. They lose people faster than they can hire them.
bad,"Awful management that lies to your face and does not actually solve problems, workers are unhappy across all 3 shifts, no sense of accomplishment, outdated equipment, always behind schedule, company is mismanaged from the top down (another pet food recall and falling stock prices), etc."
bad,"Terrible terrible company. Outright lies to it's employees, took a plant that was in business for 40+ years and effectively ran it into the ground in 2 years. Human resources will lie at every chance, they pick and choose who they want in a position, not who is qualified for the job or who rightfully won the bid. Backdoor shady practices and an elitist mentality makes this an awful company to work for. There is no training for positions or education available. Machine operators are expected to learn tasks with only a few hours actually performing their job before they are pulled to other positions to fill in for shortages. Expect to live at work because while they say ""some overtime"" it really means every weekend and being forced for overtime every day since they eliminated 1/4 of the workforce and refuse to fill open positions. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."
bad,I enjoyed operating the capping machine. I also worked as a assistant Kettleman when ever required. Prepared boxes to be put on pallets for shipping and receiving.
bad,I would not recommend this company employees that worked there for 15 plus years were let go they expected you to learn stuff that you didn’t need to know or didn’t pertain to your job
bad,When you sign on to become an employee at Smuckers you are signing your life away. You will have work life balance. Be prepared to work 60-80 hours a week. We are currently working a month straight as we speak. We run out of ingredients though we work every weekend. When you first start you'll be the lowest on the totem pole so be prepared to work 12 hours a day every day. If you don't have a life this place is great but you will barely see your family.
bad,"Management has run the place into the ground. Starting at about the year 2007, every year thereafter got worse. Workers are treated like just another number. Many still stay only for the money and vacations. If the pay was much less, they'd have to close the doors. About the only good thing about the place is that they don't care what gender you are. Rules seemed to change by the week. Morale on a scale from one to ten is a big zero. The plant can't go more than a day or two without something going wrong. The plant layout is a joke. Not safe. Many of the workers are very fine people. As time goes by, more are leaving for less pay and much better treatment. Smuckers is not a family company anymore, and that's very sad."
bad,"The pay is good.  The hours are long.  Management does not seem to be concerned about family life.  They conducted a buyout, then immediatlely had to hire because they eliminated too many positions.  Many people work overtime from week to week."
bad,stay away from this place at all cost... way to much politics to contend with from top of the corporation to the bottom of the  ladder...advancement is based on p.c. and not on merit...quitting that job was the best thing that i have ever done...
bad,"They knew when they hired me I would be laid off in 2 months due to Smuckers taking over. They knew I had a family to provide for and still hired me and neglected to say anything,  until the day of.  No notice or anything. It's been 2 months and my family is still trying to recover. Honestly, Americold is hiring and I make 3 grand a month there. Just go apply there."
bad,"hot in the summer and cold in the winter inside of the building, good pay but too much overtime, no family life once you begin working for this company. never told of what is going on in the company and or get told one thing and they do another and just leave a person hanging. never any updates of what is going to happen for the employee just updates on good happening for their company. they say they are family oriented and yes they are but only with their family. if you don't see your family because of all the overtime that is not important to them."
bad,"I worked with a manager who had unethical practices.  But he wasn't fired when management found out.  He was only moved to a different area.  Workplace drama and back stabbing if you're not ""in the click "".  They only advance people with degrees  and treat the true workers as second rate citizens.   Good pay if your there long enough."
bad,"Not worth the 14.50 ph to put up with management. Chaotic, fast paced, and no matter how hard you work its not good enough tjey always want more. 12 hour shifts rotating."
bad,"no advancement unless you were ""in the group"".  Silly Step up cards that took forever for you to complete to even get a small wage increase.  Hot, wet environment.  Poor management.  Not a place I would work at again."
bad,"This job has a lot of priveleged employees and a class full of not so privileged,very noticeable plus side about it for my job is I didn't have to work around a lot of people and the people I did work around I liked very much."
bad,I worked as a temp service representative at this job and management didn't treat my peers and I great at all.
bad,Working in a factory everyday in humid conditions was the only factor due to my asthma
bad,Smuckers wants extraordinary productivity. I had a very poor manager on a very poorly managed packaging shift. Lack of integrity. Lack of honesty. Very poor behaviors for a manager.
bad,"The management at the JM Smucker company is horrible.  They do not work with you to grow and advance your career, but criticize and demean people (borderline harassment).  Located in the middle of nowhere, Ohio, there is NOTHING near it - no city life, no activities, so hard to attract good talent!  JMS doesn't encourage new idea or forward thinking, it's their ""basic beliefs"" interpreted their way, or it's the highway."
bad,"When i hired in things were great, had HMO, really good match on 401k to contributions, had more holiday time off/ more flexible holiday time off, use to have sick days paid, use to have a 7 day shift premium of .70 cents per hour, the Culture use to be really inviting and family oriented, now they are cutting benefits, time off, wages and employee moral"
bad,"Management has no clue.   Over worked and underpaid.  Treated like prisoner;  tool box searches, no family time (especially on 3rd shift), chain link fence with barbed wire inward,  constantly lied to, and disrespected daily.  Supervisors with no understanding of their actual job or the employees they oversee.  Pay rates are disrespectful to maintenance personnel.   Have to call in sick to get a day off.  People that do nothing are awarded while those that work hard are expected to work even harder.  All in all, it sucks to work here."
bad,"The Smuckers in Longmont is different from the rest. I would recommend other Smuckers plants but if this one is to be the new norm then Smuckers is not what it once was. Skilled trades are the same as production, everyone does everything and schooling is seen as far more valuable than actual work experience. There is room for growth if you play the game by their rules. Rotating shifts."
bad,The only thing good about this place are the people and when I say people I mean the technicians. Management is a joke. You work anywhere from 2-4 Saturdays a month from April til October. Good workers get passed over for promotions often. Do not recommend.
bad,its just a boreding job all you do is stand for 12hrs and look at bread all day for 12hr break r to short and lunch some time the have foor there for you.
bad,"The company talks big about culture and values and that ""may be true"" for those who work in Orrville, however those who work in the field have a much different picture of the company."
bad,"Paul Smucker always said he would never lay off a single employee....when he passed it all went out the window. The boys decided to shut down operations west of the Mississippi.  Effectively wiping out 150+ jobs at our plant alone. Many of us were 2nd generation employees, my father had 35 yrs in and my wife and I had 15 each.  Our severance for 15 yrs was 3300.00."
bad,Working in the cook room you weigh batches of fruit.I drove forklift and brought ingredients to the cook room. Dumped ingredients into kettles and weighed out sugar.
bad,A decent place to start and gain experience but beyond that it doesn't extend further. But if you have a degree and plan on committing your life there then you can have a career
bad,"The company needs to do more research and improvement on management. Just beacuse they work for the company, promotions need to be given to work performance and integrity of the company, not because of ""WHO YOU KNOW""!!! The gossipying among acssociates and managers is like a high school...inappropriate conduct between management and workers is unreal.I hope this company cleans up the way actions of there workers perform there job duties.Its some real underline behaviors going on,but hey have turned there backs to some REAL ISSUES that will co tinue to affect this company."
bad,The culture is not very professional and there is a lot of socializing going on.  The products are o.k. and the processes are o.k. Not many opportunities.
bad,"I don't understand the people on here saying Smuckers has good benefits. Since when is a $6000 deductible with a health insurance company that doesn't want to pay anything considered good benefits? Once you top out your salary, that's it. No more raises, except the measley yearly raises of .03%. What a joke. Upper mgt is always poor mouthing and making cut backs. They constantly take away and never give back."
bad,A place I chose to leave after more than fifteen years of service because of the direction and approach management has taken toward employees.  Would not return to this company.
bad,"To many hours working ,12hrs,and weekends . To big of a turn over ,and not hiring people ,leaving production short handed ."
bad,"This company is run by several well meaning family members, but have grown so large they have people in management with no morals or ethics. They have questionable practices that will jeopardize the future of this company if left unchecked."
bad,"The job was ok at first, but then they were making a lot of changes,due to new management. I thought a lot of the changes were a little bit to much, one of the main changes were attendance policy, that has changed drastically, from 10 occurrence to 5, which it made it hard for employees to stay with in policy,. The company was really great in helping out with community, such as non profit organizations, ect."
bad,long hours and very demanding putting a lot on the operators with little time to get it done in a proper time frame. they do have a high standard for quality.
bad,"Nothing like walking in and being told you no longer have a job. Well that's they did to a bunch of us! Been knowledge since July,  but didn't notify the workers until the day of lay offs. So much for being family oriented."
bad,"My computer for some reason would not shade in five stars for overall rating, but that's what I would give it. Numerous ways to advance. Functional Leadership, ( I was Education and Training Leader). Equipment Expert, System Ownership was just some of the areas for advancement. Constantly learning. 100% employee involvement. Good place. Worked 12 hr shifts. Management interacted with employees on the floor. New everyone by name,."
good,There are long working hours at the Smuckers plant in Memphis TN.  They have an HSA Health plan that is garbage.  You have to pay a High out of pocket expense for the Health Care Plan.  They have a High Turn over rate of employment.  People are constantly getting fired on a weekly basis.
good,"Management does not care about employee advancement, just the ""bottom line"". Other departments may be better, the Call Center was the worst to be in. Several employees, including myself, had to work multiple jobs since the pay was inadequate. Management did not fight for employees. Very disheartening."
good,"The company's way of doing business it just too conservative.  They won't take action and will let a business sink, disregarding all recos, instead of taking action."
good,"fun and boring sometimes alot of learning abilities I learned forklifts,processing of juice making from processing all the way down to shipping every interesting"
good,"my typical day could range from working at one end of the plant to the other. I learned how to work on machines. management didn't seem to have it all together all the time. I had good co workers. the hardest part of the day was 12 hr shifts, the most enjoyable was days off"
good,I'd rather not comment in that I am currently working a process around my dismissal. A typical day was one filled with anxiety as to whether or not you were working in the areas desired. I learned that Smucker probably leads the world in PC criteria to the point of over functioning and knee-jerking along with double standards. The management seems to make rules on-the-fly. The culture is one where most people seem to be disgruntled and feel like a number. Smucker tries to have meals and appreciation type functions but they're not received with appreciation and it's due to the way people are treated. Smucker touts being for the family but that only applies to the consumer market.
good,"shallow superficial sweatshop, a young culture, too many meetings, too much bureaucracy, tries to create a family culture, everyone seemed miserable and exhausted, very stressful, lots of pressure, not like a family at all or maybe a dysfunctional one"
good,Its sad when youre working a job and new management comes in and change things. When a company replace more then half of the staff something is wrong. I really enjoyed the job but not so much the managers
good,"managed production line and cleaning of the entire plant"
good,"A lot of fun things to do, but not enough time to get actual work done. Had to pick up a lot of slack from others and severe lack of communication, etc."
good,"Ability to work around good people but management doesn't follow company beliefs.Too much favoritism amongst people and onboarding is a slow process.Also,too much assigned overtime when short staffed."
good,"At this job, I gained a lot of skills in mechanics. I am now a sound operator, mechanic, and manager of priorities. I was impressed with the way that this company trains its individuals. Most jobs here can be picked up rather quickly, if you have the dedication. The worst part of a manufacturing job such as this one, is managing your time between work, and your family, as all technicians will work twelve hour shifts, switching from days and nights."
good,"Hands on experience on food quality , safety ,GMP, Monitoring of CCP's  and analytical skills. Opportunity to improve communication and  technical skills"
good,"Good place to work with fun and recognizable brands. Very difficult projects and a lot of responsibility. Located in the middle of nowhere, which is not fun if you are young."
good,"Its a good place to work if you are just starting a family. Advancement is hard to get. It is nice getting so many holidays and vacation time, but like everywhere insurance is not as great as it could be."
good,"Completing task at hand for they day. Some days are challenging trying to time manage and multitask. Management is pretty much hands off, as long as the work got done. Very much a laid back kind of atmosphere,  I was mainly responsible for my positions functions."
good,This company use to be great to work for until smuckers took over.. they took away the great benifits and replaced it with HSA accounts that cost us 6k out of pocket before they would cover anything health wise.
good,This place was seasonal for me and o enjoyed working there. Honestly it's okay not great not terrible. Its a good job to make money and a lot of over time.
good,"Smuckers used to be a great company to work for things have changed the last three years, management changed with the hire of a bunch of college educated idiots. they made things worse for the older employees with experience who know how and what wouldn't work and what would from years of employment there."
good,The company has gotten too big too fast. The company is promoting individuals to management positions without the skills needed to perform the duties.
good,"Good competitive wages, health care good, retirerment is so so, they keep taking away from it. The problem is they have became so big they have lost there core values that they pride themselves on, also let Procter & Gamble have 51% of the company since the buying of Folgers coffee"
good,"At the moment, there isn't much to discuss in regards to this company. There are some difficulties in regards to acquiring additional assistance, but the working environment and the people are pretty good."
good,Some good people. Fast Pace forever changing environment. Stay on top of the game make things happen packaging pet food product lots of overtime lots of demand
good,Even if you do your job manager push you to get rate if you can't they put you on probation than out the door management looks the other way for there buddy's
good,"Too much favoritism, discrimination, and backstabbing.  Management is incompetent.  Very stressful and hostile environment.  Supervisors ignore safety concerns if the culprit is a “good ol’ Boy”."
good,"A typical day at work was looking at a bunch of bread go by for 12 hours a day... i learned how to work well with others on a assembly line. Very important that everyone is there, or production did not go smoothly."
good,With the recent acquisition of a pet food brand and decision to relocate it to its HQ out of state.  There was lots of movement and changes occurring within the organization overall.  New unseasoned management and new employees made it difficult to maintain an uplifting corporate culture.
good,"Good place to work for and they promote from within,Had very good training for the job. Company store to shop at on certain days."
good,"fast paced how to be a team player good management ,good bunch of people to work with, the long hours. the heat in summer, the bonus."
good,Leadership practices which contributed to past successes are less seldom applied. The company is currently challenged gaps in alignment across the organization which translates into an ineffective use of both financial and human resources.
good,It's was OK just got bored standing in one spot for to long an it was way to cold for me an the drive was way to far for me an long long shifts  other then that it was OK
good,Great company to work for if you enjoy Northeast OH.  The culture is not unified because the company is divided up between the business units. People are very friendly but management is still trying to figure out the day to day.
good,I loved working at Smuckers. Great people. Great products. Good work environment. The company has good ethics and good environment overall. I enjoyed learning and growing at Smucker's
good,The Toledo Plant I'm working in is being sold. This was a good place to work and now has the feeling of unknowns and instability. It is time to move on.
good,"Work was never overly difficult, but the forced overtime had become impossible to deal with. Being told 15 minutes before quitting time that you are forced to work an extra four hours does not work for a single parent."
good,Overall it was a good company to work for. Was treated fairly also offered opportunities for advancement. I would recommend this company to others. That is if you don't mind late night work. Sometimes I wouldn't get off until 3:00 am
good,great pay and great people working there. The management team is not very understanding. the insurance is okay. like anywhere else you have good folks and bad
good,"The campus is welcoming and employees have have access to a gym, health center, daycare center and healthy cafeteria. All the amenities that make you feel welcome and valued."
good,"Fast paced work environment with very little training required. Large number of employees, which lead workers to feel under appreciated and/or not needed."
good,"Smucker's has a great work/life balance and fantastic compensation and benefits.  They promote an amazing workplace culture, and it is for people who fit the Smucker's mold."
good,Short term project helping out on their EDI application.  Very productive interactions with the customers getting setup.
good,"Family value company, enjoyed working at Smuckers.  Management was friendly and professional."
good,"Learned how to run a Pallet Jack at this job but due to not having a GED, I could not get hired on full time so I had to leave."
good,"Worked on the Heat Tunnel"
good,Great place to work. For my first warehouse job it was alot better than what i had expected.
good,Great place to work.  Nice campus and office space.  Great people.  Not close to metro area. On site work out facility. Casual work environment. Flexible work environment.
good,"Smucker's business plan and strategy has changed, which included the sale of the Toledo facility and the North American baking industry. Internship ended before everything was finalized so it will be interesting to see what happens."
good,"Mu direct manager was great, and the folks in SF were great to work with.  JMS had a different set of data access rules for contractors as employees, making it hard to do my job.  They also had a 3 month review policy, which makes it hard to plan longer projects and insure continuity."
good,Culture is good but not for everyone. They are fair  employer that tries to have good work place and culture. It can come across as rather cult like. When they acquire a company they do not treat the new employees as part of the family in all cases.
good,"Great pay for area.  A lot of technical knowledge will be gained.  An entrance exam is required for employment.  You work a 12 hour a day, 2-2-3 schedule, paid every two weeks, receive a bonus once per year, if available.  Work in one of three departments (Process, Packing, Shipping), on one of four shifts (A/B, C/D)"
good,"J.M. Smuckers, or Picks Pickles was just a summer employment. a guaranteed job with guaranteed pay. As long as you worked hard and didn't fool around. you job was secure. leaving little worry for a highschooler that wanted to make money."
good,Highly collaborative work culture which drives lots of meetings and slow decision making. Little empowerment and sense of urgency. Culture encourages cautious analysis prior to taking action. Also need more care and attention to planning ahead to communicate large scale organizational changes. HR team is small and building skills to manage more complex organization. Environment tends to be political and lacking in transparency. Hiring based on large intake of interns - who are generally bright and ambitious.  Frequent job rotations often result in inexperienced people holding roles which also slows progress.
good,"pros:job allowed me to move around a lot. I enjoyed the residents."
good,"I've learned many thing with smuckers and have had many opportunity's to broaden my knowledge for example packing, Machine operator, to supervisor. Management can work on taking care of the small people better, co workers are great. company over all isnt a bad company to work for."
good,"JMS has a great work life balance, offering summer hours and everyone heads home at 5pm. The culture is family based and retains an essense of care throughout."
good,Compensation was good for the time you spend at work. A very demanding job due to the amount of production for the product. Always in a fire fighting mode and problem solver for all the issues that was occurring. Good floor presence from the shop floor. Team work was the culture of the floor. The technicians on the floor work through a high performance work system.
good,"i was working with jm smucker company as a co -op for 4 month .was a good test  for me ."
good,"Like the work. The problem with this company is when management have a problem with you they set you up to get rid of you. Let say you are gay and someone from the management team disapproves of a gay life style, "" they will set you up to get rid of you."""
good,I really did enjoy my job with the Folger's Coffee company. The schedule allowed for a reasonable amount of flexibility in order to maintain a good family life. The pay and benefits were exceptional. The only downside was the fact that a decision was made to move the plant to New Orleans and this did not fit my personal lifestyle at the present time so I had to take leave of this company.
good,Great job but no team  to get the job done everyone is out for them self . No help with production nerds to get running. Not saying all of smucker are this way but in some areas
good,Very relaxed and easy going place to work the only issue i had was the hours and rotating shifts. Coworkers are nice for the most part and there is room for advancement.
good,"Organization is very pleasant place to work.  There are many meetings which sometimes interfere with the site mission.   Also, there are many leaders each giving a different direction."
good,All of the workers helped each other. They had a great training program.
good,"The workplace culture values work life balance and people. Overall a good company. Located in a small town in Ohio, the location is great for families."
good,J M Smucker's expected and demanded a lot from there sales team. While rewarding job was very demanding. Highly stressful to perform and grow business.
good,"Operating and maintaining food processing equipment to ensure proper manufacturing and customer requirements for bread making. This job taught me that large-scale food processing has a great deal of problems that may arise at any given moment. Due to the stress associated with this job, co-workers let this affect their attitude and actions. Coping with co-workers lack of respect for other individuals was most definitely the hardest part of the job. The start of shift meeting was the most enjoyable part of the job. This meeting allowed all the team members to communicate and inform others of any necessary concerns needed to be expressed."
good,"The first 10 years was a great work experience, however after significant acquisitions, the culture changed dramatically, and the pressure was on to work 24/7."
good,"Working in Housekeeping but got Outsourced, we all was shocked that it happened no warning sign. Was working for a contractor that only offers Affordable Act Insurance. This Insurance should not be an option for a fulltime worker. Its A Joke and Insulting to a hard worker trying to make a living to survive....."
good,"Stable, growing company consistently seeking to grow via acquisition of Top brands or growth segments.  Not necessarily great track record of growing organically."
good,"i have to work"
good,"They allowed me to work desired hours that work best for my lifestyle. I am always busy, which I like. Multiple tasks and systems to navigate through to complete daily tasks. Everyone is very friendly. I have learned a new system that relates to work I processed."
good,"As temp it is a good work place but their is no advancements ,the people are friendly and nice the schedule is great as well"
good,Changing roles is like changing companies. With every position came new territory and a varied team. It was a good place to work with good people that new change was always around the corner.
good,"we always start off with stretching. then its right to work. wich i enjoyed. how to opperate a dumper and other machinery at the warehouse, Management was always around to make sure that work was done properly. It was hard to hear but my coworkers were respectful. Those barrels were heavy when you had to pick one up off the floor.The paychecks kept my enterests."
good,"•	Primary trainer and operations setup leader during all warehouse management system implementations, both internal and external."
good,come in and run a wrapper and make sure looks good to go into the stores.
good,learned a lot about food services.Became certified in machine operator and a forklift operator.
good,Managed all aspects of running an office.  Heavy inbound customer service calls.  Manages WH & driver inventories
good,"Very strong culture with concept of ""Basic Beliefs"":"
good,"I love working for the smucker company. My day is filled with a joy of helping customers, and a wonderful bond with my coworkers. Unfortunately is only seasonal with chance to hire on , but unaware if it is going to work out."
good,I worked for Smuckers 20 years. I learned alot in the several positions I held. I made alot of good friends in the time I worked there.
good,"I loved working here, i made friends and i loved my coworkers, until a supervisor was mad at me because of a rumor and called my temp agency and got me fired."
good,"When working in the warehouse, it is important to be safe while also being very productive.  The company thrives on teamwork to get the daily business done and to be successful.."
good,"Good place to work , just was not my kinda of work style . I am used to working out side , not inside.  Smucker has great pay and great benefits  for scottsville ky. I will miss all my friends that I have met ., since I started there as well as the ones I already had ."
good,"Worked in the warehouse on 3rd shift, had a really great fun crew and it was a very easy job, loaded trucks w/ a forklift, stacked pallets as the came off production lines and ran the palletizer. As a female college student who's never worked in a factory it can be intimidating, but the people i worked with were really truly great people. my only complaint was they weren't able to let me stay on longer because I was taking time off of school to work and you cant stay in the internship program unless you're a student."
good,Typically workday is 9-12 hours depending on the time of month. Fast paced with cost cutting activities being main focus. Culture has went through a major change due to struggling top line sales and external pressures such as 3G in the food industry. Hardest part of the job is changing ways of doings things.
good,"Good balance of work and home life, great place to work if you don't mind staying put and not advancing in your career. Very good  benefits and overall great place to work considered that you don't mind staying put in current job role."
good,"I had fun at work and enjoyed helping people get their questions answered and problems handled.  I kept office supplies stocked in our mailroom, I helped people with creating presentations, I enrolled new employees in health plans, dental, vision and 401k.  I did new hire training and have searched for candidates as well.  I'm proficient in Microsoft Windows, Word, Excel, Powerpoint and Outlook.  I love helping people and helping them to solve their problems."
good,This job provides great hands on learning and has offered me great success at my current position. Training was provided nationally and has been state of the art. They place a great focus on team work. Every employee brings a fantastic background.
good,"You are on an honor system, you come to work and go home keeping track of your own time. You do your jobs and do it good and you do not hear anything from anyone. I generally do not see my supervisor for weeks at a time because I go to work and do my job."
good,"Very collaborative, opportunities to work on key project and prove yourself.  Management has undergone major change and therefore more changes are expected.  People are wonderful.  Very friendly, smart and helpful.  Opportunity to move between the business units"
good,"I’d love to be back there but I had to relocate and the commute was to long "
good,smuckers is a very fast pace place to work. I learned that you have to be very good at driving a forklift so you can keep up with the production at smuckers
good,"Overall, Smucker's is a great place to work. Great work/life balance and friendly cultural environment. There is a lack of diversity mostly do to the geographic location."
good,"Great place to work and learn the ropes of Brand Management. Positive and supportive, collarborative culture. Takes a while to advance in your career, but it's possible if you are patient. Can be stressful, very fast paced, and challenging to keep up with work load and expectations. Difficult work-life balance."
good,"A really cool place to get your foot in the door. Getting to try all of the products on a regular basis is awesome, and as long as you have a college degree, you can go far."
good,"Nice place to work, Most leadership was great. My direct managers were awesome. All 6 of them. The schedule was not that bad. I made a lot of friends that I consider family."
good,"Company is still a little bit stuck in their old fashioned ways.  Sometimes they preach new ways of thinking or a desire to be a leader in certain areas, but they do not practice."
good,"A good company to work for. Allows for a good work life balance. 12 holidays a year plus two weeks of paid vacation and an option for one week of unpaid vacation."
good,"The pet food side of this company has encouraged innovation and experimentation, but Smucker's is moving the pet division to Ohio, so the team and culture will probably change significantly."

good,This is a good place to work. Work environment is friendlily with good work/life balance.
good,Good place to work - overall the culture was good and co-workers were nice. HR is strong in the organization - had some good training during my tenure.
good,The J.M. Smucker Company is a great place to gain experience in the CPG industry. However if you want to continue to advance you will need to stay in Orrville OH and if you're not from the area that is a difficult thing to do.
good,Great culture to work in for new employees to build a skill set as you enter your career because the organization places a high value on learning in cross functional roles

good,"Overall, this is a very nice place to work.  I would recommend it to others.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the people that were there as it was a very positive environment.  I learned a lot about myself working there, and grew as a person."
good,A very clean and climate controlled work atmosphere. A 12 hour day or night shift that rotates. Not a bad place to work. The only mess that you may encounter is a little peanut butter or jelly so no worries on any tough stains on those blue jeans.

good,Operated and maintained filling and packing machines. Good mgrs. and excellent people to work for.
good,"I was given several projects in my 7-month co-op. The work included both Value-Engineering and Technology Platform Improvements. My work was 100% owned by me, but it was very easy to reach out to the full-time employees and pick their brains. Being in R&D, my work was not having a direct impact on the company, but I was getting to try and learn things no one else had ever done before."
good,Hard work and long hours.  Lots of travel because the position covered plants in different locations hundreds of miles apart as well as the Corporate office in Ohio.  The company was SEC stock market listed which introduced me to some new reporting requirements
good,"As a quality technician, I was busy every day working and collaborating with multiple people from multiple departments.  Even though it made for a very busy day, I really enjoyed my work at Smucker."
good,Great job if looking for a career. Long-term advancement is available if patient. I wanted to advance faster so that is why I am looking for another opportunity.
good,"As a Finance Intern at Smuckers, I had gained experience in accounting and finance. During this time, I was responsible for sorting through over five million dollars of freight and inventory entries on Excel. In addition, I had to track and analyse daily changes in commodity prices and present my findings to the team every month, encouraging a newfound fluidity in my communication methods. My efforts and progress were recognized by my manager and colleagues, my work was extended to include freight accruals, payments, the calculation of purchase price variance and accounting for the foreign exchange impact of international transactions."
good,This location was a facility that did multiple products fresh pack berries and other fruit products during the summer and other product formulations.  Days were busy with production but with a can do culture of its employees.  Management was experienced and competent and had a good team environment.   There were daily challenges to get all the raw product processed in a timely manner.  Working with a variety of individuals was rewarding here.
good,"Excellent company that truly lives and breathes its core values daily; those of Quality, People, Ethics, Growth, and Independence."
good,"Great place to work, lots of changes taking place with the rapid growth over the last few years.  Change is good just takes time to get everything in alignment."
good,There has been a tremendous amount of opportunity for advancement over the last 12 years.  Management is incredibly supportive.
good,I really liked working for them.  It was a home-based position so enjoyed the flexibility of managing my own travel and sales call schedules.  Hardest part of the job was the size of the territory.
good,"Run production by operating production line with team. Preform maintenance, and repairs when needed. Help with new equipment installs. change out parts and center lines for different size products. "
good,"Great job over all .. Job is physicially demanding.. Job keeps you on your toes , very laid back invironment.."
good,"Being a smaller person, this just wasn't the job for me. I was expected to move product on a much greater scale than what I had been told in my application and in the interview. But, I've you've got a good body and don't mind manual labor they're an amazing company. The coworkers were all great and I honestly felt like I was apart of a supportive team."
good,"The JM Smucker's company offers great benefits and for the most part leadership is fair. Working 12 hour shifts, on your feet during the entire shift is tough but the day/night work rotation is even tougher. Overall the workplace culture is very positive."
good,Smuckers is a good place to grow and make money. smuckers works a 12 hour shift and every other weekend off with days off through the week. smuckers makes dog and cat food.

good,I was very happy working there and enjoyed what I did and my co-workers.  It was unfortunate I developed the swine grease allergy or I would still be working there.
good,"Company trying to grow too fast and that is hurting the employees.  Hours have changed so many times that it's difficult to keep up.  Great place to work if you can keep up with what's going on. Go to work, do your job(and others that fall within your realm), get paid and go home.  Attendance is a very big part, as with any job, just be at work in time because when you call out that just hurts everyone else."
good,"This is a great company to work for and the facility has been here for years. It has provided for my family for years and will continue to provide for us both in hourly pay and benefits. They always have jobs open that you can learn and make more money. You will work long hours but most of it is due to co workers not showing up to work so you have to continue to cover for them. Issue at the facility is co-workers and lack of work ethic. Many want to come to work do nothing and get paid, pay is great for area. They make mistakes and find ways to blame on us that do our job correctly or blame management since they cant follow directions."
good,"At Smuckers i knew in advance they were shutting the facilities down in a few years. good compensation employee relations. They were a great company to work for, good training and professional."

good,Smuckers was very flexible. My hours were not so long but I was glad I was making peanut butter and jelly with my co-workers. The most enjoyable part was that we had rotations. Sometimes we had packaging.

good,"I am happy to work for Smucker Company. I have worked with many good employees, good managers. We work like a team. This company has a good work environment, and a  good benefit as well."
good,People are very nice and helpful.  Work Life balance is excellent.  The headquarters in Orrville (OH) have a nice cafeteria and a gym.  Good entry-level opportunity to start a career.
good,A typical work day would be running machines and ensuring quality product is being manufactured. Very laid back and friendly environment to work in.
good,my review would be great place to work I thing I liked about the job was it was something that I never thought I would handle cause it was 8 hour shift but I would be standing all day and I enjoyed it. I like the challenge to know what are my weekness or my strenghs to. so I really enjoy different job positions.
good,"enjoyable place to work with friendly people and clean enviornment."

There are clearly defined cultural values and expectations management shares with employees to make sure everyone is being  a team player and a nice person to be around. After leaving this company for another opportunity I really miss this atmosphere.
good,"Founded on Basic Beliefs, this company strives to hold up the best standards for their products and company culture. It is a great place to work,especially in a growing industry, with strong family values and work ethic"
good,The workplace culture of our facility is probably the most enjoyable aspect of my job here. The entire department and management team  work well together and are supportive of one another.
good,"The company itself is great. However, I do not feel that this department is condusive to a successful environment. I am feeling emotionally drained and prepared for a change to serve people in a more face to face customer service position at this time."
good,A good company to work in. Many people didn't like the newer management. It was a safe place to work. The people were very friendly. They stressed safety over anything else.

good,A good place to work. Nice culture and people to work with.
good,I would come in and talk with the overlapping crew since we were a 24 hour facility. I would ask about any concerns or needs that may need to be met that day. I would check my email and my physical mailbox. Interactions with drivers and coworkers was almost immediate. I would check for outgoing shipments for the day and any other needs of the department.
good,I was proud to find a food production place to work. it is one of the best place i have worked in my job history. it is really worth the time you spend in clean place.
good,"I really enjoy working at Smucker's. They have a Summer Hours program which allows you to work a condensed week M-Thurs so you can have Friday off. Not all management is great, but there are a handful that truly do care about their employees and go out of their way to help you grow. Workloads are often heavy which can feel overwhelming at times. However, your hard work is recognized and will lead to opportunities to grow."
good,Will make you feel like your home. Great working enviroment for anybody. Come in look at the schedule of what you'll be roasting and get put in a good of hard workers and learn something new everyday.

good,"A typical day at  work, I give it my all. I enjoy working and exceeding expectations. One thing I've learned is I proved to myself that I can get adapt easily to new situations.

good,"Preserving the culture at the company is the top priority and is what makes this place unique. The culture is rooted in 120 years of this American icon, but is forward-looking with a fun and amenity-rich corporate headquarters to match. Smucker truly gives each employee the opportunity to be a part of something bigger than his or her individual job function."
good,It's a good place to work with a great campus and culture. There are a lot of long term employees. Management supports the employees ad their work for the most part.

good,A company truly committed to strong ethics and quality. I was able to gain good supervision skills and a better understanding of business ethics. I appreciate my time there and would consider them a great example for the food industry.

good,Good Workplace and nice coworkers.  Beautiful campus and state of the art facility.  Rewards and recognition is more often than expected.  This company offers extraordinary benefits.
good,Smuckers will always be a great place to work and grow as long as they have such great brands to manage and sell.  Their treat every employee like they make a difference.  It is not uncommon to see senior C-level employees sitting and having lunch with the most junior level analysts.  The best part of the job was always the interaction with our customers as they engage in selling our strong brands and their desire to work with us to bring our products to the consumer.  The biggest challenge Smucker will face in teh future is keeping their great company culture in place as they expand and grow through acquisition.
