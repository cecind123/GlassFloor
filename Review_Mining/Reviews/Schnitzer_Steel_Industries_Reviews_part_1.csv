rating,review
bad,Horrible company to work for. Alot of favoritism and employee abuse. Supervisors are very disrespectful and does not assist nor help employees. Alot of broken promises and no room for advancement.
bad,If you play fantasy football or are friends with the boss then you have it made and wont even break a sweat but if you dont feel like sucking up to the office people the. You might as well not even apply
bad,I worked for schnitzer for a couple years and while I was there countless times I was bullied by one of the supervisors. he would throw my things and talk to me as if I was his child just as he did with a few other co workers. I also while working there got hurt a couple times and was asked not to go to the hospital and also asked to lie about how I was hurt. This company will be little anyone that is not up to their standards. I ended up getting fired for going and doing side work while I was off for a couple weeks.
bad,"I put an application in and was contacted immediately, what they want isn’t worth your time and effort. They will work you to the bone and act like you are going to move up and next thing you know everything was a lie. Please don’t wast your skills here, they are a worthless company and unless you know the boss or a high up person just move on"
bad,Constantly belittled by management over the radio. MGMT will tell you one thing and do another. Different privelegas giving to different people. MGMT will say no to something the literally do exactly the same thing if it's too their benefit. Instead of training and promoting the hard working guys that have been their for years they constantly hire someone new instead of training the guys who have put in the time for years. Expect lay offs twice a year minimum. Corporate beaucracy is what this company thrives on. Foreman and yard manager are high paid bullies
bad,"I worked at schnitzer for about two months through a temp agency. It was quite the experience, my time spent there!(hence the duration) so much so I don't believe a review would be enough to express my grievances an displeasures in a short & disprictive professional manner. I will state prior till me deciding this situation wasn't worth it, an employee stated to me that he felt bad, but he was instructed to yell at me, which got me thinking what else was he instructed to do? Specifically regarding me. The only individual that it seemed as though it was being done too. From the gate I peeped that it was a toxic environment, well at least within the department I was placed in which was the swing shift shredd crew. Also from one of the directing managers from the day crew."
bad,They need more people . they make one person do 3 peoples jobs . no life outside work . some of the management was poor.  No proper training . you cant have any time off . you dont get breaks .
bad,Mgrs. and Supervisor have no integrity.  Do not care of anyone's safety.  Only care about themselves.  Union does nothing for its members.  The worst place I have ever worked at.
bad,Under Paid being worked in the ground multitasking all over the place health risk.from smoke to material.low morale.bad. security faulty equipment right.now it's not a place i would recommend to no one for employment
bad,"At first I enjoyed working here until about after a year. The management there is a joke! They tried to fire me for no reason and that didn't go in their favor, DO NOT WORK HERE!!!!!!!!!!"
bad,Thought it was a great place at first and then realized that the general manager was an uneducated and incompetent liar that was threatened by my formal education and aspirations to become a GM. They will work you into the ground and only point out the bad. Terrible place to work.
bad,Terrible place to work for. Supervisors weren’t even trained on the lockout tag out process and spoke broken English. Magnet sucks and it’s so hard to get in touch with HR. Complete waste of time. If actually have skills that will benefit a company then don’t take them there.
bad,"worked here for just under a year, pay is minimal, management is spread to thin. Benefits suck pay isn't good. No incentives for staff or management, lots of broken promises regarding pay. High turnover rate training is non existent"
bad,Management was very hypocritical. Little to no advancement opportunities. The union is a joke. The only thing you can count on from the 701 is your union dues being taken out every month. Other than that good luck with em.
bad,"Find another job "
bad,"Got hired as a operator, would only operate for 15min if I was lucky. The rest of the time I was doing some random job. Guys on the equipment were scared that you would take their job so you were not allowed to operate. The bosses lied about job and made it seem great but they didn't care about you at all"
bad,"Very difficult place to work. I was hire as General Manager but was never given the opportunity to manage my yard. Had constant interference from other managers. This facility was purchased for 75 million, but was only worth maybe 10 million. So, upper level management was constantly trying to cover there tracks. Employees from the former owner created a hostile enviorment for the new management. False acusations were leveled on new management and upper level management in fear of the labor force walking off the job released the new management. Information about the difficulties of this location were never disclosed to this new manager."
bad,"Very little focus on the ""people"" part of the business. Work/Life balance is not a priority. Would not recommend working here."
bad,This company is not a good place to work and for this im in search of other work.
bad,"Schnitzer steel is very nice company to work with, we have a code of conduct being practice by the employee that make the company world most Ethical but it doesnt happen to Pick N Pull barlow, the Store Manager dont know what is integrity and respect. He doesnt deal that to his employee and to Customer, customer who didnt sign the log book in going in is banned to enter the store premises."
bad,The high turn over and lack of proper management lead to a vast decline in the work culture as I worked there. They do not put safety as the highest priority and that can be lethal in such a dangerous work environment.
bad,"Stay away from the SLC location.  They will lie to you to recruit you.  It is a broken location.  Training is pood, leadership is sketchy, emloyees rarely held acountable for attendance.  There is a lot of finger pointing. "
bad,Management allows employees to treat you poorly and scream at you. There was hardly any guidance in training and always felt like you were going to be in trouble. One problem employee was aloud to do whatever they wanted and make you feel uncomfortable and talk down to you. Even after complaining nothing was done. Save yourself your sainity and find another job this place isn’t worth your time. After multiple meetings with upper management they kept problem employees and let the good ones go.
bad,Horrendous management that uses bullying and intimidation tactics rather than actually managing. Zero family or home life as the hours expected to work are unrealistic and so stressful! Very hostile work environment with no team atmosphere or support. Was initially excited about joining the company and the union benefits it came with. I quickly learned that it's very cut throat and no amount of benefits sugar coats how far down they beat you as a person.
bad,"company has great potential, too many bean counters and no knowledgeable experienced managers, just over educated no experience managers."
bad,"You’re just a number to them, they’ll use you until they don’t need you then will let you go. I worked my butt off for over a year and was laid off a week after my child was born. My friend was laid off a day before his first house payment. The manager literally asked about my child and family one day and the next day laid me off."
bad,"I joined Schnitzer Steel for the benefits for my family. I quickly found that my co-workers were unwelcoming. I will only say that my job was in transportation in Tacoma, WA. Essentially, my co-workers (or equals) had talked badly about me so much, and threw me under the bus, that the management fired me for something I DID NOT do."
bad,Not a place i would recommend. Worked there for almost a year and was promised one thing after another and none of it happened. Yard managers were disrespectful to employees and other mgrs talked behind your back.
bad,Place is a joke don't care about you or anything you got going on. They want you to give them a notice but will lay you off and day any time of the week. WILL STAB YOU IN THE BACK AND WATCH YOU CROPPY FLOP!!!
bad,"Everyday I would go to work walking on eggshells, afraid of getting let go because there was a lot of favoritism. The turn around rate is very high. They are constantly highering and firing people and the purchasing agent that put up a good review of this company is probably the one that there was constant flirting between her and the manager. Corporate needs to nip this in the bud!"
bad,"The market and mostly the new regional director in the west region are causing longtime employees to leave or start looking for employment elsewhere (especially the women).  The atmosphere has become toxic and we’re taking on water.  They boast about winning some most ethical company award every year, but we all know that’s bs.  Examples of unethical behavior are everywhere.  They’re cutting salaries and hours for the workers at the bottom of the food chain but the work load hasn’t decreased, but they still expect you to keep up."
bad,"Place is going down hill. Employees leaving left and right. There you are a number. They should pay more for their expectations. Need to meet the "" Numbers "" that change everyday. They tell you how many cars need to be processed daily at the start of the month and then it's never enough. They push and push . Working 6 days a week and sometimes 7 takes a toll on the employees. Underpaid.."
bad,Very high turn over of management and non-salaried staff. They seem to throw a lot of money around but don't give the type of trainning that is necessary to keep newly hired employees.
bad,Feel this employer has not been able to make emoployees feel safe in their jobs even after a long time employment.  Human Resource department is awful in handling personnel issues and management is inconsistent.
bad,"Job: Relatively easy. Consistent hours. Good benefits."
bad,Back stabbers. Be careful if you think the other drivers like you cause they will get you fired and get together and make up some BS on you and management will listen and believe it.
bad,Agian office Manager was awesome as for others I will leave that alone They don't care about you or your family or if you have kids any of that just as long as you are there at 730 am
bad,"Work life balance is horrible.. 70+ hours per week.  Huge disconnect between corporate and what actually occurs onsite.  Not a chance I would ever take this job again, no matter how much they pay!"
bad,"This used to be a great place to work but over the last four years the management has changed multiple times and the head doesnt know what the tail is doing, management has never done the jobs that the workers do but like to criticise the employees."
bad,Cleaned house didn't care to understand the system or process.  seemed to be interested in bottom line rather than communication with employees and management team
bad,"Schnitzer has a razor thin profit margin (if they still make a profit) and everything about the culture reflects that. Business is hard and the future isn't bright. What I gained working at Schnizter though was an appreciation for how my own skills and abilities do me very well even under adverse conditions, such as upper management lacking the ability to give a coherent vision for the future and the constant layoffs. I am not sad that I worked there and met some really awesome people. But for sure not a recommended experience."
bad,Please don't work here. They have gone though so many people in the office and will not  be any different no matter how hard you work. They run them off if office manager gets jealous .please please don't go there!!!!
bad,"the pasco yard is just a feeder yard to Portland, problem with that is Portland is never happy with what you do. the buyers don't explain to the customer about what is wanted and not wanted so they are always sending hate mail are bad phone calls telling you that your not doing your job wright."
bad,"I learned that backstabbing is the way to the top of the ladder.  If you are good at throwing folks under the bus, you will fit right in.  You are simply a number and no one cares about anything but the bottom line.  Safety is what they preach 24x7 but this is one of the most unsafe places I have ever worked at.  I'm amazed that they are still in business and have not been shut down by OSHA.  The only time they pay attention to safety is when someone dies or are critically hurt.  There are some real hard workers there but they are not recognized at all.  The ones that have been there forever and do nothing are the ones who keep making the money and getting raises.  It's ridiculous but it's a job."
bad,This company is so interested in the bottom line that they will work you until you drop. 70 - 80 hour weeks are expected from management. They do not give you the tools or personnel to do your job correctly.
bad,"The workload was fair. However, management was micro manager, making the environment in the department stressful and uncomfortable. She required everything to be done in the manner she would do it. Not allowing any autonomy. The work conditions became very difficult to endure and cause uneasiness and discomfort the entire time I was there. HR partners do not represent the employees. Instead, the HR partner works in the interest of the company solely. Not providing proper representation/fairness to employees."
bad,"Everything with the company is a farce...they will tell you safety is the top priority and then they have you working with low grade PPE, working in 100 degree weather with no breaks/water AND then 0 degree weather with no consideration.  Production and numbers is all that matters.  Low pay and tyrant leadership above the store level.  Stay away as this place has injuries left and right, pay issues, and the average employee stays less than 90 days."
bad,"The higher ups are ok but direct management is awful."
bad,They no longer have employed long haul drivers everything is owner operator. Not sure what it is like now as they are a American company and no longer live in area to find out what it is like there now.
bad,threatening to take your job away daily.  bad pay scale. very cheap. room for advancement with no raises. you get overtime in place of good wages. never fix equipment and use archaic haul trucks that break down everyday and blow carbon black smoke in your face all day.
bad,They had no use for Asset Managers. Saved them hundreds of thousands of dollars with excellent cost saving programs. Had a great management when I started and a very poor management team when we parted company. They are the worst in the industry from top to bottom. It starts with the CEO and progresses down. Had a great team that left or was let go. Now they are at the bottom of the barrel.
bad,"typical day expectation 5am-4pm plus weekends. Expectations are that you are always there and available by phone at all times. Weekends are expected, management questions and micromanages at every turn. "
bad,We work 12 hour days and 6 days a week mandatory. Most of the time our Sundays are required as well. Any time you miss is automatically pulled from your PTO. Managemt is horrible.
bad,"When I started working for Steel Pacific, before they were bought out by Schnitzer, I enjoyed what they stood for; ""Keep It In Play"". As an avid recycler, I loved the idea of re-selling good ""junk"", and recycling what was left. Now however, the model has been changed to crush everything and sell it as scrap, and other services like toilet and tire recycling have disappeared. The loss of the ""Outdoor Hardware Store"" was a bitter pill to chew for regulars of the last 50 years, and now it's just another Corporate metal crusher - hot, stinky, and streamlined."
bad,This place was fun. Until new management showed up. Now everyone is scared for there jobs. Not a good place at all.
bad,Low pay for hard work salary should be hire then the pay you receive all benefits should be 100% all around this is the lowes paying union job I ever had they need to catch up with the pay of high coast of living in the area. And medical benefits need to be a 100% covered.
bad,"Has the potential to be a great company but lacks leadership and direction."
good,The culture seems to be stuck in the 70s it's a mid-size company that always says they have to much to adopt progressive management techniques
good,"I was hired on a temp at the corporate  office, told I would be temp to hire. I had to pay my own parking upwards of $15 per day! The training was insufficient and when I did more in depth work than just entry was told not to?? Manager was ok but very lacking in communication with what is expected. The whole accounting department is a disaster with things on their books for years and departments blaming each other for it not being fixed instead of coming up with a plan."
good,good place to work for money but advancement opportunities minimal look out for yourself type of place (unless someone get injured then we are a team and need to look out for each other) but the actual employees amazing and hard-working
good,"Lots of gossip,drama, management if they like you you can move up in the company  ,they tend to get rid of employees who are older and have been with the company a long time.decent benefits and over time. Management tells you what you want to hear then dissmiss's you ."
good,"8 to 5 expectation, not a generally helpful environment, great people around, just not the right fit."
good,The front office manager was to busy try to prove she was in charge and general manager was inexperienced of supervise a large number of employees. He made a lot of poor decision when it came to some important safety issues on the job site.
good,Working for this company has been a pleasure but in all honesty the hrs we work are close to slave hrs. Granted we do get paid well but it kills your family life... so if your in it for the money this is the company but if you value family then you might wanna look other places.
good,Slow to move up. The economy has effected the scrap industry and Schnitzer Steel is starting to feel the pressure. Welding and truck driving seem to be the best jobs.
good,Responsible to ensure operations were ran effectively on a daily basis.  Inexperience in the scrap steel industry was working against me along with minimum supervision and coaching.  shortage of manpower and equipment did not allow our team to properly bid or complete a job in a timely manner which effected our ability to establish clientele.
good,Schnitzer was a great place to work but has recently become an undesirable workplace.  The safety culture is poor and the management is unfocused.
good,Worked at Pick n pull in summit ill typical day is very busy especially in summer the main manager who is in control of the cashiers has no proper training most the time she was in the office and not helping to properly train new people just showed how to do it few times how to operate and count your drawer and charge customers and than after that your on your own...the female employees working as cashiers have attitude problems dont even ask them any questions because they will roll your eyes at you and make angry faces easy job but i wouldnt recommend this location
good,Worst place to work at literally high school all over again the co workers will gossip about you for anything and if you don't stay on their positive side means kiss there butt they will speak about you over escalating to even getting your fired.  The sales girls don't do nothing but be on there phone and rude to customers I had so many complains. Worst part is the manager takes there side because they all been working there for years so clearly he would reside with them on anything.  It's a decent job but just the drama is nothing to bare it is literally full of negativity all I can say is remain to yourself and don't talk to anybody.
good,"was long time ago.Do not remember much except i liked my supervisor. most enjoyable was have a powerful machine at my finger tips, stressful but fun"
good,"The yard managers were great to work with. They're direct to the point, and don't sugar coat much which I appreciate it. They encourage you to work independently or as team and don't micro manage you as long as you stay efficient. They provide lunch or bbq's periodically for various reasons such as so many days without injuries ect which makes us feel appreciated."
good,"Management has gone down hill in the 17 yrs., a typical day at work was get in your machine and move scrap all day, co-workers where all good people and a joy to work with."
good,Company was not properly run by management which led to very heavy layoffs as company was trying to save money. Fellow employees were good to work with.
good,"Enjoyed position, people were great, work flow and projects were interesting.  Fair pay however company has made a lot of cut backs and had a number of lay offs."
good,Good company to work for. Layed back mentality with most co workers. Could use some management structuring. The place is located on a section of property traded by a train track. Hard place to leave if you need to get somewhere on time.
good,"-receiving trucks and loading trucks with materials"
good,"I felt as if I was just a number while working at Schnitzer Steel. I was also commuting from Salem to down town Portland every day and it was extremely hard on my vehicle. If you like the ""Corporate"" world, then Schnitzer Steel is the Company for you. I prefer the more family oriented companies myself. I am a hard worker, praise means more to me then the money. I just felt like a little guppy in an ocean, working at Schnitzer Steel, later I found out I wasn't the only one who felt this way. I did like the fact that I was busy from start to finish which made each day fly by."
good,"This was the first fortune 500 company I worked for, I learned how fast pace a large corporation is.  I performed above expectation and was appreciated by my accounting supervisor (the lead CPA), my corporate controller, and the CFO and CEO of the company."
good,not to bad to work for but the only problem is that stability within the company is very bad. even if you do your job you could be without 1 due to company cut backs. the staff is good and work very hard to make the company money but the prob is that it is publicly traded so staff cuts are inevitable.
good,Schnitzer is always looking for great people to join the team! We are in the midst of forging a new path and leading the pack in the metals industry. This is a good place to work if working with fantastic people in important to you!
good,My day began @ 4:00AM to 4:00PM dispatching trucks while answering phones from customers. I was in charge of the maintenance and DOT records for DOT compliance As a manager I was sent to seminars to learn additional management methods and procedures. My co-workers were the best people to work with and allowed my management skills to succeed. The hardest part of my job was my weakness to say no to help others not in my job classification which always made my day with longer hours. I always have fun as that is just my nature to make good out of hard to accomplish task.
good,"Worked various positions, fast paced, learned 6 positions. Hardest part was extreme temps. in equipment most enjoyable was the employees and customers and seeing how much you got done in a day."
good,The company is facing headwinds currently causing a multitude of layoffs and store closures.  The work environment is very pleasant and the people are great. The job was mostly a production AP position which did not lend itself to many variations. That being the hardest part of the job.  The most enjoyable part was that I knew my job well and did my job well.
good,"45 hours a week  opening and closing the store as the mod   learned most of my stockroom to the floor techniques ,managementt was very instrumental in  my development  from mit to store director of my first 5 million dollar store the most was merchandising monthly  ad sets and flows."
good,"Working for Schnitzer was like being with family. Management was fair, very supportive.The most enjoyable part of the job was celebrating milestones and birthdays."
good,Schnitzer was not a good place to work. The work life balance was not encouraged.  The management did not listen to the non management at all.  Don't recommend
good,The pay was worth the job but it is hard work. Most days I leave work all dirty and itchy. You are working outside so you are hot when it’s hot and freezing when it’s cold out. The work culture sucks because it is very cliquey and you can tell gossip goes around fairly quickly.
good,"The job or  work isn""t  hard  at this company, but  management ,  changes non-stop  With little or no knowledge dealing with metal. Honesty isn't here."
good,Sound business model with endless potential. Good people working in the field that proud themselves on meeting company goals and metrics.
good,I enjoyed working at schnitzer steel. They have competitive wages and treat you well. The company is very safety oriented and has on site safety training.
good,"She seemed like a nice lady just wish that her communication skills were better, because she could have let me know that the last day was going to be my last day, it would have save everyone alot of problems."
good,I liked working for schnitzer steel. It was a good internship and I really liked the people I worked with. The hardest part of the job was working in the sun.
good,"Was challenged in ways I hadn't been before in previous jobs, office manager was fantastic.  People at the location and in the company at other locations all very helpful."
good,"My main task was to ensure business processes were in place to use SAI as the ERP system. That meant learning the business and system we were migrating to, but had no documentation or any foreknowledge of what the new system was like. It was a culture shift for the employees as Schnitzer (large corporation) had just moved into Canada(a bunch of small companies). My main task was to prepare the employees and make sure the business did not shut down when the system went live. The people from head office were great. The project went fairly smoothly."
good,"If you don't mind the hands on experience and getting your hands dirty, this is the job for you."
good,A typical day at work you see the trucks coming into the site. Lots of people in their safety gear as the environment is industrial. I learned a new industry and a new business I did not know existed. The staff knows their information and are very informed with the ever changing market prices.
good,Nice employees and work balance. I was a contractor so can't answer most of these questions.  Interesting industry to learn about but is very volatile.
good,"Was a good job, hauled a variety of recyclables from a variety of industrial sites, so the was a nice variety of locations and each day wasn't the same as the last. Worked with good people, management was also good."
good,Job great! Compensation was good. A lot of advancement opportunities. Management is poor and worries more about their bottom line than their emloyees.
good,"A great company to work for in a very tough business. Despite market challenges the Management team is extremely supportive."
good,"It can be a challenging place at times, but they are never shy about providing you with the safety equipment and training that you require, and they will recognize and promote those that they think are deserving. They aren't the most generous with their wages and salaries, but they are at least average."
good,days are busy so time flies by. working closely with general public so could be good/could be bad. Working with scrap metal.
good,"Lots of hands-on work/learning. Typical work day would be operating a heavy crane, moving salvage material into its proper place."
good,"I have been fortunate enough to work for Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. for roughly 2 and a half years, and have enjoyed my time as part of the Metals Recycling Business' Northeast Regional team. During my time with the company, I have been exposed to all aspects of Human Resources, and was given the freedom to approach issues, projects, and day-to-day activities independently. My managers have supported me as I have grown with the company, and truly value my input, feedback, and suggestions. I have developed a number of professional relationships at this company, and will carry the knowledge I have obtained with me throughout my career."
good,This company is a great place to work.  They promote from within and make every effort to do the right thing by it's employees and the environment.  The pay could be better but the benefits are top notch.
good,"If you like working outside this is for you. If you can't handle heat in summer and freezing weather in winter we'll good luck, but they do provide things that will help with the weather conditions."
good,"I was hired as a consultant with the possibility of joining Schnitzer in the Internal Audit Unit.  However, management determined a new positions was not viable at the time.  So I continued working as a  consultant in the Internal Audit Unit and Operations as a Sarbanes-Oxley Auditor."
good,"its  being  a hard part of the is to keep  partime employees motivated so I allow my assistants and I to provide on going training and accountability, the most enjoyable is to see the efforts of you're work based on results such as sales ,Audit results and p&l monitoring the hard part of the job was to get goals met when mechanical failures  to heavy equipment ."
good,i worked for schnitzer steel for a coupple years and enjoyed every moment of it all the crews were really good to work with got to see al of the oil sands
good,"Typical day at work would be basically, getting job assignment the night before.  Getting into work and do your daily inspection on the truck and then head out for the day.  When assignment is complete you call in to get your next assignment."
good,"love work at there, great environment, great employees, good benefits, great hours of operations, pto hrs, supervisors are hands on, the training class they give is hands on so you can learn a lot."
good,Very progressive environment and one where leaders are invested in talent and would go above and beyond to provide the tools and resources to succeed. I miss Schnitzer.
good,"Good group of people, good pay and benefits, management for the most part leaves you alone. Hardest part of the job out there was you were seperate from the rest of the group."
good,good place to work....long hours and high miles. Everybody there was good to work with..Winters can get alittle hard. Sometimes the Roads can be bad but other then that I injoyed driving
good,"typical workday started off you setting up your work area "
good,It was good place to work I was in the maintenance dept and also ordered all the parts for the maintenance and plant
good,Same as my previous statement. The company had my best interest at heart.
good,I'm sure most people have a few complaints about their job or work but I absolutely loved working at this company the crew that I was working with are great and helped and taught me a lot. I was able to run a lot of heavy equipment and get certifications for all of it I learned how to work on different machines it was great.
good,the job is not hard but it can be very demanding at times. if you like working with your hands and being outdoors then this is the job for you. the management is easy to get along with too and very help full
good,"Facilitated and trained managers for compliance with state ferderal employment law to reduce risk. Developed core competency identification by position for supervisors, mangers, department directors and executive management."
good,Schnitzer is a great place to work. Good to employees with lots of room to advance. I learned more in three months about office work than I thought I could thanks to a great office manager.
good,"Great place to work if your really ready to work. Hard work was your best friend here. The company is always expanding. If your looking to make a good living and do it honestly, this is the place."
good,"Typical day at work consisted of dealing with suppliers, truck drives, mechanics, welders and running of the warehouse.  I found that it was constantly changing and you would have to put out a lot of fires but enjoyed this type of environment.  "
good,"I've been working for Schnitzer Steel as an operator for about thirteen years. Located in Everett, Ma. The company has great job security and alot of benefits. Through networking, I was able to help a few people gain employment over the course of the last ten years. Anyone with management or operations experience, Schnitzer is a great place begin or start a career."
good,"Best job I ever had, I wish there wasn't so many cut backs and so many division that got closed without notice, was extremely sad to leave there."
good,"learned varies lessons from all employees. "
good,Good company management needs to be redone they'll blame you for stuff you didn't know existed and get mad when you dont go along with it. But employees are great to work with
good,"Schnitzer was a great place to work (Surrey). Its too bad that the metal commodity industry isnt very stable, which did affect my employment. Management was good and culture was generally good. Wages could have been a bit higher, as my position was paid averagely compared to industry standard. This was a very enjoyable place to work and the people are fantastic. I was sad to leave."
good,Learned a vast amount of knowledge about the recycling and repurposing industry. Obtained many new skills with the guidance of more experienced supervisors and co-workers.
good,"Started my day around 430 am. The work was challenging and demanding. Management was in and out, and sometimes non existent until they finally brought in respectable knowledgeable people."
good,"I worked on the shredder sorting copper, it required heavy lifting and long hours. I improved my teamwork skills and followed strict safety guide lines. The management was good they treat there employees really well, It was dirty and took a little getting used too but the hardest part of the job was getting to the end of Lombard where it is located. The most enjoyable part of the job was the long hours and the fast paced environment."
good,"I very much enjoyed working in the steel recycling industry , being a welder fabricator it was like working in a candy store"
good,I worked with awesome co-workers and we made a very strong team working together. A typical day at work for me was to process title paperwork for California stores. I had to follow state and federal guidelines when processing all DMV paperwork for cars purchased by Pick N Pull.
good,"Great job I just have to move on due to an unforeseen housing situation. Overall I would of liked to continue working for the company, but currently is not the right time for me."
