bad,"Awful place, unless your a yes man/rat you wanna stay away, treat people awful with no respect at all...……"
bad,They make up their own rules and have some of the worst policies. I would not tell anyone to work their the pay is good but the management is one of the worst that I have ever seen.
bad,Not a great culture to work in. Not friendly toward other ethnic people. Not open to ideas of other people. Management was almost absent from work area
bad,"Bad work environment "
bad,"Hier als flexkracht gewerkt. Door een hele afdeling getreiterd en weggepest. Uitgesloten worden, over je roddelen, niet ingewerkt worden zodat je alles ""fout' doet. Zeer botte directe ""collega"" die alleen maar kon grommen en snauwen. Leidinggevende werd zelf onder de voet gelopen en deed niks. Heel veel stress gehad en was een traumatische ervaring. Later bleek dat die hele afdeling al eerder iemand had weggepest. Bang voor iemand die kwaliteiten heeft???"
bad,the company's management is very harsh and very critical of employee's performance. the various projects assigned to the workers were often more than one person could complete on their own.
bad,I have been an operator for 30 years and can honestly say the 5 years I spent at Eastman Chemical in Texas City was one of the most hostile environments I can ever remember. Management cares nothing for the health and welfare of its emplyees and team managers are free to treat employees any way they want without any retribution. However the other locations of Eastman seem to do far better in employee welfare the Texas City site is in need of a complete makeover.
bad,"Benefits keep getting lower and smaller and no decent pay increases or bonus pay unless you are an executive and have an office job. the little guys do not matter anymore , they tell us we are a dime a dozen"
bad,"In my opinion, this company is not the best place to work any longer. Thier benifits have steadily decline over the years and so have the bonuses. They don't have a pension any longer, only a 401k. If your an older employee when you start, you better save all you can or no retirement. Thier in field departments are in clicks. If you put in to move to another area to work the employee's have alot of clout on who gets the job or not. Even if you maybe more qualified than the other person's. Management seemed to be always out to get someone. This company is never wrong in anything attitude. Would never work again for this company."
bad,"Decent compensation, poor management. They say the right things but it never translates into actual practice. Policies are frequently overbearing and oppressive. Difficult place to work."
bad,"The work is very repetitive. Mandatory overtime is enforced too often.If your a ""yes"" man you would be a great fit for management here because that is exactly what upper management wants.12 hr swing shifts are hard to deal with and make doing things outside of work very difficult. The atmosphere is very stressful and the pay is the only reason most people continue to stay."
bad,"Was a good company and place to work.  Management now thinks it's a management consulting company.  Has destroyed the previously good culture, morale, and future financial and employment outlook for the company.  Now being used as an enrichment vehicle for top managers while shipping jobs to Hyderabad."
bad,"Good pay and benefits but those aren’t worth the lies and back stabbing that goes on, unless you are part of the click then get used to being lied to and treated like dirt"
bad,"Tough work environment, poor management styles.  Targeted by upper manager that obviously didn't like me.  Would not even say hello when greeted by me.  However, my immediate manager was very fair, and encouraging."
bad,"Don't worry about getting ahead here unless you're part of the goo ol boys network.  Welcome to working in Kingsport, TN at the Big E.  Always cost cutting and letting people ""volunteer"" to be fired go or just firing them."
bad,Wouldn't recommend it unless it's a temporary door to stack money- but plan on working for it and plenty of hazing even from management. It's a joke. .
bad,"Keine festen Aufgabebgebiete."
bad,"The job is very stressful for salary grade people and there is no job security what so ever.  Every-time there is a dip in stock prices be prepared that someone is more than likely going to lose their job.  If you are lucky and aren't the individual that get's let go, just be ready to start working two jobs."
bad,"If you want job security then DO NOT work for Eastman. If you want to advance in your career...do not work for Eastman. Management is clueless as to what anyone does and it is the ""little people"" that allow this company to have record earnings year after year. But those earnings do not trickle downward to the people that actually made the company that money."
bad,Training in my department was to have had 1 trainer for 4 years had 3 in 1st 15 months. 2 had never trained anyone else before. What does that tell you?
bad,"Good Ole boy policy's are still  in place, teachers pet mentality, Anything less than college education treated as lower class. Salaries have been reduced and responsibility has increased. Inability to keep a HR Manager on site at the Fieldale VA site over past 10 years makes it impossible to be heard and understood, what the Department, Managers say is the only truth being heard."
bad,"Horrible Benefits"
bad,Eastman's main concern is for themselves. They do not appreciate the hard work that their employees do for them. Training is minimal and difficult to understand for people who have never been in the role.
bad,I entered the company with a degree but was prevented from advancing to a level comparative with my degree. I tried for years to be viewed as a professional but was constantly overlooked.
bad,Very cutthroat tells you can advance & it doesn’t happen changes schedule and it’s either work it or out the door seniority doesn’t matter not honest.
bad,"I applied as a an entry-level chemical operator, after unsuccessful attempts at being hired in corporate .  My intention was to get my foot in the door and then work my way up in the field which I have experience and bachelors degree.  After being hired, I discovered that I am ineligible to even apply for any other jobs for seven years.  As an operator, you are the lowest of the low. You have no choice in your assignment,  they tell you what, where, when, how, and why; and expect you to like it.  Moral is low in most of operations.   You could work 10 years in one department and be an expert in what you do, and then be moved with no warning to entirely different job where you know nothing.  Here’s a tip: just because a 22-year-old engineer has done the calculations and wants to change the process, you’re better off listening to your operator who’s been here 40 years and says it won’t work. "
bad,The pay is good and benefits are ok. Benefits are being cut every year it seems for cost reduction. Management is terrible and there are allot of managers. Too many chiefs and not enough indians... The company likes to brag about the Eatman culture but to be honest the culture is very poor. If you dont mind being treated like a number instead of a person then you might like it.
bad,Large company that puts profits above all else.  Average pay and benefits.  work / life balance pretty good.  work environment is average.
bad,"When I started in IT at Eastman 7 years ago it was an amazing environment with a great starting salary and even better management who genuinely cared about your personal, and career development. Developers were provided with advancement opportunities and were encouraged to explore new roles that interested them. Today you will only be offered new opportunities if you are mediocre at your job and deemed non-essential (hence the poor management), or if the new CIO's latest big idea involves something you are very good at. Over the past 3 years, Eastman IT laid off the majority of employees who had been with the company 30+ years, resulting in a drought of subject matter experts and piles of technical debt. You will be offered a position doing a certain job but on your first day there is a 90% chance you will be doing something completely different which you may not enjoy, and there is little chance of changing roles. Younger employees naive enough to stay (me) are overworked because of demands that the many, many layers of IT Management will not say no to. IT decisions are driven by managers outside of IT who read an article about some new technology or paid a consulting firm tens of thousands of dollars for their poor opinion on the subject.  This is the second year I have been at Eastman that we have been denied raises (better than the pay CUTS in 2009) because of the company's financial performance; meanwhile the CEO uses one of Eastman's private jets to travel back and forth between Kingsport and his home in Florida every week. Your offer letter will seem enticing, but the"
bad,Applied for a position within my department. Was granted interview. Interviewed with two managers. Hiring manager did not show up even though his office was down the hallway. Left me sitting there until I finally left the conference room. When he saw I was back at my desk called me to his office to let me know he had promised a job to someone outside the company and one he had previously interviewed for another position.
bad,Management was always changing. Have worked there 5 years and have had 4 different supervisors. Too much red tape/bureaucratic inertia . Great pay but work weekly rotating shifts
bad,Really thought I would like working here. That was wrong. Management has no idea what is going on and constantly changing the atmosphere for the worst. Pay is good but when you factor in how bad the Benifits are it's not worth it. Being degraded by high management comes with the territory.
bad,"This site has been acquired by Eastman. Working culture isnt good for a place to work at. Full of politics, and it is only about who you know but not what you are capable of. People on the floor are the most trustworthy ones because they are honest and dont play politics and tricks. "
bad,Toxic culture and mediocre benefits. Annual layoffs and a force ranking system that mandates that 5% of employees had to be let go. Kingsport location offers no other comparable jobs making it risky to move there. I knew several people who lost $40k plus selling their houses after being laid off.
bad,"The company management needs a serious overhaul; specifically the CEO.  They are moving jobs from a loyal and rural community to overseas locations.  They do major layoffs every couple of years.  The culture is very tense and they do not put a lot of focus on what you do right.  Only what you do wrong.  There are individuals that are wonderful people and just want to help you do well.  On the other hand, you have to watch out for the people that are just looking to get ahead and will step on you to do it."
bad,"Poor management. Too many meetings and nothing productive was accomplished. Everyone believes they are right and will not work together as a team to get the job done. Job duties were too much for one person. Instead of hiring enough people, they would overwork multiple people by giving them two or more full time jobs to do."
bad,could not get proper training for co-workers instead it was long days of being teased and laughed at by them and being blamed for all mishaps or mistakes.
bad,"Work was great, the only problem i had with them is the long hours and never a day off the 3 months i worked there. Saw my daughter once out of the 3 months being there"
bad,"Poor Leadership, A very dangerous and nasty job, Not really sure who the boss is. Constant fear of being reprimanded. Too Many Chiefs not enough indians,"
bad,"If you want to have a good life and get paid. This is probably a perfect place for you to work. "
bad,"Realize up front that the interview process is a pain in the *** for a candidate."
bad,"I was generally happy at Eastman, but I found that employee interactions were often separate from management involvement. I found this to be a hindrance in early career development. With no structured mentor program, it was a toss-up whether a new employee would settle into a role within the organization. Fitting in would result from a good employee/mentor pairing, while isolation could just as easily result from a bad pairing. Mid-level management always seemed willing to invest in employee training, but seemed very uninterested in workflow management. High-level management, on the other hand, seemed content to use the existing employees and capital resources to the utmost with minimal reinvestment. I found the culture to be inadequate, and often contradictory. While the tagline suggested an environment of cooperation and mentoring, a rating system shifted the focus to competition. While the company spoke of a culture of internal innovation, it shifted heavily into mergers and acquisitions during my time there. While it touted principles of diversity, it has made only meager, if any, progress in enhancing workplace diversity and inclusion."
bad,"As company losing its market share in their core segments, the weakness and the true character of the management. Top management, starting from VP level is very capable, but the middle management is mostly people from colleges from east tennessee area. If you are not from the area, it is very hard to grow in the company."
bad,"A typical day at work varied from tearing into all electrical and pneumatic tools such as changing bearings or brushes or armatures, to changing fins and housings and gears. I learned to work on all tools from tearing them completely apart and replacing everything to just changing minor things like brushes or bearings. My coworkers were rather horrible and little to no respect for anyone. They made it a very hostile work environment for me. The hardest part of my job would've been learning to completely tear a tool apart and fix things then put it all back together. The most enjoyable thing for me was being able to take breaks and meeting a lot of really nice people since the ones I worked with was terrible."
good,"Zware werkdruk, werknemers zijn een nummer, zeer hoog percentage overspannen werknemers"
good,"A management that cares little to nothing about the employees.  Continuing fear of being laid off or your division shut down.  Has an environment that is comparable to the movie Shawshank Redemption.  If you can go anywhere else and make a living, please do yourself a favor and do so."
good,"Was not that professionally run. Once they made the decision to sell the plant, all capital improvements stopped and the place became run down. Not that pleasant of a work environment."
good,Low energy environment that over the years has been bought and sold many times creating a division amongst personnel and un unwillingness to change or adapt.  Managers lead by hesitancy and often fail to makes decisions either business and or personnel specific that causes a great deal of internal conflict between employees. Have allowed over time niche positions of older employees that does negatively impact the new hires.  Corporate locations often free up their work load by passing off duties to the small sites already under personnel and budget constraints.
good,"Nepotism, consensus-driven culture, little or no career advancement, roles and responsibilities are siloed. Too much process, not practical. Does not know how to manage high potential talents. Quite a few people I worked with did not know they were recognized as high potential until the day they sent in their resignation"
good,"During working in my department, most people are on edge during their main task of loading. If there is any mistake, the penalty is severe due to regulations ect. Some stress is introduced by them by including interns in your supervision that you are fully accountable. There are times that you need to make, but it would hurt making those times to slow down for the intern. There also is very limited chance for advancement"
good,No room for advancement very low pay and no pay increase not fair to employees when it comes to a job opening and they bring in new people instead of advancing
good,"Ok but could be better if they did not pay there management so much and helped the people who actually do the work.  It seems if you live or have lived in Virgina you have a much better chance to get a better paying office type or management position with this company, go figure that one out.  Just go to there office area  and count VA Tags."
good,"I learned at lot while at Eastman.  I worked in the Legal Department for 10 years.  I enjoyed the people that worked there, but management turnover happened each year.  I never knew where I would be placed.  I am not saying any negative things about my past employer. I was laid off in February of this year and received benefits and pay for 26 weeks."
good,"Having worked for Eastman for about 9 years, I would say that it has been an overall positive experience.  The people I have worked with have generally wanted to do a good job and work as a team, and there are no shortage of engineering challenges to take on.  Career advancement seems to go very slowly, and then there may experience several job changes in rapid succession, depending on business needs (i.e., you don't always have a say in where you get placed next).  I have been fortunate enough to have had only 2 supervisors in that time period, so there was good continuity and both expressed genuine care in helping me advance.  The main downside of Eastman, in my experience, has been a poor work/life balance (long work weeks, and off-hours call support), low raises for good performance (~2.5%), and overall just low pay."
good,"Needs better management . "
good,It was a place to work. No advancement unless you where in the in crowd. Good ol boy system was very prevalent. Upper management has no idea how lower management handles employees.
good,"Eastman Chemical is a great company that has a strong purpose, they just lose value with the work culture that is promoted at this company. The HR department is not as progressive as most companies that compare, and they are behind on some of the work-life balance values that are commonly promoted in organizations across the country. While my experience with Eastman was valuable and I learned a lot about the industry, they constantly were dealing with HR issues across their sites.  Management had issues with connecting and valuing their subordinates and therefore I would not promote this company as one that is supportive of their employees."
good,"É uma multinacional americana com uma cultura conservadora arraigada, não há valorização de iniciativas de diversidade & inclusão. O escritório é todo equipado com tecnologia de ponta, mas não há plano de carreira. A Eastman no Brasil não desenvolve seus talentos porque não há oportunidades. É uma boa empresa para quem não tem grandes ambições, pois provavelmente você vai desempenhar a mesma tarefa por anos. Os analistas e estagiários são muito determinados, mas os gestores deixam a desejar. Infelizmente eles não valorizam o pensamento crítico de seus funcionários, e não se abrem para a inovação. O quadro de funcionários é bem enxuto, e a pressão é grande! Para trabalhar na Eastman não é preciso ser competente, é fundamental ser político."
good,"When I was first hired on with Eastman, I was so excited.  If you are going to live in this area, this is THE employer to work for.  I quickly discovered they are not quite the company they used to be.  In previous generations, people knew if they went to work for Eastman and worked hard, they would be with the company for an entire career and would be taken care of.  This is no longer the case.  I watched people who had been with the company 20+ years forced into early retirement because they didn't have a degree (because Eastman told them they didn't need one).  They send all the experience and knowledge out the door to bring in a new group of people with a piece of paper.  (I was one of those people with a piece of paper so I'm not really complaining.)  They company is just not loyal to employees who have been loyal to them.  "
good,"I cannot feel the prospering development in the company. After several human resource cut off and lay off,  I cannot see my personal development in my career.  By using this opportunity, I would like to seek a chance to change job and have further career development though the supply chain which the area I am so confident and familiar."
good,The money is good and there are many good people here; both in production and management. The primary downside is a recent lack of any semblance of a work/life balance company.
good,"In my particular job position, the only way to advance was to say ""Yes, I agree"" to anything the department manager and operations manager said. I would have to say that advancement was never through hard work and accomplishments. It was all about whether management liked you and you submitted to their will."
good,"My job was overly taxing.  Not only was I responsible for everyday responsibilities as an HR Rep would be, but I did payroll for all site employees; as well as acted in a benefits liaison role for employees.  Also including special projects and some employee problem resolution issues.  It was a very face-paced, competitive work environment."
good,"Management in the office is has no idea what actually happens in the plant. Also head management says they care about the employees families but, will call over time two hours before end of shift leaving employees with hardly anytime to get a babysitter if need. And myself I feel that it is a safe place to work but they preach safety but didn't tell you to work faster even if you are already putting out ""daily production"" for nothing extra not evendors a thanks for the hard work."
good,"Little balance between home and work life. Some veteran management never differentiate from old practices. Small town USA, promotes nepotism. Talk about it and wait mindset, not empowered to make quick decisions."
good,"Required to work nights one week and days the next week. Very messy, extremely underpaid, never received a raise. Where i learned how to run a forklift, was my first real industrial maintenance job"
good,Working at Eastman provided stable work.  Working at Eastman is challenging for families because of swinging shifts and never having lunch or dinner at the same time..
good,The people that work there mostly help one another.  The possibility of layoffs makes it stressful at times.  The benefits are not that good compared to other companies out there.
good,"Eastman is the only game in the Tri-Citites area and corporately they seem to take advantage of that.  For a long time Eastman has been considered ""the"" place to work, due to culture and benefits.  Through the past few years and several leadership changes the culture that people raved about has slowly changed.  What used to be a family first environment has moved to a competitive ""dog eat dog"" world.  There are still some in management who are doing their best to preserve the once great internal reputation, however that mentality has left them in the minority and softened their voice. "
good,This place has potential but there is very little advancement for the temporary workers. I like my job but i am interested in starting my career so a career change is in order
good,"I was with Eastman for three years with a co-op and full time. Eastman has had a reputation for having a superior work culture but it is changing. With the berth of a new CEO, the culture is shifting and not for the better."
good,"Grew up in this area my entire life and Eastman was the end all, beat all places to work. Finally got the job (lab tech). The kind of work could be tedious and sometimes pointless, but for the amount of money it was WELL worth it. My co-workers for the most part were great, laid back and easy going. Now the downside...management is pitiful. They were/are out of touch with what is going on even in their own groups. The politics are UNreal. Management are concerned entirely with their own positions and advancement. The policy of bringing in new group managers every 2-3 years with absolutely no experience of what they were managing was brutal. The group ended up training the manger. And NEVER get on someone's bad side...can be a job killer as was my case. The benefits started out pretty good then a few years ago all that went out the window. And promotions...forget it. Someone has to keel over before even consideration is possible."
good,"Eastman is a good company to work for overall. I am a operator at the Longview Texas location. Eastman pay is good for the area but well below what comparable companies such as BP, Exxon, or even smaller companies such as EnBridge pay their employees. Eastman health insurance for people hired post 2010 is a JOKE. Super high deductibles, a person with a family will most assuredly be better off purchasing at the least supplemental health insurance or getting insurance on their own all together. They try and sell you on a flex spending account but it is just your money any way so why bother. Then they have you jumping through hoops all year to qualify for $600 incentives on you $6000 family annual deductible. As far as work schedule they try and sell you on a 14 day per month worked on swing shifts. You end up being forced into more overtime than you want. Forget about holidays because you will be working every one. Yes every Christmas, thanksgiving, ect. Then you have ""shutdowns"" 12 hours a day seven days a week for months at a time. Those are scheduled every two or three years and emergency shutdowns happen at any time. I have averaged one per year so far. If the below par pay, poor health care, and over worked schedule don't get you the politics will. As an operator you are a second rate citizen, engineers run the place and with out the engineering degree you might as well be a burger flipper in their eyes. Favoritism is rampant and advancement is not possible unless you know the right person. That usually does not matter because female employees will always be promoted over"
good,Eastman focus has shifted to prioritizing share holder value at the point that management response to all year end results is always it's not good enough even when divisions make significant cost savings and establish production records and earnings. I'm sure Eastman will achieve its goals but at expense of the employee and work enviroment health.
good,"Great benefits, but at the sacrifice of your family life. Exposure to chemicals. Not a hard job but very dreary, boring 12 hour shift. A lot of paperwork and test samples has to be performed"
good,"They are very good with money. I traveled wherever I wanted, but the management made it so if you are late 3 times in a year no matter if it’s traffic or car breaks down you will get fired. It is stressful every drive to work unless you live next door. Management played favorites allowing certain people that played politics to slide on offenses that would otherwise get you terminated. They over work you forcing mandatory weekend 12 shifts or it comes out of your socks hours. Then they have a rotating shift. Every 3 months you switch from 1st to 2nd and so forth. It is hard to find balance if you have a family."
good,"This was a very competitive job monitoring computer networking and connectivity, worldwide accessibility. Long hours on 12 - hour shifts working shift work."
good,"It was a stressful job. At one time it was a decent place to work, good benefits and the pay was good for the location.  But, things started to change in management and they kept adding on to the jobs without giving more pay and the products were becoming poor quality but, they expected you to produce a certain quota every day."
good,"loved the job, and people that i worked alongside. Management however was always unfair and usually had to kiss butt to advance. good 401k benefits and ok benifits"
good,"Good company. Sometimes they do not value those that have put in a lot of time and tend to find ways to get them out to bring in a younger workforce.  Otherwise, they are the best for this area."
good,"Learned many new things "
good,"This was an average place to work.  They have a flexible work schedule that is really nice and are good if you want time off.  The company is very slow, conservative, departmentalized and bureaucratic.  In the time it takes to develop a new product, the competition has already patented the same thing and is selling it in the market.  If you want to work there, make sure you come in making a good salary, because raises and bonuses are a joke.  They compete locally on salaries, not nationwide within the chemical market."
good,"Management is going crazy, looking for areas to write up valuable employees for the simplest of mistakes.  Pays good but benefits are constantly getting whittled away."
good,"I was a contractor at Eastman.  Contractors are clearly a sub-class at Eastman.  Pay, and benefits were good in some cases, unless your contractor was under bid, and discarded.  Employment thru contractors was often insecure."
good,"I have seen a complete reversal of the culture in just 5 years.  The company I hired into had a wonderful culture where everyone gave 110% to better the company.  Today, most everyone is overworked and spends more time trying to look better than someone else over doing something good for the company.  This is due to a very competitive performance review process that promotes an employees short term ""successes"" rather than company long term growth."
good,job duties routine with industry. decent benefits but were getting progressively worse. low level management was shady at times. constant rotation of upper level management.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Eastman, and I was able to develop myself as aa Operator. The training process in my department was top notch. The safety record for this company is very good."
good,Has good jobs ins some departments
good,Global manufacturing company. Expectations should be at that level. The company employs many people around the world. People come and go everyday. Be prepared to meet people from different backgrounds and different experiences.
good,"A typical day at work is very busy at Eastman. We are slammed in the labs. We are able to learn 5 different labs in my building which allows us to work with many various instruments. Management is very competitive with other buildings. It is overall a very fast paced, intense environment. I think that makes the workers very strong and it also makes them stand out."
good,"Boa empresa, tem alguns problemas, mas dentro do esperado."
good,There are still many differences in the Eastman School and how they conduct operations in the plant. Micromanaging is common in the work place which makes it difficult to carry out the simplest of tasks without being questioned. Also a huge tenure gap which could cause major problems in the future.
good,"Enjoyed working with the friendly people. In addition to this, Red tape and politics but this expected of a huge company"
good,Typical corporate environment but the new executive leadership is turning the company from a family oriented culture into a cut-throat organization.  Change is not for the better.
good,Een internationaal georienteerde werkomgeving in een zeer dynamische markt
good,"Come into work around 1 pm and set the gym up for the children.  Prepare snack and lunch room.  Assist with ones that have homework or projects.  Plan outside activities."
good,"At Eastman Chemical Company, I was responsible for conducting daily reports and monitoring process data for multiple process units via Aspen Process Explorer. Utilizing PFDs and P&IDs as well as conducting pressure surveys and frictional loss calculations through the plant piping, I was able to identify improvements to the process water system which had the potential to save $1.1 million annually. And when tasked with solving ongoing problems relating to differences in heat-up rates in our reactors, I was able to perform heat and mass balances on the system, revealing a discrepancy caused by a miscalibrated steam meter which was the root cause of the problem."
good,"I worked as co-op for 6 months. The work is not hard, and Eastman has a great family environment."
good,The company I came to work for was not the company I worked for when I left. Employees used to be important.  Today it’s the stakeholders and employees come in way at the bottom of the list.
good,"The workplace culture across most businesses and supporting functions is very collaborative.  You will work with some great people who are very talented.  However, the current environment is very stressful and tools/resources needed to do jobs well are not always at hand."
good,"Challenging work"
good,"Typically the day did not consist of very much. Daily rounds at certain areas to check certain equipment. I found myself wanting to go find something to do on most days but I was limited to what I could do. I had quite a bit of knowledge about most of the equipment and how everything worked due to passed experience and quick learning and still didn't get considered for a job. Most of the people are cool, and laid back. But there was a lot of lazy folks that didn't deserve a job over me."
good,Eastman is a good place to start your career. They are very collaborative and it is a good work environment. Stay away from political roles. Your merits are based not on your work performance but how people feel about you. If you are likable you will do well if you are technical then it isn't the best environment.
good,"my typical day start with take over and handing over job from previous shift.review all the jobs and process changing done.check all the page on the control panel.make sure all in order."
good,"Eastman is in transformation.  Guiding Principles are what ever company should aspire to.  There is a long way to make those a reality, but top management is committed."
good,"What Eastman does, they do well. They strive to be a leader in the field but they're not quite there yet. They don't recruit for excellence in talent and their compensation is what I would expect anywhere else. In some areas they may be lagging."
good,"Competitive work environment, Push to get jobs done. Supervision not much help. Benefits are not what they used to be. More about the money then caring about the employee."
good,Leuke tijd gehad met leuke collega's. Goede beloning!
good,"Eastman provides good pay for the regional area (not the nation). The work life balance has slipped as more mandatory overtime is the norm in my area. I would like to see Eastman rework some of the record earnings back to its production employees. I do not see this happening as the new goal is to be Dupont, BASF, and so on creating ""shareholder value"" like most of corporate america. Many in operations will retire soon and the training and hiring of new employees could be improved. You get to work with great people and management can be hit or miss as there is a rotation or shuffling there every so often. Eastman could be the greatest at employee benefits and compensation but chooses to spend money on micro managing and marketing. The new safety campaign would have been well spent in employee bonuses for the record profits that continue rolling in. Everyone wants to go home safe please stop beating us over the head. Money is a major motivator luckily there is no competition here for Eastman to up the stakes."
good,Eastman is a good company to work for with a good upper management. Compensation is sometimes low. Eastman invests in it's employees and wants to grow employees.
good,Bulge bracket experience in foothills of Tennessee.  Leading North American Speciality Chemical company actively involved in growth projects both strategic as well as organic.

good,"pick up other peoples slack that happens at shift change.normal, im used to someone sticking it to me. because they know  i will get the job done regardless. its my baby after they go home to their families safely."
good,Each year benefits were taken away. Little chance of advancement without degree. Pay just enough to make leaving hard.
good,"There are many different jobs performed on a daily basis. Any and all Process and safety changes take far too long to be effective. The culture is very uncomfortable as the operations employees live in fear of losing their jobs. The management attitude reflects, ""We have plenty of people waiting at the gate to take your place."""
good,Eastman is a great company to work for but to me the cons out weigh the pros of the company its swing shift and you have to work alot of holidays. As a family based man i dont feel that i get to see my family as much as often when i have started to work with eastman.

good,HSES is less than strategic and difficult to enhance. Long term goalsare hard to get implemented.
good,When I Began in 2001 was excellent company to work for.  The culture has changed since lay-off where employees are not valued as before. Business Administration does not put employee business support staff as a vital role.

good,"I worked there as part of a co-op program through northeast state . I had to score well above average on the career readiness test and maintain a grade point average of 3.0 to even get to co-op status . After the one year co-op they may or may not have an a immediate position for you to fill , they did not in my case . I was called back for two interviews but was not selected . I believe that if you are a student not in your 20's or 30's you may experience the same . Just saying don't get your hopes too high ."
good,"Great colleagues and working team."
good,"If you're going to block wage promotions while giving titles that come with more responsibility, find a way to make it worth people's time.

good,"while benefits and vacation are robust, pay scale needs a lot of improvement, and management is weak and lacking experience. Too much trust placed in those without the proper senior level of experience to support and develop employees"
good,"Eastman was a great place, as an undergraduate student in chemistry, to gain insight into how the chemical industry functions and to observe some of the different jobs that are available in this field."
good,Either operating a distillation column or low pressure reactor from Delta V operating system in the control room.

good,"Eastman is an expanding company that offers a variety of different product lines. There is really not a typical day in my position, which allows for new opportunities and challnges on a daily basis. The hardest part of the position is trying to be creative and at the top of your game at all times becasue you never know when an issue will arise in the plant that will require your immediate attention. The most enjoyable part of my job are the new challenges that I encounter. My managment gives me the freedom to think outside of the box and to use my creative thinking."
good,More organizational skills needed! Have nothing else to say other than what i have posted!
good,"typical busy and slow periods to be expected in manufacturing, many opportunities to learn new things, management somewhat out of touch with regular Joe's but co-workers are always willing to help out, hardest part of the job is lack of understanding in other departments of what should and should not be done in our department, the most enjoyable part of the job is being a part of an internationally recognized company and being proud of our products"
good,My job demand to be careful in handling material of that type and look to make sure I was safe in during my job since I had to deal with some danger chemical at time. My job help me to keep than in order and placing things back where came. I learn to keep paper wrote of job well enough to tell what i done in the warehouse that day.
good,"kodak is fine to work for. They pay for your lunches, they give you free showers. They have good training ethics. Lots of chance for advancement. Good place to retire from."
good,Employees work as a team to make sure the jobs get done.  Management doesn't  really get involved unless we have an issue with shipments.

good,I was responsible for production of silicon department.  I also ordered chemical supplies.  I enjoyed my co-workers and the overall workplace culture.
good,I have no ill will toward Eastman. They just need to work on employee/employer relations a little bit. I was just a co-op. I did not have much say so with anything.
good,"Good place to work; but 12-hour shift is hard to deal with. The work load varies, but can be very stressful and demanding. Management is usually willing to work with you if situations arise and you need emergency time off."
good,Eastman is a great place to work with great people. There are many things to learn and people who are always willing and ready to teach. The benefits and pay are great for the area!
good,"When I first started at Eastman it was a great place to work. As the years passed by, it became increasingly stressful and benefits were cut. Upper positions were constantly be filled while lower positions back were being cut back."
good,"I was hired as an apprentice electrical and instrument technician and went through their U.S. Dept. of Labor certified program to become a journeyman electrical and instrument technician. I worked here for over twenty years and gained a broad range of experience working on anything from outdated pneumatic to state of the art electronic PLC,DCS, and control systems technology. Management was okay but could show favoritism on occasions. Workplace was okay depending on the operating unit you were working in at the time. The hardest part of the job was working around some of the equipment which had to run at high temperatures to operate/manufacture products while wearing fire retardant clothing, particularly in the summer months."
good,A typical day working at Eastman is fulfilling and rewarding.  Working  here makes you feel important and part of a team.  The coworkers are great and always ready to lend a helping hand.

good,Very well managed chemical company with excellent opportunity for learning and advancement. Very nice personnel to work among in fast-paced environment.

good,"Good place to work."
good,"Management and coworkers genuinely care about your personal safety, and place the safety of workers and staff above production; we have regular “safety huddles,” safety meetings, PPE is provided and very easily acquired if not readily available."

good,Altijd hectisch en nooit saai.
good,"Process  operations was ever changing with the changes occurring throughout the plant. We had to constantly monitor what process water was coming our way at different lift stations in order to be prepared for upsets. There was always something to learn. We all had to be capable to handle four different positions once work started. We, as operators, learned troubleshooting and team work was the best way to handle these upsets. Management was always around when most needed and co-workers jumped in any time there was a need. Eastman has many different process plants and each one could send us a different problem. I had to have some process knowledge of each and respond accordingly to each situation."
good,"I typical day at work is maintaining high quality product, for the customer whilst working in a very safty concious environment. The management leave us to manage the job ourselves and have a lot of trust in myself to do the job."
good,Depends on where you end up and who likes you one person not liking you can keep you from getting a job. Lots of politics family is a big way to get hired on with this company.
good,"My career at Eastman Chemical Company has been very fulfilling and promoted throughout the years.  Jobs are now being moved to outside the United States, forcing current employees to search options within and outside the company.

good,Pay is amazing!  Can be difficult to get along with so many different personalities working 12 hr shifts.  Poor management choices by hr. Great benefits
good,"Typical work day started with searching information (SharePoint sites, email, texts, etc.) outlets and reviewing longer range plans to determine focus and where progress needs to be made.  You will typically have multiple focuses depending on your job responsibilities.  Responding to emergencies is not the norm, but you must be rearrange if they happen.  Diligence is a prized attribute on most jobs. "
good,"Ok place to work,very long hours and  days. Would like to work Mon-Friday 8hr days."

good,"loved my experience while I got to complete my internship, great work environment, friendly people, lots of room for improvement"
good,The lab is a fun place to work. It is fast paced and there is never a dull moment. New products are coming through the lab all the time and it provides an opportunity to learn about all the newest innovations in chemicals manufacturing.
good,"While working at Eastman Chemical Company it gave me the opportunity to travel to black colleges in North Carolina and talk to students about working at Eastman Chemical Co.  The training was 1 year long which prepared us for the opportunity to become successful within our territories. There were 4 people in the training class and we bonded very quickly. Upon completion of the training we were sent to different parts of the country. I was transferred to southern California which I loved, except for the traffic, it was brutal."

good,It's a productive place to work with chances for advancement. A very safety oriented place to work.
good,Great benefits and 401K the company will match up to 50% of the first 7% that you contribute to your 401k.  All in all great company to work for I have really enjoyed it; just some management fairness is a issue.
good,"The most satisfying aspect about the internship was the collegiate work environment, and the people I have interacted, and the encouragement received."
good,Very good work culture. Everyone is friendly and willing to help you. Does not do a great job at career developement - things either move very fast or very slow in that regard.

good,"Eastman is a good company with collaborate culture. Every day I come to work expecting a fruitful day - learn new things, support coworkers or seek support from them, and make decisions on my products."
good,The company as a whole is a great place to work. The IT department is lagging when it comes to advancing technology.  More time is spent considering what could happen instead of ever taking action.
good,Great pay and benefits. Rotating shift work. Start out at 22/hr. Management is all about politics and who likes who.  Target will be on your back if youre not liked above everyone else.

good,• Analyzing the specifications provided by the functional consultants.
good,"I have found that the longer that a person works for a company, the excitement of the company dwindles.  Eastman was a fantastic company to work for when I began there.  As the years passed, the benefits changed and conditions changed.  Especially after Eastman Chemical split with Eastman Kodak.  There was more employee recognition, etc. prior to the split.  After the split, the employee was considered just another hand.  My immediate supervision was very good, but upper supervision were aloof and non-caring of the employee."
good,"Ik had wel een leuke ervaring as Credit assistance in Capelle."

I learned a lot; mainly, how to perform Life Cycle Assessments, improved technical report writing skills, improved presentation skills, gained knowledge of the chemical industry and various processes. My co-workers were friendly, hard-working, driven, and helpful. The management was wonderful at leading and growing us. They let us do our work with minimum supervision and monthly meetings to discuss progress. The hardest part was accurately accounting for all the inputs and outputs of a process to assess the environmental impacts. The most enjoyable part was the feeling of accomplishment after completing a Life Cycle Assessment project."

I don't think my body will ever adapt to rotating shifts.The most pleasurable part is after a 46 hour batch,getting lab results telling me the batch is in spec,no adjustments needed."
good,Very safe and team oriented company.  Great company to work for and learned a lot about the process operator position with the company.
good,"Since my employment I have been at the same position and no bid's in house to advance my skills. I like to learn and advance. I am a very hard worker, dedicated and punctual. I like the hands on work and work very hard to get my detail done."

good,"It was very difficult to get hired at Eastman in their Business Support roles. Not many negative things to say, but once you are selected, be aware that some positions are more difficult to advance from than others, as they are lacking in a direct advancement path. Operators and Engineers seem exempt from this."
good,"18 and a half years speaks a lot about the work place in a positive way !"
good,"Here at Eastman I have set scheduled breaks, there are three. We do a lot of scanning and labeling through out the course of the 12 hours. Everyone I work with are excellent workers we stay caught up."
good,"work 12 hour shifts"
good,"Family oriented.  Eastman is a work together company, A typical work day consisted of team playing. It was very obvious that motivating resources is a way to gain production.

good,Good job with good benefits.  Have enjoyed working there for 25 years and enjoy my co-workers and my job.  Have learned a great deal during my tenure and will forever be thankful for my job.
good,"This company is large and successful and always striving to be the best at what it does. It is also a coveted place to work regionally because the salary is quite high, and the benefits are well above average. In general, managers are engaged with employees and have a personal stake in the individual successes of their people. One of the greatest detriments to this otherwise outstanding company is its overabundance of upper and middle management. Directors are often so far removed from the day to day of their own departments that personnel feel abandoned. Upper management is ridiculously top heavy, which shows a lack of reasoning for a company that is striving to be competitive in a niche industry. There is also a frustrating fascination with outside consulting firms. At times, it seemed as though every problem was farmed out to expensive firms with scant knowledge of the human resources they already had at their fingertips. More reliance on the very skilled teams that were already employed by this Fortune 500 company would be a much better investment in the company's future."
good,We buit two stock rooms at two different sites.  I creat the partnumbers and nomiclature to go with item as well as putting them in location through the SAP system. I also negotiated pricing and put items on an outline agreement through the SAP system. I managed all inventory through the SAP system.

good,Good working invirorment . Kingsport TN. Is a great place to work and live. The people are good 👍 the town had great places to eat lots of fun working there was good but the job didn't last long.
good,"This would probably be the perfect job if it was not for working shift work and most holidays.  The pay is more than fair, and the benefits are above average.  The only other negative is the amount of time it takes to advance in your career."
good,The only reason I left Eastman is because I didn't have ample childcare.  The pay and benefits were excellent.  I would highly recommend this company.
good,Eastman is a very fast-paced environment.  They have a team-oriented environment.  Employees are encouraged to have a strong attention to detail and a positive attitude.

good,"In a limited service capacity, I get paid well above average with chance for full time. The work is hard, depending where you are assigned but for the area, you are compensated well and the bosses I've had so far tell you what and how to do it and let you do your thing."
good,"Overall, an awesome company to work for. All companies have their pros and cons, but I thoroughly enjoyed my time here! I would recommend this job to anyone looking for a full time position or a good starting job that will be a great resume builder at the very least."
good,"Although there is a grave disparity between the corporate area and factory area, Eastman as a whole has state-of-art facilities and the most kind and supportive people. Eastman has an organized chain of command that values efficiency and professionalism. Eastman employees are willing to help others even if it means spending extra time. The hardest part of the job was trying to learn the topic of the project during the first few weeks, but my manager and the people in my area helped me learn through hands-on and textbook work. I learned many engineering skills including LabView and Microsoft Excel programming as well as organizational and communication skills through various presentations and meetings."
