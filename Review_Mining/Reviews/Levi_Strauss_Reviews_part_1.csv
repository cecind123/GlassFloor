bad,Don't ever work here. Management is horrible. They can send you home every day with only 4 hours a day. They talk to you like your stupid and beneath them. They don't even follow the contract.
bad,"You never get  raise, the managers act like they care but when you need something they don't do nothing to really help. Hours are not too good and managers are not either."
bad,"si no eres amigo de alguien no creces o te hartan..."
bad,Un horario muy poco estable y mal ambiente de trabajo
bad,"My location (Miami Dolphin Mall) was horrible. The general manager was very unprofessional, would constantly display rude behaviour, and has the charisma of a wet sock. She would yell at her employees and talk down on them. Overall very low pay, very childish environment and abusive managers. AVOID AT ALL COSTS"
bad,Ils virent les gens pour rien a la tête du client des malades mentaux rongés par le travail alors que c'est une marque qui génère du chiffre facilement
bad,I was new to the area and previously worked as a stock associate for another company and  figured since Levi’s was hiring it to be a perfect fit and fortunately it was terrible coming into the store nobody introduced themselves everyone was very unfriendly and just staring management was very poor here and no one knew what they were doing and they literally had me covering what everyone else couldn’t do when originally I had applied for stock associate adding to the stock associates were not too friendly either and would be so rude
bad,I was only offered 10-15 hours weekly. The days I was supposed to work I would get calls saying not to come in due to over hiring. I did enjoy meeting new customers.
bad,Die Arbeit hat mir sehr gut gefallen Freude bereitet konnte gute Erfahrungen sammeln bin selbstbewusster dadurch geworden nette Kollegen gehabt viel Arbeit und trotzdem immer wieder gelacht am liebsten habe ich Kunden beraten
bad,yeni açılan mağazalarında çalıştım ve satış birincisi olmanıza rağmen sadece bir ay olmadığınız için işten çıkaran bir firma yönetim deseniz berbat kariyer derseniz yerinizde sayarsiniz siz elimizden gelenin en iyisini bile yapsanız bir şey olamıyorsunuz çünkü yöneticisini dışardan alan iğrenç bir firma bir de çalışana değer veriyormuş gibi bir slayt izletirler ama bunu hiç bir şekilde uygulamazlar özellikle bölge müdürü diye sedat diye biri var o işten anlıyor gibi gözükür ama hiç bir şey bilmez yüzünüze başka arkanızdan başka konuşur is yapmayanlar çalışır yapanları ise gönderen nezaketsiz ve iğrenç bir firma .
bad,"Needed a good job (ASAP) went through a temp service to get hired in at Levi Strauss. (Biggest mistake I've made.) They treated me just like I didn't belong there and pushed me out in less then a year.  I was not aloud PTO, so I couldn't and didn't miss a day of work and was never late. But because I went through a temp job company they cand me soon as my contract time was up. "
bad,"No recognition,  Upper management is disorganized,  Overall this company really left a bad taste in my mouth.  They helped build and renovate a multi-million dollar stadium while giving its employees minimal raises and starting most low end employees at minimum wage.  even if your store is beyond profitable compared to others in the company, within the highest margins of the company.  you can miss one month to plan out of a year and be treated like an absolute failure!  the training programs are disorganized and personally i was looked over for promotions several times given a pipe dream of opportunity.  I love the brand but from an internal perspective I would never work for this company again because of their lack of empathy and respect for their employees."
bad,"Poor management, company was mismanaged and closed.  Busy store in Sunrise, Florida, great for potential sales, but not enough staff or security to maintain merchandise from being stolen."
bad,the employees were people who peaked in high school and never learned how to be a descent person. Everything there was drama and nobody was professional.
bad,Working here was a bad thing for me. I needed certain days off told them weeks in advance and still insisted that I work when I said i couldn't. Yelled a lot. hated it here
bad,"The entire management team is racist, they pay you little to nothing and the discount is a disgrace! The Associate where wonderful to work with though. The district manager was rude the store manager was racist the supervisors were racist and clueless. Don’t waste your time even applying if you didn’t do stock you got 4 hours a shift and two days a week being paid 8.75$ ."
bad,"Its a tough one because I loved the environment of the staff and customers but at the end of the day even if you work your butt off you never felt appreciated, your work/sales are never good enough. Everyone becomes viscous for sales and it's not teamwork. I've never felt so useless and walked on by a company. Very sad management and atmosphere thanks to the owner. Very poor hours for full-time and part-time. Never consistent."
bad,"Levi's was not my environment, it was drama oriented and more. It was not a work place where it was professional and hours were not distributed in such way it would be fair for othe employers"
bad,spent 8 years with the company and not once have i ever decided to return. the job was stressful and i was not happy with the hours and forced shifts i had to work that were mandatory. i sometimes had to work over 14hr shift for 7days straight
bad,"Everyone's experience with this employer is different. Some love it and stay for 20+ years, some leave after their first week. Like any other job, you get out of it what you put into it."
bad,The management when I worked there were horrible. No communication at all. You get in trouble for every little thing. The management favor certain people. You don't get recognized for anything you do. Don't waste your time with this company.
bad,Management treats you bad especially if your a high school kid. They give you terrible  hours and talk down to you. No training for sales positionions. The pay was good.
bad,"Typical day would be a 4 hour shift with a 10 min break. "
bad,this is a place i did not find a good fit for myself i had worked for this company for 3 years and did not find time to familiarize myself with the company in itself but more with the product in itself.
bad,"Got hired here, and thought it was going to be  great!!!!!! only to work there for a couple of weeks and they fired me for being pregnant!!!!!!"
bad,"awful place to work would not recommend to anyone. awful management. hated working here, staff members were okay but management at the time was awful"
bad,"A typical day includes baby sitting sales associates that would rather be goofing off instead of working, guest service, operating cash register, merchandising the sales floor, processing shipment, setting promotions, cleaning out the fitting rooms and anything else that comes up throughout the day."
bad,"Flex pac is not the greatest job the expectations put on new employees is ridiculous, they want to write you up for mistakes on your first day I think they get off on it! No safety program in order They don't want or care if employees try to be successful in their job. You have to work your butt off and the hours are not bad start time is a bit to early and they give you no warning for overtime. Most of the people are nice, some have been working there 20,30 even 40 years! It kind of feels outdated. It's hot, dirty and boring! I'm very disappointed in the company! Not for me just staying till I find another job."
bad,"This place is literally a sweat shop just with better wages than an actual sweatshop but not by much.  "
bad,Management breaths down your neck about quotas which are unrealistic at 90 boxes an hour for picking and 200 boxes an hour for putaway. Putaway boxes range for 30-50lbs. They pay just above minimum wage and wage progression sucks. One guy had been working there for 5 years and was only making 15$ an hour as a machine operator. Killed myself just trying to make minimum quotas. Everyone hates one another and is out to get one another. all together a toxic work environment.
bad,"The staff was little snotty with the seasonal employers, they didn't welcome us like family. we had worked long hours having to deal with bad customers but it wasnt worth the pay!"
bad,"rude management; new to retail, they barely trained me and then yelled at me when i didnt know how to sell the way they wanted me to."
bad,"Very technical work place , Learnt lot of Denims and washes . Excellent team  co ordination and firm support from management in decision making. Very skilled environment which makes us to learn lot about garment technicalities."
bad,"Crew Work, Customer Service, Food Prep."
bad,Do not work here unless you are in high school and need a little extra cash in your pocket for the movie theater. Adults are in no way shape or form going to become productive with this company at all.
bad,the management team has no respect for the workers they dont care about staff only for there stupid jeans if u see a sign for hire run the other way its only good for there 40% discount
bad,Inconsistent work never get a full paycheck Management treats employees unfairly they have no formal training in management
bad,Very low pay. Most of the time minimum wage. No room to advance. Somewhat discriminatory management.
bad,Stock room was chill at times. You can interact with your co workers. sensoring is an annoying task but the rest is pure folding jeans.
bad,"No saben trabajar como grupo. La que va de “líder” de Madrid lo único que hacía era irse 5 veces a tomar café. Era una tirana y encima abusaba del poder que tenía para amenazarte con que habría cambios si no se hacía tu trabajo y el de ella. El area manager de Madrid un títere de ella y en las visitas no hacía nada. Una gran decepción por la q aposté y de la que no aprendí nada, bueno si... a no ser jamás como esta gente."
bad,"Imagine working for a company for many years, giving exceptional customer service, absolutely no customer complaints, and giving your all, only to never get recognition you deserve, never get a raise, and never get any kind of advancement. That was my experience working for Levis for many many years. If you like getting mistreated like a disposable SLAVE then this is job for you!"
bad,"The management here at levis is garbage. They don't treat you like a human being they treat you like a tool. They expect you to come in here 7 days a week mandatory OT, and not get upset."
bad,"Management is very bad of levis. Creating unnecessary pressures on staff for sale ."
bad,The associates on the warehouse floor make about $10/hr and if you work 2nd shift you are forced to work OT up to 72 hours per week for 60 days straight. They have zero ethics and show favoritism constantly. They will hide write ups for those they like until its too late to give it to them. No office etiquette if you work within the office. And if you cross them they will make it their mission to fire you so you cant get unemployment.
bad,"The company culture is not what it appears to be. On the outside Levi’s seems great and supportive with social causes, but internally  leaderships message is all about the bottom line."
bad,"As a warehouse worker, the warehouse itself was very dirty, and in y opinion very unsanitary and unhealthy.The management is not friendly, and to them, your just a number. In my experience, You can work your butt off all day and still not get hired on to the company. Something seemed really fishy about this place, and the hiring situation itself."
bad,"The supervisors and ASM here are a joke and very lazy, Working with the regular employees is nice even though you get yelled at for talking to your co-workers. If they fired the entire management team it would be a whole new work environment.(TimeSquare NY) The management only care about making their hourly bonus. (Which they get commission for making the hourly goal.) Meaning we the regular employees work hard for them to get those fat paycheck while we get 20 hours spread out through two weeks at minimum wage(NO added bonus ,no bigger pay,NOTHING) I guess this is retail but there is definitely a problem at that location. The managers are friends who worked together at different stores and so this make it a comfortable place for them to do as they please and treat the regular employees like pawns. If you dont like them you will be fired."
bad,Hours are bad and management needs a lot of work. Management is poor and company doesn't car about their employees. Long hours and sometimes 7 days a week for months.
bad,Nothing is written down at the job. Everything is word of month or outdated instructions that don’t apply to any job. Top 5 list of worst organized jobs I’ve ever had. No modern ways of advancement in the company. Constant layoffs every year.
bad,Not a pleasant atmosphere. Had to constantly clean up and puck up after patrons that were not courteous and made a mess put of the store. Careless clients
bad,Unless you need money badly I would not recomend this company. You can be required to work over 75+ days with no day off and the management is not engaged with any of the processes that are necessary to be involved in. This company will require you to be an absent minded person to all things non-Levi.
bad,The management here in the Bay Area is trash. District Manager is horrible. The current store I am with is horrible. The new management is horrible and unorganized. Promotions in the company is stupid.
bad,"It was more of the workload and low compensation as well as poor management that made me leave, my coworkers made me want to come to work but the management sucks and the amount to which they want one person to do with the pay they gave me was ridiculous, alllll that work for that little pay, I think not. They would have one person working in a section (walls + tables + helping the customers out and occasionally jumping on the register) and if you've been in Levi's you know those walls are no joke, by the time I got into work they were destroyed along with those tables and me, one little person, would have to spend the entire night folding all those jeans, all those shirts and having to assist customers on top of that. Plus they wouldn't even train the new employees so then that leaves me to pick up their slack and we'd be in there til sometimes 2 or 3 in the morning and have to come back again the next morning to open."
bad,"Positive - Good compensation, very competitive salary and great benefits and perks."
bad,Manage is awesome in Camarillo but hours are limited and you do have to make quota sales. You always work holidays and it is regular pay. You would have to have another job because if you have bills. This job would most likely not be enough
bad,"Pay was average, visual boring with minimal changes To keep up with trends. Struggle to maintain with budgeted hours, high unattainable goals. Favouritism within the company only if you worked higher than expected hours. No live life balance. American mentality as it's an American company. Company does not treat you like a human they treat you like just another number just to drive sales to make them richer."
bad,"Management is cut throat;  Work environment is not based on quality of work but personal preference."
bad,"Great clothes, but a depressing place to work. "
bad,"No the great company they want every one to think they are, no advancements. Work 10-12 hr shifts daily with no days off(rarely). They offer insurance but starting pay is minimum wage (8.50). Be prepared to never have a life, they work you almost non stop. Never make plans for a weekend or vacation you won't get to go cause you will be working. It's either you work non-stop or barely making ends meet. Don't expect to be rewarded for your hard work, you're just a number. Show up for work faithfully will not get any if little recognition they don't care. Husband has been there several years knows how to do almost every job in the warehouse, he should have a supervisors position by now but nope. There is no room for advancement just do your job. I no longer pay for any of their products. Yes they give back to the community but don't expect time off for any of it."
bad,"For the Henderson, NV distribution center:"
bad,"Levi's don't really train the new employees, the new employees kind of just go with the flow. When you are called into work you are lucky if you get to stay the whole shift."
bad,As it was only a two week placement I was treated very poorly by the manager who tried to take advantage of me being there.
bad,"Classic American corporate ladder where those higher up only get there by exploiting those below them. Worked at the location with the highest traffic in the area, but was given the same level of support as a store a fraction of the size. They would cut hours and then complain when others went into overtime to cover the unparalleled workload. I got a written warning for ""not smiling enough"" as I tried to take on the workload of 3 people."
bad,They threw me in there with no direction and guidance. I grew and learned  because of my will and desire to. Then they threw me out. Live and let die.
bad,"I was only there for a little over a month. After awhile I started to realize some things about the way they managed the place. My hours and shifts started off great. Then they started hiring more and more girls. (Which they only hire girls and not guys) I started realizing my hours being cut. They don’t communicate with you if you’re doing something wrong, They’ll just cut your shifts and won’t bother saying anything. My shifts were ALL cut and given to new people who weren’t even done their training yet. The key holders were very unprofessional and talked badly about most of the employees. With that being said, my over all experience was a very negative one. Loved working with the girls but couldn’t handle the amounts of disrespect and feeling like you’re not good enough for them. If you’ve worked here, I’m sure a lot of people will relate with me.. especially since their employees all are stressed and scared they’re going to get cut for nothing. Definitely needs better management and respect if they want to run a proper business."
bad,"Nope, would not recommend them to anyone. They over hire, give people sporatic schedules. Give me a break, American Jean store, if they really cared about their employees they would pay them a decent wage. I won't buy Levi's again knowing what I know.  They haven't given a raise to me in over a year."
bad,Very stressful environment due to management pressure.  Heavy workload during close activities.  Little to no training.  Lack of structure in organization.
bad,This company is the worst company I have ever worked for. They only care about making sales and don't even care to pay commission or reward those who work harder than others.
bad,"My time working for this company was an experience. I learned a lot working for Levi Strauss. Moving up in the company was very easy, and I enjoyed every moment of employment here. The management team was pretty much organized. My co workers was very easy going."
bad,they fire you over things you cant control and dont give you an honest reason of why they fire people. They only give certain people multiple chances to make mistaes
bad,Bonne boite d'apprentissage de vente et de management mais très mauvaise boite au niveau des avantages sociaux et des salaires
bad,"I enjoyed working with the company, it was a great learning experience but I did learn a lot from the company and many of the people there taught me what I do know today and I do thank them for that experience."
bad,"Premesso che non tutti i negozi Levi's sono gestiti dalla stessa azienda, ma in queste situazioni dovrebbero controllare ciò che succede nel loro store. In questo caso mi riferisco all'Outogheter Retail:"
bad,"I worked here as a seasonal cashier. No managers train you for ANYTHING, only ‘leads’. There were too many that claimed to be ‘leads’ & managers that you didn’t know who to really ask for help or ANYTHING! I barely got hours and they had obvious favoritism towards the employees in college. They never even gave me my last check also! BEWARE. Please don’t waste your time."
bad,"This is an amazing brand but the middle and upper management are useless. The environment is very unprofessional and rules are applied or ignored as each individual sees fit. HR offer no support and are incompetent and inconsistent."
bad,"The job entailed inspecting packages from packing to insure the orders were correct. the percentage of packages checked depended on the time on the job per packer. First week hires required 100% auditing. During higher volume periods with many new employees, the work load was intense."
bad,"The worst company I've ever worked for."
bad,"Un ambiente divertente, giovanile e dinamico."
bad,It was a day shift work in which we learned about the selling skill and interaction with the customer. Learned about the management process and making staff love to work with a new passion and enthusiasm. Hardest part of the job is to make a loyal customer who would regularly visit the particular store and the lovely part was one can easily be smooth and make new good friends.
bad,Not much different than any other shipping and receiving place. Didn't learn anything significant. Didn't see much of management. Co workers werent all that great didnt talk much. the hardest part was that it was a very physically demanding job. the most enjoyable part of the job was that u got to work alone allot.
bad,"Union shop, majority of employees have been there over 20+ years, they run the show NOT MANAGEMENT, they are the union, your hard work is rated on a changing UPH, and to secure their jobs, you'll be given a choice to stay working in another position after they fail you in their priority PEOPLE and turnover rated coral called FLEXPAC: Of which you will volunteer to quit Levi because the UPH will be impacted by the trainers constantly saying LOG ON LOG OFF or just bothering you while your time is ticking. 8 weeks you have to learn Flexpac and in 8 weeks you'll be GONE! No one should apply here until the old blue bloods of Levi retire but that won't happen no time soon as they have generations  who work there: Mom Dad grandpa Nana girlfriend side chick and their babies. They really think this place is WILLIE WONKA CHOCOLATE FACTOR and as An UmPa LUMPA stay 20+ years they will inherit this company: GOOD LUCK!"
bad,"Levi's is a great company. I have always loved their product and what they stand for. I believe this particular outlet location does not follow the ""Levi's"" way. The management know what they are doing and they are good at increasing numbers in sales in all sorts of ways. It just makes me sad to see the blatent disrespect they throw at the employees faces. Speaking down to them (including myself) instead of constructive criticism. It is a harsh environment on weekends and major holidays. But that is to be expected with the large amount of foot traffic in the store. Selling isn't the issue. It's just the backlash and almost ""gossip like"" attitude the management tends to bestow on the lower sales associates."
bad,Boa só precisa melhorar um pouco mais  e um local ótimo de trabalho pessoas super legais gerente ótima pessoa
bad,"Loved working here for the most part, I loved the benefits and working with people. My only complaint is the management didnt really care about the workers. For example I overheard them talking behind our backs on multiple occasions. Good break lengths and a great job to start out at."
bad,"This was a job that was o.k if you like doing the same thing day in and day out,with no chance at all for advancement.I had worked there for four and a half years and out of 500 or so employees,only one moved up one step. This is o.k for some people,but I feel the need to have the chance to prove myself and have chance to advance with a company.I have done it before and plan on doing it again."
bad,El gerente y la subgerente se enojan con el personal por que no entra la gente a la tienda
bad,"This place use to be a fun place to work then management fell apart. They want to overwork you for 12.10 an hour, you have to be working non stop on your stock picker and apparently you are barely allowed to stop or you get a write up. This company needs to be sued for having a sweat shop of exhausted workers young to old."
bad,"At first, I felt good working in the store but that died down after the first three months. The shifts were annoying and some of the managers got on my nerves."
bad,The place was one of worst company's I ever worked for first off rumor is mngt are prier criminals & some X-Felons there favoritism an little clicks the environment is toxic lots of immature cowardly behaviors an the mangers being a bunch of #%^&* condone it. When I left I basically told them they where a bunch of jerks an was going to get a real job an I did if you don't want to make much money than it's the place for you.If I ever become a major share hold in Levi I will clean house for sure.
bad,"Esperienza deludente, staff non collaborativo, manager assenti, formazione nulla..pessima esperienza.. Non la consiglio a nessuno.. Peccato che per colpa della poca professionalità di alcune persone mi ritrovo a scrivere una recensione negativa.. Consiglio alle risorse umane di rivedere lo staff se vogliono raggiungere gli obiettivi. Zero stelle per levi's."
bad,i felt i was getting paid very little for all the duties and responsibilities i had. At times i would be the only person working while management and the other employees would be in the backroom.
bad,"A typical day at work would usually be really busy and fast pace. We had to learn how to calculate the amount of time we spent assisting each customer, and also how to multi-task. That way we would'nt consume so much time on just one person and are able to assist a lot more people in our stations. Our managers were very lenient and understanding in some aspects, but were very serious on deadlines and organization. I loved every one of my co-workers ! We were very outspoken and comfortable with each other, and never hesitated to help one other out in any situation. Most of the time, the hardest part on the job is having to deal with rude customers. As polite and understanding as you try and be with certain customers, they would sometimes get a little ""pushy"" . But at anytime if I ever felt that a customer was getting out of hand, I would simply call over a manager and let them handle the situation. The most enjoyable part will forever be going on my lunch break :) ."
bad,i learned how to selll better how to bring a customer in and i worked great with alll co-workers
bad,"My hours are ridiculous, I'd get two weeks without a single shift. It's fun to work there and the pay is pretty okay, but they really can't hire so many people at once (currently 46 employees) and only have like 10 of us working for the whole week."
bad,"talk you up in interview  / orientation - real family like fun, cheery"
bad,"It is a union company, which is fine, but you are on the bottom for a very long time. The overtime and any promotions are based purely on seniority instead of capability of the job. They work overtime almost every week and if the people above you don’t want to work you get stuck doing it. The pay is not worth it. The only upside is the union protects you when you get written up."
bad,They have very little accountability terrible management procedures and processes and horrible communication methods internally. The need better aiT standards and processes
bad,"I worked for this company for over a year and went through a store manager transition. "
bad,If you badly need a job then go there but otherwise avoid if possible.  Wages are low and insurance  is unaffordable.  Higher management  push floor supervisors  to keep production up no matter what they have to do.
bad,I have added and gained experience on being focused on production on a daily basis. Therefore very fast and deadline driven environment. Always extremely busy.
bad,"long work days"
bad,"Good company to work with , lots of training programs for staff and managers.. outdoor activities and parties also...for refreshing.."
bad,"I liked working with my friends but my manager hated because I dated her son at the time so she gave me hell she did not like me one bit. I would come clock in and get yelled out for some one else is mistake when I would just show up. But other than that I clean did cashier, fold jeans restock."
bad,"Well I worked her as an Ladies bottoms, denim intern for two months. I was only given a spot boys job for a long time, bring carton boxes, arrange them on the floor. I was being told ""you're not good in illustrator"" Well I was a 3rd year student with no prior experience in the industry and i was one of the best in illustrator in my class. But i was definitely willing to learn if they handed me some work, which they wouldn't. "
bad,"My co workers was great but the store manager was a undercover evil person that only cared about herself  she always had a nasty answer whenever you ask her a question I quit after 3 months. "
bad,The job is easy and the employees are cool and nice but management sucks they can’t do nothing right they make you feel uncomfortable and try too push you your limit for a job that’s easy . The turnover rate is crazy there people get hired and will only last a month that’s how bad and annoying management is
bad,Çalışma saatlerinin yapılan anlaşmadan daha fazla olması
bad,If you are willing to do a basic job without hopes of advancement then it is okay. However once you get into the politics with the front office it gets a little intense and discouraging. It is a company that plays favorites and has no problem turning its head for those they like.
bad,"personel ayrımcılığın oluşu, maaş sıkıntısı, çalışma saatlerinin normalinden fazla olması."
bad,"their company OT didn't pay extra. They just paid rm 5 per hour."
bad,I worked to Levi’s outlet store in the Ontario Mills Mall for the Christmas season. It was the worst job I ever had. I was on call a good portion of the week and they expected me to put my life on hold till I had to call in for them to tell me that they didn't need me to work. As a cashier I worked close to management and saw how bias the workplace was. If they liked you they gave you work if they didn't like you then you did not work more than one day a week. While at work the seasonal employees where expected to always stay busy and find something to do while the other employees could just stand around and talk. The only good thing I got out of that job was how to keep my mouth shut and just do the work I was told to do and get some job experience.
bad,I hate feeling like I have to shove sales down customers throats. That type of behavior only makes people want to leave and I am constantly pressured by my leads to bother people even after they've clearly stated they are fine.
bad,I worked there for 2 months too long. Its a factory. I never knew if it was day or night outside. It's modern day slavery. The supervisor was terrible at training me on day to day basis.
bad,Not a fun job to work at for a long period of time. The managers has poor management skills on how to deal with its employees and run a company. Not a good place
bad,I wasn't here for too long. It was an uncomfortable and unfair work environment. I would never ever consider working for company again.
bad,Management allows union employees to manage the company.  No proper training for anyone.  Company needs complete restructuring from management to the floor personnel.
bad,"very little help from co workers and management,short breaks and stressful environment and the foreign customers do not make the job any easier"
bad,"I'm use to working for the government.  Ive work for the navy for 10 year and another 3 as a civilian and iv learned alot of professional traits that i think a multimillion dollar company would have also.  "
bad,The Eugene Servicing Center can be primarily characterized as a place that you will work long hours at. Wages are not competitive esp. after you weigh-in on your true 'hourly wage' when considering the 50 to 60 hours + you will be working. Ouch!
bad,"Meine Aufgaben waren"
bad,"I started in the fall of 2018, it was easy and honestly pretty fun. But once one manager left and another came it changed. There is short breaks, discounts that can range from 50% off one day to 10% off the next day. The management can’t even order water properly. They also push all of their work onto other associates and take credit for it. I was promised a raise at 6 months and it never came. The only reason I still work here is because it’s super easy and I don’t have a car so it’s close to where I live."
bad,"Es difícil evaluar ya que en aquel entonces era una franquicia y la tienda no pertenencia directamente a la marca."
bad,"Worked at Levis for almost a year. "
bad,Preconceito do gestor através de bullying e mais tratos. Chama as pessoas de idiota em reuniões. E outras coisas
bad,"being an assistant branch manager i ve learned how to make your operations smooth and work with scare resources. i ve learned how to break company goals into small chunks to meet them on time by using management by objectives approach. i have learned how to play strategically to increase your sales with controlled key performance indicators (KPI's) of the company. being a senior manager i have learned how to staff strengths to meet company goals. as far as workplace is concern, that was good but not like we see in Europe and north America. the hardest part of the job is company demands extra work time in same salary."
bad,"Mi experiencia profesional ha sido positiva en cuanto a mi propio desarrollo con mis equipos, pero la gestión en la empresa es mala ."
bad,"Worked there for over 8 years. Vary dangerous conditions extant fast paced. From going up and down laders to running lines it is hectic. Place is falling apart and no sign of it being fixed. The TS crew is forced to work every day anymore even holidays, worked this past Thanksgiving even (2018). If you don't have vacation time you do not get off at all. I would only recommend this job if you have no job at all and are needing to pay the bills while looking. The pay for TS is so low and insurance is high. Not worth the headache."
bad,"Levi's was one of the worst jobs I had ever had, would not recommend it to anyone. Although benefits were good, management and staff were not the best."
bad,"I loved the employees that I worked with. Very nice shop. I did learn a lot. However, no room for advancement and the pay unfortunately did not support my moderate lifestyle."
bad,"Forced overtime hours, a union that works hand in hand with management against the employees, and coworkers who find that the only means of advancement is to get you fired."
bad,"A good place for people fresh into the career world.  But unfortunately, the job didn't last since the dept had folded and was relocated to Arizona.  Odd thing was, as the manager had informed everyone of the shutdown, he also informed everyone that he received a promotion, while the rest of us were left looking for work elsewhere."
bad,"I have more then fifteen years experience in Retail and Management."
bad,Muy buena empresa a nivel nacional e internacional  buen hambiente laboral
bad,Great job to have if you are in highschool but don't think you'll be getting paid well for the amount of work you do. They keep track of your sales but it is only hourly with no commission
bad,"The Times Square location closes at midnight. If you're closing you stay until 2:30 am sometimes 3 to fix the entire store. Having been an employee for 3 years I can say that I was given the privilege to advance into three different positions, but with insignificant increase in compensation. Started as a PT salesperson and moved on to a Sales lead, then a Cashier lead, and then a FT Supervisor. I was only getting paid $12.95/hr - unacceptable given the title and the location. Communication amongst management is blurry most of the time thus causing tension amongst the team and making decisions on common grounds seems to be ineffective most times. I really enjoyed the people that I worked with, we were like family, but there is no life balance WHATSOEVER. Great company, but terrible in all other aspects. If you want to work for this brand DO NOT work at Times Square."
bad,"Ensured the store exceeded their KPIs ( unit per transaction, average dollar sale, average unit sale and customer conversions) on a daily basis."
bad,"I loved it there until management changed.  We went from a strong team, to divided co-workers.  Our managers would sit in the back all day and eat until they couldn't move.  They never understood that not everyone drove cars.  They literally fired everyone making more than $8 within 3 months of them taking over.  Those that did slip through were fired within the next 3 months off of ridiculous he say she say.  By the time anyone could catch what management was doing they had over 50 part time employees working less than 25hrs a week at $7.25."
bad,Not the best place I have worked. Very uptight. Always on edge.
bad,"i never thought i can hate a job, then i worked at levi's. horrible pay and management honestly at least is a job but that is it."
bad,"Levis’s quiere que vendas, vendas y vendas! más eso que no que seas simpática o agradable con los clientes. Palabras de la encargada de tienda. Demasiada exigencia para al final estar cobrando lo mismo que un trabajador de inditex, horarios supuestamente rotativos, una semana de mañana y otra de tardes eso siempre i cuando le vaya bien a la encargada y no te ponga 3 seguidas de tarde por que le va bien a ella...una porqueria de trabajo y por no hablar de todos los festivos trabajados en diciembre que te pagan la mirar en la nómina de febrero y las horas extras no se pagan, las devuelven en tiempo cuando les viene bien."
bad,"The store I worked at was so mismanaged and poorly run that it fell on the shoulders of 3/12 managers to carry the weight of the entire building. The company looks at associates as numbers in the system. Turnover is high, both in sales associates and management. I heard my DM say to myself and a number of associates “the jeans sell themselves, don’t worry about the customer”. I’ve never heard of a company whose culture didn’t revolve around great customer service."
bad,"I’d always receive negative feedback about little things, never good feedback for the good I did do. Favoritism was a huge thing at my location. Wasn’t really given a chance even after voicing my concerns (that just resulted in my hours getting cut up more and more until I decided I had enough and left)."
bad,"Management lacks the skill set to effectively manage people and delegate workload. The approach to coach the associates is more just pure criticism, micromanaged to the point that emails were proof read and edited before sending them.  The amount of workload and lack of resource combined with the ultimate horrific lacking of EQ skills what drove people away."
bad,The so called union is a complete embarrassment to the word union. Again management. Shipped jobs across sea you suck.....and every other company deserves everything you've coming. SCREWED the American people over for a dollar...
bad,"Honestly not the worst place to work in the retail game, just wouldn't recommend it for longer than a few months. Not worth the hassle and stress, the management lacks severely and never knew what was going on, and always in the back room messing around, seemingly never doing their job- just bossing others around. Also, managers would notoriously pawn everything off on the associates. And the GM only did her job when she had too and was at times extremely unprofessional."
bad,A lot of structural changes meant the business went from a friendly team environment to everyone out for themselves. It became very quickly a very stressful environment and I was happy when the redundancy came thru.
bad,I was once told by an employee in managment that if you want to make it up in the higher ranks with the company you gotta sleep with someone higher up. I felt loke i had a target on my back and the management here sarcastically compliments your job ethics.
bad,"i was paid 8 dollars an hour (no joke) to sell jeans that most places pay commission for. the management was awful, and not flexible with work schedules at all. yeah. its a hard pass for me."
bad,My manager at Levi Strauss was the worst example of a manager I've ever seen in my life. She was so lazy and would never pitch in physically - only verbally to tell you what to do. She would talk about other employees behind their backs and created drama everywhere she went. It was like working with high school students. I would never do it again.
bad,"The difficult thing is get along with colleagues. Because of commission, its strong competition with colleagues. Its make us always argue. The most enjoyable part is help customer tailor the jean legs."
bad,"As at most retail places, there are plenty of politics at Levi Strauss & Co."
bad,The start of the day would be to open the store and set up the signs. Then go over the store and make sure its clean. I would start by changing any signs that needed another promo poster in it. The next thing would be to set up new clothes and refold the ones that are already on the shelves to make it look nice and clean.
bad,"Wasn't to fond of the store manager, well... many people aren't that work there. There is also so much asked of you with very little in return."
bad,"This was my first hit at retail experience. The management changed so often that it was extremely hard to deal with all the new personalities. They didn't make much room for anything else to go on in your life, even as part time. The hours were horrible but the connection with co-workers were great."
bad,They don't give you much hours. You should get paid more for also being bilingual but you don't. Clothes are too expensive.
bad,i've been there for 3 years and i learned alot about products and multiples and average sales and how to multi task in every different way.we pick product and pack and label them and stock it for it to be shipped on time
bad,"They do not hire directly. They use a temp agency, promise you will get hired and don't. The security guards are another matter altogether. They don't speak English, will argue with you over minute stuff and if they feel you are a problem will tell your supervisor who then has the agency drop you like a hot potato without explanation or even a talk about what they feel is the issue. Not professional"
bad,"this was my friend job every while I was in high school and i have a lot to say. "
bad,Lay-off sucks but it’s a nice place to work the have some good work hours but they Dnt mind laying off but once’s you get in everything good so it’s a nice place to work
bad,"It was a fun couple of years at Levi's but there are many aspects of the company that could be better, especially with management. Our team consisted of multiple management positions that held no weight, poor interpersonal/communication skills, management favored employees who suck up to them and will give you poor hours if you bring this to their attention. Have I mentioned that you must adhere to the company policies on sales or management will breathe fire down your neck? Don't forget to tell customers to buy two jeans for a second pair that will only cost them $20 more, or else your job is on the line! "
bad,"The customers aren't bad, location is good, but the managers are bad. Hardly any communication between them. Scheduled me outside availability and if I told them it was and couldn't make it, either they wouldn't reschedule me or not take me off the schedule and I would get a call or text in the middle of class asking where I am. Managers would sit in the back for at least 30 minutes if not an hour or two a lot leaving me on the floor by myself, and one manager hardly did anything and gave me or other associates all the work he was supposed to do and would stand around working on one project for 4 or 5 hours that should have taken an hour tops. The managers aren't good they are friendly, but have poor time management and communication skills."
bad,"I left LS&co due to a hostile work environment. At one point in time it was my only job outside of school. When I got a second job due to the low pay rate my managers advised against it and went as far as voiding my availability and scheduling me for nonavailable hours. I had a supervisor shove me and another make sexually harrassing statements. Upon contacting corporate, they simply took down my statement and brushed it aside. I made great friends there. Management as just terrible and only cared about sales goals rather than employees."
bad,"Management make lots of rash calls and speak to part time staff very patronisingly whilst making shift changes very late therefore not giving notice to us. Furthermore would put you down for holidays just as haven't taken any in a while therefore when you do actually have a holiday apparently all hours have been taken up. Put down for overtime during exam season even though have specifically asked for no overtime."
bad,It was not very enjoyable. There was bad management. Too many workers and there was far too much stress for a job that only pays minimum wage. Wouldn't recommend.
bad,Bana is hayatinda cok onemli bi yer kazandırdi yalniz ozel hayat yoktu.
bad,"This location was very unorganized, workers were not happy to work which their performance poor. There was no advancement in this field and having to pick up other's slack"
bad,"Management very poor. Manager was rude. Managers were young, they had lack of experience. Unfair work load, some would chat on the corner (including shift supervisors ) while other associates would have a much bigger work load"
bad,"The company does not allow for forward advancement and does not compensate you fairly for your sales. There is no commision so even if you are the top sales stylist, you make as much as the lazy person who doesn't do anything."
bad,İlk iş deneyimim  bu şirket altında oldu o yüzden bana iyi be kötü anlamda çok şey kattı
bad,they say the care about you as a person but I don't feel they take the proper steps that they can to really be there. the training I had from higher up was always given in a rude way.
bad,Levi is more concerned about their public and social reputation than running an efficient facility -- Union rules the facility
bad,it was fine. It got very busy. They gave you a lot of hours. Good for what it is. I liked it overall it was in a bust area right in the woodbury commons
bad,"Colleagues were great and the culture was warm and accepting. There was no possibility for upward mobility."
bad,"typical day included processing shipment, marketing changes, and "
bad,"did a lot of selling to customers, helping customers find everything that they are looking for, greeting and smiling at every customer that walks thru the door."
bad,"Typically Levis was a laid back environment unless it was super busy, like on black Friday,or opening weekend. Being that it was an outlet mall, the weekends would always be somewhat hectic. I learned a lot of history about Levis. I learned about jeans, register, and stocking. The hardest part about the job was staying busy even when there was nothing left to do. I'd usually find myself refolding the entire wall. The most enjoyable part of the day would have to be break time. Simply because I would get toe at then explore the new mall."
bad,Nice and fun workers with great customer support.But the management is unprofessional and biased.
bad,"horrible employees and a manager that couldn't handle anything made the company really hard to work for, but the jeans are great though"
bad,"new Management was hired on as I started working as a part time after I was promoted from seasonal during the month of January 2019. I was excited since I was really enjoying myself but that soon changed as I got all my hours slashed and have been refused to be fully trained while new workers have been fully trained after a couple weeks, I’ve been working for them since November 2018. I’ve been made a fool and am regularly ignored by my manager when I contact her. And when I confronted her about my hours being slashed I was told that my performance was low and I didn’t work hard enough even know I always did what I was asked and some extra that wasn’t expected. Keep in mind my performance is locked to morning shifts for 3 hours when the store opens so I basically get zero chance to improve as a worker. I soon will be leaving Levi’s as sad as I am to do so but the managements treatment of me has be extremely disheartening and I refuse to be treated so poorly. If you want to work for Levi’s DO NOT work for south Edmonton common. You will most likely receive the same treatment."
bad,"Te culpan por todo lo malo que pasa, y lo bueno muy pocas veces se reconoce, no hay buena comunicado"
bad,"Most staff in the Swindon store were friendly and hardworking. Poor management, no room for progress when they hire new staff from outside the business and promises of training and progressment are not met."
bad,"Even though the job itself is not hard and you are fully trained, the management does not care about the staff at all.  Put you done for overtime and will not let you change it. Constantly changing shifts times last minute. Put you down for holidays if you haven't taken time off in a while and then refuses your actually holiday request. Do not believe you when you are ill."
bad,"non c'è possibilità di crescita "
bad,the store is now defunct. I don't know how the remaining stores operate so it would be unfair to judge the remaining stores based on my experience at a now defunct  store. I love levis products and they are still the best demin jeans in the world
bad,"Good first job for most people. You learn how to work in a team, how to keep things organized, learn basic customer service skills. How to read and talk to people of all kinds of backgrounds."
bad,A hard place to work if you are results/action oriented.  The organization requires one to spend more time getting others to sign off than actually accomplishing work that will achieve growth.  They are also known for hiring and laying off with headcounts just another number on the budget sheet.
bad,"Levis is a great global sales company where it is nice to work. You learn everything about sales, visual, marketing and general dealing with the public."
bad,Un vendeur chez Levi's ne vend pas par plaisir puisqu'il devient automatiquement une commerciale avec de lourdes pressions de vente sur son dos et considérant les clients comme de la viande fraîche et non comme un client important à l'enseigne. Je conçois que les chiffres sont importants au développement de l'enseigne ça va de soi mais de façon raisonnable. Bien que la plupart des vendeurs soient agréables les managers le sont différemment. Il s'agit cependant d'une très bonne entreprise pour les personnes recherchant de la vente à chiffre et non de la vente par plaisir de conseiller la mode aux clients. Technique de vente par mensonge aux clients et j'en passe. Malheureusement ce type de vente peut être retrouvée dans plusieurs enseignes de ce genre.
bad,"I was hired on the spot, and loved my job. I was part-time and promised at least a 10hr work week. within a month, my work week dropped to 4hrs. When many people quit, instead of spreading out the hours, they actually put an ad here to hire more people!! My coworkers are sweet and so are some managers, but the way they work our team is terrible."
bad,"Starting off this job was one of the most enjoyable parts; every shift for the first few months you'd be getting to know your co-workers, getting to know the product you were selling, and most importantly acquiring skills that range from customer service to shipping & receiving product. "
bad,While working at Levi's customer service and communication is key because you'll come across many different people who are interested in your store product and your only job is to upsell the company product to ensure your customer had a great experience
bad,"Great customers and product."
bad,"Same as previous LS&Co review. Same game, different location and just a step above the rest."
bad,"Long, boring hours.. this is why the location closed. Management promised advancement opportunities and didnt follow through. "
bad,This job has been nothing good for me. After two long years I have just finally received a raise. The managers are rude and talk behind their employee's backs. The shifts are short and the pay is little.
bad,so boring! all I ever did was fold clothes that didn't even need to be folded. it's so dead during the week too. You just walk around and do nothing... basically.
bad,"When I was hired, it was for black friday. They decided to keep me after that and I stayed until they got new managers. The new management changed everything around and cut many hours. I was left with 6 hours a week."
bad,"-Se aprende a ser buen profesional, con un minimo de interés, gracias a los compañeros y el día a día"
bad,My time there was bitter sweet. A lot of people have come and gone throughout the years but there are those people you connect and build bonds with. Especially with the stock team. You work there rubbing elbows because of how much you would work with one another.
bad,No pagan las nominas el dia correspondiente solo hay dos descansos al mes no pagan lo devido sino lo que les gusta  no pagan horas extras ni dominicales por ley .
bad,"very cultural company, you get to meet individuals from various countries and culture. customer friendly and knows how to put the customer first , focuses on customer engagment.  management is extremely pushy and enforces sales on customers"
bad,"Management as far as the Lancaster, CA location still needed a lot of improvements with; attitude, communication, work ethics, co-worker atmosphere control, and service before they were made part of management. Mostly speaking of store and assist manager. Other problems I seen were very bad practices of them that could potentially harm Levis & Co. legally."
bad,"I did not like working at levi's at ALL! It is more of a high school then a work place. too much drama and everyone is concerned with everything else but work. One thing i learned while i was there, is how to boost my sales and keep adding to the sales. co-workers gossip and do not know how to act. The most enjoyable part was talking to the foreigners. The hardest part of the job was knowing what size the foreigners were lol"
bad,"trabalho com alegria"
bad,"Hours were crazy, management very hypocritical great benefits and part time staff were great however did not get what they deserved in terms of praise."
bad,"A lot of drama, I don't think it's a good place to work . The only thing is the benefits, and they definitely give you great hours . But I would not recommend to work here."
bad,"Levi's provides a good environment for learning what the working world is like - with a strong emphasis on customer service, taking ownership of your decisions, and following through, Levi's helped to improve my interpersonal skills and management of challenges (from multitasking to working with difficult clients). Advancement is very difficult, especially in comparison to other competitors in the industry. Expectations are high, often unreasonably so. Oftentimes qualified employees end up seeking work elsewhere after waiting for significant time for recognition at Levi's."
bad,42nd is always a busy place so you have to know how to multitask with the different customers. i learned about all the types of jeans and how to measure for the right fit.
bad,A typical work day began with a check in about goals of the day as far as sales. I learned how to compromise with customers. We were taught to know about the sales going on at the time with the ability to answer any questions about merchandise.
bad,The store I worked at everything had to be perfect for the limited number of people that came in. Also I found out after I was hired that my job was seasonal so that was extremely annoying. I ended up either getting fired or quitting or something early because even though I said I couldn't work a specific day they still scheduled me to work and then my manager wouldn't email or call me back about the day even though I couldn't go in and see her unless I skipped school.
bad,"A typical day at work consist of promoting sales, and delivering great customer service. I learned the different styles, and washes of our products. Management was very upbeat and competitive, and co-workers were very friendly and helpful. The hardest part of the job was developing all the knowledge that was needed, with the lit of hours allotted. The most enjoyable part of the job was delivering customer service to the wide group of diversity of customers."
bad,Had to meet a certain number before they would hire you on most of the workers there have been there a long time and don’t like new employees their was a lot of drama brought on by old employees the management is involved in this as well
bad,"Levi Strauss in Gretna, NE was a very busy store. I would recommend this job to someone who is fast when dealing with many tasks and neat when doing so."
bad,The managers there were really shady and always causing drama.  They did nothing to fix the problems.  I got about 1 shift a week and I have been there for about a year.  I don't think I would recommend working here.
bad,Honestly I only stayed because I had no other choice at the moment and still had to search for a way better paying job. It’s not worth the stress for such little pay
bad,"Worked here for over 5 years but could never work here again. You will not receive any training, the mangers are the worst leaders I have ever encountered and they prevent any career or personal growth."
bad,"Great first job, ignore the snobby customers and remain polite and courteous. The hours were great! I loved the store manager, she allowed flexibility in my scheduled and put in a good word for my new job! I loved helping women find their ""Curve I.D"" and helping men shop was a breeze. I hit my sales goals (not harsh at all) pretty easily."
bad,It was so tiring I got promoted and lost my whole team do too corporate. It was a nightmare I worked like a dog and got no grattitude
bad,It is not a fun place to work with saftey health concerns and broken machinery that dont work. I thank them because I never would have went back to school to get my degree if the conditions were better.  No room for advancement and a lot of discrimination.
bad,"The work environment was very structured with no real opportunities to improvise.  At the beginning of a shift, the stock room employees were given a task and deadline for completion."
bad,"Working at Levi's was not my cup of tea. The vibe in there, from the associates to the customers was not as pleasant as I had hoped. I did learn to be more self motivating while working there."
bad,"When i worked at Levi i was a Sales representative on the floor and every morning all staff would gather around to discuss the new merchandise, sales and goals for the day. "
bad,This job was fair. At times it can be boring but there was always customers in the store because of where this store is located at.
bad,This job was right after High school so at the time it was great fun place to work
bad,"It was a fun place to work, until management changed and things went down hill."
bad,Working at Levis was very pleasant as we worked as a team. Helping out the customers is number one.
bad,Exciting workers and customers.
bad,The management was very unprofessional and rude with both customers and their employees. The void between management and the rest of the employee's was very clear.
bad,"A typical day at work was helping guests find their right size and what fits them best, also maintaining a clean and orderly work place."
bad,"I got into this job as a favor for a friend who was the manager and ended up leaving due to difficulties between the two of us, personally.  It was nothing against the store.  A lot of hard work."
good,"Checked in and out patients worked with 6 APN scheduled Procedures and Test .Insurance Pre authorizations. scheduled large volume patients for  cancer infusion appt,"
good,"Upon working at the Tailor Shop, management failed to both compensate promised pay-rates/benefits, as well as job security. As well as using several employees as scape goats for management's personal agenda. "
good,"in the beginning of working here i loved it the staff and the management were amazing, i learned very quickly and began to pursue on being more than an associate so i began working hard to grow withing the company and a new management team came in and it wasn't the greatest, there demands were just way too much for this type of store, the management team was rude but very unprofessional"
good,"Got hired for seasonal, not a hard job, folding and processing clothes, putting clothes on the floor"
good,They keep on forcing their staffs to reached target for every weekly.20% staffs discount are reasonable for the staffs to buy their own jeans and other products.Free working outfits
good,"Working at Levi’s was very relaxing when there was not a rush but even with a rush it was still fun to work there. I was not given hours which made the reason being for me to quit, I was only given a  4 hour shift one day a week."
good,"Start time is at 6am to 2:30pm, Group meeting in the morning to see what duties you are giving. I learned that the harder you work the less the company does for you,mandatory OverTime almost everyday,If you don't show up....your fired. Management is ok, if you like being yelled at all day long. the work place itself is a warehouse lol, air conditioning one million square foot place its huge. Hardest part of the job....is working with people that make your job harder.Enjoyable part....is when you work with people that can make your day go by so much better than the people that dont care about there job."
good,folding clothes cleaning   customer service cashiering  ect
good,"I sold a lot of pants here, i made the company a decent amount of money here."
good,While working their we tried the whole fun environment thing. But it always didn't last long. I barely worked hours I was on call every other week just like a lot of other teen workers whom worked with me at the time. Hardest part of the job was getting the jeans on the 4th shelf (laughs to self) because there was an two step ladder.
good,I worked Tuesday and Thursdays. I learned how to be a very good salesmen. the managment was young so we had alot in common. my co-workers were super nice to work with. the hardest part of the job was dealing with rude people. what i enjoyed most on this job was communicating with costumers and finding out their style of fashion
good,"travailler pour un franchisé peut poser problème, la hiérarchie a été sans foi ni loi"
good,"The job itself is easy and a good environment to work on your skills, but the management team is horrible. There are never any chances to advance to a higher positions because the management team will make a decision before letting the staff know of the opening. Every employ is paid a completely different pay rate, despite the amount of time you've worked there, just know what you're being paid is not all they can offer you."
good,Low pay and no available hours. Worked 1 day. Took 2 weeks to be put on schedule again. Worked about 4-6 hours a week. Pay was min wage. No normal person can make a living at Levis unless you are FT.....which they don't hire for.
good,Dpes not give enough training. Expects staff to understand. Not enough staff on floor to assist customers on busy days. Expected to do s much. Management steals money from cash and from xustomers that left wallets behind. Sketchy.
good,"When i first started working there i enjoyed it, but the hours really did suck and so did the pay. I loved everybody i worked with and i loved 3/4 managers."
good,"i think this is a great place for any new high school grad to get some work experience but definitely not the place to stay. When i worked there, my team was actually a family. it made it easier to come into work and deal with the annoying customers. dont stay stuck here though. go, get your experience for about a year or two and get the heck out lol"
good,"Employees would work together attempt to reach sales goal of the day. Mainly tourists visit the store I worked at. Majority of the time, the business seems pretty slow, except for holidays of course. Not much to do but fold and organize stacks of clothes, and to retrieve them for customers when need of assistance."
good,"you learn how to perfect fold jeans, fold shirts perfectly. must be perfect or you must refold all over again. perfect close every night which means all the walls must be PERFECT!"
good,we had to come in and was only able to stay in a certain section even if someone needed help elsewhere we were not allowed to leave that area They made us compete with coworkers to make sales
good,"muy buen ambiente de trabajo el trato de mis jefes excelente, muy amables mis compañeras de trabajo de igual manera muy buenas personas"
good,DRAMA!!!  if your looking for a part time summer job then this place is great. I would not make a career out of it. Management was very hard to work with. co workers didn't care about the look of the store or customers. and lots of gossip and drama between co workers.
good,The flagship store in downtown San Francisco is always busy and there was never a dull moment. There are tons of jeans that need to be constantly refolded throughout the day.
good,"slow days with very little customers, and wasn't feeling like i was being used to my maximum potential. nice friendly workers"
good,"The people I work with are great and hard workers, I love that they are receptive to contructive critisim. The store is currently under new management so everyone is adjusting."
good,I didn't have any issues working for Levi's except for the fact they shut down.
good,Levi could be better if they put right ppl n the right positions. To disorganized at times. No true communication between the staff. Everyone telling trying to get favours and they letting go the good workers just bcuz they may not like tht person....
good,"Ok place to work. Can be hectic with hours that seem long. Management is a joke. but the people I worked with were nice. Production numbers are manageable, however advancement opportunities are small."
good,"Worked here for just over a month in a store that had just opened up. Everything started okay, seemed like store was going well until suddenly it wasn’t. Management kept blaming the part timers for not meeting sales targets in a consistently empty store. Would set us ridiculous sales targets and most times we wouldn’t make £2000. All management was young, none over the age of 30 so there was a lack of maturity and nasty attitudes from management. Hours could sometimes be ridiculous as was organisation. "
good,"Great company that stands for good intentions.  Unfortunately, very limited resources to be successful.  Leadership team is full of good managers, but terrible leaders.  Lack empathy for employees and work environment that has been created."
good,The only good thing is when they give extra hours for firing everyone else. Many things are broken that we use to work with and no one works hand in hand besides the employees trying to leave after trying to repair a store that had no effort in it through your the day
good,"The main point of the job at Levi's, if you do not sell a lot, even if you are close to your quota, you get no hours or even fired. There is some favoritism going on in the store between employees and the manager. Hours get cut often and store is often empty."
good,"A empresa tem uma qualidade inigualável relacionado a qualidade dos jeans."
good,"The store started as a great place to work, until our first manager was fired.  From there, everything declined to poor moral."
good,"the best part of levis were my coworkers everyone pretty much got along and spend time outside of work, we also got along with most of management there were never any serious problems. we worked together to help our customers , only real problem was the amount of hours that weren't available."
good,Always re-organizing the company so things change a lot.  Jobs are being outsourced to India. Good co-workers and enjoyed working with them.
good,Work days were very fast paced - always learning something new.  No job security and no real training - expected to know how to do thinks without being taught the proper process.
good,Working at Levi's I learned how to be more sociable with costumers and other employees. I also learned theirs sales and discounts. Organization was another thing i learned for working there.
good,"hi"
good,"I am not against people with seniority being promoted, but when you put a shared service center in the hands of people that have been there for a while and aren't qualified it leads to a poor place to work."
good,"Co-Workers seemed to all have the same personality and humor, not going to lie, it was a little weird. Overall average experience."
good,"INVENTORY MANAGEMENT,DIFFERENT Task, ,The most enjoyable part was the achievement of 3.35 lakhs in one single day with 1100 square feet store."
good,You need lots of patience for tourists to work here. Very busy and hectic during the busy seasons
good,"While it is a great company, the last few years have had high turnover in management, which makes career advancement difficult unless you are friendly with the right people. Many leads lack good management skills. While people come off friendly, the culture is quite competitive."
good,I work autonomously at Levi. My managers are hands off and are there when you need them.  The environment is very quiet and casual. Dress is jeans and tennis shoes.
good,Management was okay. The pay absolutely sucks and so does the hours. 4-5 hour shifts most days and at most 2-3 days a week. Barely enough to keep anyone afloat in today economy.
good,I was working two jobs at the time (Clinton housing). The hours wasn't bad but the responsibilities wasn't much either. When it came to growth and wages there wasn't much opportunity there also.
good,Good people good environment but needs better management and better trained employees. Needs to understand the concept of competing with pay. They will kick you out the door if you ask for more money .
good,"Levis was a good store from the moment I got hired. I learned alot of denim history while working for their company and all the other styles that customers love to look for and try on. The only downfall about the location that I work for, is that there is no equal opportunity for the ones that have been working there for a long time, including myself. I see no advancement to the ones that really want to grow within the company either."
good,A typical day consisted of the usual folding of clothing and talking with customers but my coworkers didn't seem to care and it made the job longer and harder
good,"Being a union shop, some shifts will actually work 60 to 80 hour work weeks. Mandatory overtime. Worklife balance does not exist for these people. The employees themselves are a great group of people. Management really has no care or concern about your family life."
good,"Highly intense responsibility - working on catwalks high in the air around moving conveyors.  Pay did not suit the risk. Not much interaction with other employees and uncomfortable working 8 hours a day on narrow catwalks."
good,Levi's is a very great company but I didn't get as much hours. I would only be working 4 hours and sometimes I would be sent home early.  When i worked there i only worked like 3 days
good,"Very High stress and paced work environment. You will be exposed to many responsibilities, outside of what you were hired for. Management is goal driven. The hardest part about working here is the work life balance, short suspenses to get things done and management don't seem to care for their employees. They will take up for each other. The the organization backs their Sr. Managers. This isn't the environment you would succeed in if you have kids and a family. But you will enjoy the culture."
good,"It's customer service, what do you expect?  At my store there was no room for advancement and the job eventually gets boring.  If you get cool co workers you'll be ok."
good,"Everyday is pretty much the same unless you have time set aside to complete other tasks. Working for levi I learned alot about the back side of running a business payroll, profit & loss. Scheduling I am able to recognize and make any necessary changes to ensure business needs are still be met, all of my co workers were different in thier own way, I definetly learned from each and every one of them. Hardest part of my job at levis is being able to express your ideas and your ideas being taking intp consideration. The most enjoyable part about working for levis is of course the customer being able to have a customer leave feeling fully confident about his/her purchase."
good,"L'environnement de travail est très agréable. Les employés sont tous chaleureux et bon vivants."
good,I have 10+ years in customer service . I have had opportunities to work for three of the largest retailers here in America. I have experience in the retail world as far as building customer relationships and understanding there needs and concerns. I have been trained to understand and help solve any customer related issues by working side by side with my management teams to gain there experience of customer service requirements . I have my challenges over the years but by basic communication and listening skills I am able to preform that on a daily basis I enjoy assisting customer in helping them with there needs .
good,"no team work."
good,"ive learn a lot about managing employees, being an example. work hard, help to improve the store development and kpi's."
good,"Management is all over the place, coworkers were great and very supportive. No place for advancement here."
good,"I thought I loved this job when I first began working there.  I was coming out of a tough patch in life and felt relieved to have a job again.  All was well and I was sailing along fine-until the economy started falling.  I was given the choice of either moving to another shift and work a five day week or taking a lay-off.  I chose the alternate shift. Suddenly, my productivity started to fall off.  I made every effort to improve, but I could not.  I believe the supervisor on that shift used a different equation to come up with our rates.  When I returned to my normal shift, my rates improved, but I was written up while on the other shift and since I had two priors for attendance, I was let go.  One of the write ups was due to fall off within a week, but it was too late.  I feel betrayed because I continued working, I did not take the lay-off.  If I had, I would still have a job because I would not have received the write up for productivity.  It is sad that people are just a number and a rate at big companies.  They don't seem to want to consider the human aspect of anything.  I thought I was a good worker, but management made me feel like a free loading oaf when it was all over.  I was very depressed.  I made many friends and enjoyed that job and working for that company while it lasted. There were quotas to meet, but I enjoyed the steady pace.  It was also a 4 day work week which was great."
good,"Levi's is a great place to work as a summer job or something extra. I enjoy working with the public and my co-workers, however, this is not the ideal job to fulfill all of your financial needs. The hours you are scheduled depends on how well the store's sales are doing. This causes scheduling to be rather unpredictable. The best part of this job is the social, fast paced environment. I enjoy helping customers find a great outfit or gift for someone else. "
good,You never know if your going to have your job the next day no matter how hard you work
good,"Sales Analysis,stock analysis,competition analysis."
good,The company has a great retirement program. Management has changed 4 times since 2.5 years I started. You learn a little of it every task for the store as a stylist.
good,I worked by butt off and I hadnt stopped all day. The new people that just stood around. I did my best but in the longrun I would have never been able to physically work there anyway. I enjoyed it because it was the 3 days a week.
good,"The only thing good about this job was the pay. The days were long and the breaks were too far apart, there were times when they had us working for 7 hours without breaks because everyone went on break at the same time."
good,"Mh time at Levis was mixed, the structure of the job was good however management was horrible.  A formal payroll clerk 5 years previous was all of sudden running the financial unit.  Management would sell out their employees in a second (sending jobs to india) if it means they can save a buck.  High turnover rate as many knew that their job was expendable."
good,Honestly I only worked there for maybe a month. I had to leave because my father had a stroke and I called to tell them I couldn’t come in for my shift and they fired me the next day so I wasn’t going back....
good,They need new management . There is employees that been working here for years and they never promote . Professionalism not so good .  Favoritism plays a big role at this work place . Store manager does not even know what goes half the time in the store
good,"When you have better customer service and determination you will make more sales. This does not go to the commission because there is no commission which is negative. This gove you no incentive to sell. However, it does look good for the managers of which get bonuses. So you if you want to work so that the managers get your bonus this is the job for you."
good,Overall company was nice to be with. The way your shift goes is based on which manager is working. Working at levis was... work. At times I was worried to work because people steal from the company often.
good,"Typical day at work was mixed in regard to business. During holidays, store was always busy and in need of support personnel."
good,My managers would have me running around and sometimes it was too hectic to keep up with the multiple things i was asked to do all at once. its overwhelming sometimes.
good,Levis was a decent place to work at with all the people who were employed there. Made a lot of new friends who I still talk to but I was not given enough hours so I quit
good,I did not get enough feedback from my supervisor and definitely felt like he could care less about his temporary workers once he got them to finish the job.
good,"I am a big fan of the Levi's brand and was excited to work at a retail store with a familiar product. The introduction to everything made the job appear as promising, but it gradually became worse as a work environment and the management only decreased in productivity. It became really bad when i became Cash Wrap Lead. The promotion excited me but when they finally had someone who could now do returns and exchanges other than themselves and the one other cash wrap lead, they dumped every task onto me and it was overwhelming. They were always in the back of the store, sitting at the computer and pretending to be working."
good,"The energy of the employees was good, but management had no leadership skills. Training is a whole joke, so you have to make sure you ask someone reliable and honest if you have any questions regarding the job. Management answers questions in a very vague manner or in a very judgemental way so you don't really feel comfortable asking."
good,Open to contribute my ability to streamline IT processes. I would love to bring not only this method but my general organizational skills to this job at your company.
good,"Worked there for 4 years during the Economic Downturn. Pay was lousy but felt lucky to have a job. Worked three 12 hour days over the weekend. We never knew from week to week whether we were gonna work the entire weekend. Sometimes we only worked one day. If you have a poor manager, you end up doing your work and everyone else's work too."
good,The hardest part of the job would be suggestive selling a we all know everyone is different and unique in there own way . Having to have a short conversation with someone to figure out they style can be very exciting and interesting at the same time.
good,"Levis is a great company, but they had some issues with our stores management. There was a lawsuit over break times, and manipulation of the time clock. The sales floor team was great though. Can get boring during week days, and overly busy during holidays (expected). Good discounts on Jeans, but still not good enough based on the salary."
good,Don't wish to review this and it is ridiculous that you are asking me to do a review just to try and apply for another position somewhere else that may be of better benefit to me.
good,"if your a college kid home for the summer this is perfect for you. Its a cool laid back job, the pay isn't great and should be used as a second job for an adult with bills"
good,"Agradável, liberdade bom movimento ."
good,"The managers had there faves and they would work their best sales associates to a breaking point and not promote them. They promoted people that barely worked there and were very confused on what their title was. If they did not feel like doing something, they would tell you to do it. They would act as a parent and make disrespectful comments; very short breaks, and cut hours from your check. Sometimes only put you on the schedule for one day even when you have a family to feed."
good,Working at levis has its days. Like every retail job you have to deal with rude costumers. Unfortunately the management team aren't the most professional.
good,"Poor communication between management, and leaders. Outdated technology and equipment is the cause of inefficiency and down time. Warehouse conditions are dirty and unsafe"
good,"Company is okay.  "
good,"No comments, Honestly is a good job, but the way of the job is classified don't help you to make enough money, for be a worldwide company. Everyone are classified as carton handle even the equipment operators. As a carton handle don't make more than  $10 p/h and the equipment operators make  $0.50 additional meanwhile in another companies the forklift operators make more than  $12 p/h. Plus the on site Union don't even help you out. I can say more but..."
good,"very productive and goal set job, inspiring and organized,fair and very friendly staff.management is great and very reliable."
good,Mostly a fast past environment which I enjoy to keep me busy. The hardest part was when black Friday came with all the sales many people came to shop.
good,"This was my first job so I reallly didn't have any complaints about its. The work enviroment was chilled, The co-workers were and managers were nice. The hardest part about the job at first was converting the differnt types of pants size to our metric system but after awhile it came easy to me now I know it like that. The most enjoyable part was joking with the customers and helping pick out their pants size."
good,"A typical day at work when its busy , theres a lot of interacting, making sales, and working with everyone else to make sure the store is stocked up.e"
good,Purtroppo è stata un'esperienza da cui ho tratto diffcilmente aspetti positvi. Nontanto legati all'azienda ma allo staf di lavoro con cui si sono create diverse complicazioni vista la responsabilità di alcune figure che veniva completamente dimenticata in situazioni di fondamentale importanza.
good,A typical day at Levis was giving great customer service to any customer who came into the store. We would also make sure keep the store in great shape.
good,"working environment is not what I thought it would be,for this size company.There isn't anything else that I care to discuss about this company.It is employment that I accept until I can find something better and less stressful."
good,"ho imparato ad aver un rapporto di corteia e gentilezza con i clienti , che portava ad un profitto sulle vendite"
good,"Working the night shift was challenging as a single father of one.  I became weary from missing my daughter's school activities, not to mention having no family time in the evenings."
good,"Levi's was a start off job just to get some experience. The job was pretty laid back sometimes which was cool. With this job though there wasn't really any benefits, so thats why ended up leaving"
good,Very fast past moving a lot going on very quick and lots of customers come through with a lot of question that need to be answer a lot of foreign people asking for translation in sizes from america from other countries
good,A typical day at levis is very energetic full of tourists. Great customer service atmosphere I learned a lot about the retail clothes business. My coworkers were fun energetic people like myself. Hardest part of the job was closing recovering the store very time consuming but always got the job done.I loved the customer interaction and my coworkers made it fun to come to work
good,"a typical day at work goes pretty well, usually do the same routine. Co-workers help the day go by well, especially when customers are being difficult at times."
good,Bonne expérience en management
good,Customers speaks Spanish mainly; It’s a lot of replenishing and recovery; Closing shifts CAN/HAVE end at 4am in the morning; The pay is not great but discount might make up for it.
good,The job is a good retail job depending on what position you are. The culture is nice because Levi's is a classic brand and sticks to its mission statement.
good,Being a maintenance Technician for Levi’s has its goods and it’s bad but the bad is really bad the first thing on the cons list is all the supervisor care more about kissing the benhind of the maintenance manager more than they care about the well being of their own guys (that goes for all shifts) secondly you will work 6-7 days every week 8-12 hour shifts depending on the day and your shift. Also the equipment and tooling there is as old as 20 years old so nothing ever works and everything is always broken. The good part of this job is definitely the pay there is potential of maintenance techs to make anywhere from 50k-100k in a year for the simple nature of the work it compensates very well but at the expense of your life. Also one of the bigger problems which I’m not sure there is a fix for is the union they are owned and controlled by the company none of their negotiations are for the benefit of employees and they go to the table with no leverage. Also the fact that the maintenance department shares the same union and contract with box packers who make $9 an hour is absurd I thoroughly enjoyed the job and most of my coworkers but management and the union really killed the will to want to show up and give 100% everyday
good,"Levis is a great company to work for. That being said, the managers can make a huge difference to that. With a manager that has almost no empathy towards other staff members, finding that desired work/life balance is nearly impossible."
good,Employees worked wells as a team. Mangers did not communicate with employees very well. They would discuss your issues amongst themselves and not with you. Managers showed much favoritism ad did not honor many of Levi's policies. Would not recommend job if your looking for more than $100 a week.
good,"Working at levis is not the most difficult job to have, most of the staff will be relatively young, many in the high school to college range. Workers tend to be a bit immature, and management is very lax."
good,"Working at Levi's has been fun and challenging. The culture provided me enough opportunity to experiment, learn and progress. The strong corporate values had been the prime reason for joining the organisation and also working for over 15 years."
good,i only worked 1-2 days a week which is a lot less than i would need. some days are fast paced and some days  are relaxed and slow. the people working there are very nice.
good,Levi is a good company to work for if you are a college student with no hopes of moving up in the company. They do not take suggestions for improvement lightly.
good,"Not a very good work condition. Managers are not very nice, they cut hours while they keep hiring new people. Sometimes they do not know what to do and you have to teach them step by step."
good,Would be a great place to work if HR was more efficient and decisive. Unfortunately it's the blind leading the blind. Not vision or knowledge to move forward.
good,"Prepare for long nights because management only schedules 2-3 people to close, even on busy nights. Especially in summer, have fun staying til 1:30 am"
good,"The company is great, history is interesting and something you can stand behind, the product is outstanding.  BUT, there is a feeling of running in place and getting nowhere that happens when working in the retail stores. The expectations to execute flawlessly are constantly preached yet the retail teams are given little hours to achieve flawless results. Most associates are paid minimum wage which allows for little job advancement to those looking to get their foot in and stay around with this great brand. Even with stellar performance, there is little hope for climbing up the wage ladder from sales associate (stylist). The upper field leadership does not want to listen to what obstacles the stores are facing and stores frequently hear the push to ""just make it happen"" or ""figure it out"" when most of the stores out there are just trying to give outstanding customer service and do as much as they can between helping customers."
good,"Una empresa muy rígida y antigua, conceptos de MKT viejos. No todos los locales de la OLS funcionan con las mismas promociones y condiciones. Había veces que venían cliente preguntando para comprar con promociones de tal banco y nos informaban que mejor preferían acercarse, ya que en otro local podría aprovechar el beneficio de sus tarjetas. Lo que esta como sucursal nos traía varios problemas, y consecuencias en el ambiente laboral, gracias a los medidores irreales con los que cuenta la empresa para evaluarnos como vendedores. Una especie de cuenta cabezas que no toma dimension si es una familia la que entra o sale. Nos exigían una cierta cantidad de tickets por conversión. No importaba si era una familia de 7 que compraba una sola cosa. Y así misma a esta contaba a la salida y a la entrada, que seria un total de 14 personas, cosa que era imposible sacar tantos tickets en la situación en la que se encuentra nuestro país."
good,Great Brand with fun perks outside of compensation/benefits. Tough retail business makes job harder. Job culture is also very competitive and has a lot of room for improvement.
good,"Typical day for work was coming in and cleaning the whole store before the store was opened."
good,"It's a really fun, low stress place to work with flexible hours and a strong social aspect. They'll work around your other jobs and/or classes so you still have time for all your responsibilities. It's not difficult work and if you like people and being social, that's exactly the kind of thing that gets praise. It's great for seasonal or part time, but unfortunately there are only five in-store positions including management so if you're looking for a job with lots of advancement opportunity this isn't really the best place. Overall though, it's a great place to find a first job or to work seasonally or while you're in college. I wouldn't necessarily recommend if you're out to find a long term career. It's exactly what you think it'll be."
good,"A Short term Stint for me doing Sales for Levi's."
good,"While you're allowed (read: semi-required) to wear Levi's to work everyday, the company culture is pretty typically corporate. Lots of politc-ing required to make yourself noticed/heard/appreciated. "
good,"I was working at Levis for almost 4 to 5 days a week on top of school, extra curricular, and sports activities. Picked up and gained knowledge of how to handle clothes/ jeans, with appropriate folding techniques. Very proficient on floor, to interacting with costumers in order to help find sizes, and restock the shelves. Price tagged and arranged jeans in stock room when needed. Was able to keep line of costumers down through a fast pace with working on the register, and handling money. Over all made new friends, gained valuable knowledge, and enjoyed working at Levis for almost a year. Still very familiar with jean sizes and styles to help costumers in future."
good,"Co workers were positive, outgoing and very driven. most enjoyable part of my job was helping others. Management was good."
good,"nice place to work with long hours with no social life throughout week, nice place to work for bachelors but certainly not for a family men/women"
good,"Un día típico de trabajo se presentaba con mucho flujo de clientes lo que llevaba a reforzar aún más la atención a los mismos que previamente había adquirido con mi experiencia laboral para de esa manera llevar a cabo mi objetivo como vendedor, superando ampliamente la espectativa de ventas mensuales de la empresa, al mismo tiempo aprendí mucho del control y manejo de caja y del resto de los empleados ya que la intención de la empresa siempre fue la proponerme cargos mas altos. Con respecto a la dirección/gerencia de la misma el trato siempre fue formal y con mis colegas dentro del local comercial excelente. El trabajo para el que fui contratado no me presento dificultades y lo que mas me gustó de dicho puesto fue la posibilidad de interiorizarme y aprender mas acerca de todos los objetivos y tareas que me propuse."
good,Was a relaxed place to work at but it was all about the customers. If it wasnt about a customer managers didnt bother to care or listen
good,All that was done here was packing huge orders of Levi clothing items to send out to different retail stores. you worked at your own station and never really had the chance to talk with other employees. And the management staff was semi friendly and were not very quick to help you when you needed it cause there were not enough shift leaders compared to how many employees worked there. this was only a seasonal job as well and not a very great place to work honestly.
good,"A typical day at work would be pretty busy. We are a high-volume store with a daily traffic of about 7-10 thousand people.Working together definitely gets the job done. My position at Levis is a Cashier Lead. Being that I am the only Lead, My duties are those of an entry level manager.Once each employee comes in, I brief them on our day so far, I answer phones, schedule possible employees for interviews, set up daily paperwork so the day can go as smooth a possible. I am responsible for outgoing shipment. Also making sure all open/closing cash wrap rituals are completed on a daily basis. I am responsible for cash counting at the end of each day."
good,"working with a foreigners you start to pick up bits of the different languages and culture, management is fun and playful but can be a bit to childish at times. a lot of fun company community serves per month."
good,"Learned how to talk to customers and how to sell clothing from a specific brand, Learned to stay on task and stay professional. The best part of the day was seeing who you got to work with and what manager was going to be their so you would know if today is going to have challenging times. The more challenging the best."
good,"Starts off with management telling you what needs to be done, doesn't take into consideration of the employees life outside of work even for a part time job. Learned how to speak easier with different groups of people and ethnicities. Co-workers all worked together for the common goal of selling whatever we can to whoever we can as fast as we can and effectively. Constantly moving and talking."
good,sales associates were great but one of the managers had a screw loose. Unprofessional and irresponsible management is what drove me away from levis. But the sales associates were good. the schedule was not really all that flexible.
good,"The day would begin with opening paper work. I used excel sheets from the previous day and entered the statistics in the excel workbook. A new excel sheet would be created for the new business day containing details of sales goals, key points of interest and the daily focus of the business. Afterwards I would input appropriate payroll hours into Kronos for the associates who worked the previous day while fixing any timestamp errors."
good,"Work/Life balance is probably the only good thing I can rate the highest in this organization. Rest any parameters wouldn't rate the company high on employee friendly atmosphere."
good,"I and my fellow co-workers were forced to forced to push clothing sales and ""help"" customers to a fault by management. Every customer must be greeted and offered help, asked what they're looking for the second in the door. If they say they're fine we still had to ask more questions before we left them alone for like 2 minutes before we had to go back and ask again and recommend they buy some other article of clothing. I have read reviews stating how uncomfortable the customers felt and annoying the employees are. Speaking of management, the place is like a high school drama show. It may be entertaining for a while but the constant gossip and talking behind each others back got really tiresome."
good,"high goals, difficult to achieve."
good,"The Levi's culture was prevalent since day one of working there. Having such a huge employee number, it felt hard to move up quickly. While employed at Levi's, I learned the value of human interaction and how to talk to just about anyone. "
good,Une équipe de travail solide saine et soudée constitue selon moi la base de toute journée réussie. Le fait de pouvoir travailler dans de bonnes conditions est essentiel.
good,"Directly responsible for the hiring, performance development, and product knowledge training in the store. Ensuring staff is creating a presence and overall positive shopping experience in the store."
good,"Typically great learning experience. Gained skills in collaborating with many different types of co-workers at all levels.  However, there is little chance for upward mobility within the company in the visual field."
good,"A usual day of work consists of clocking in and right after begin moving and unloading packages and organizing them.  I improved my team-work skills with this job because everything flows smoother when people help each other.  I learned about Levis and their commitments and goals and pursuit to give the best hospitality possible.  The management was okay, hours were always given and/or cut.  Schedules got changed every other week and it's a hard job to get a raise/promoted.  Co-workers were all around age 20.  Young group of friendly co-workers that make work more enjoyable.  Hardest part of work is during holidays where retail stores get invaded with customers with high demands, makes the pace that much faster and the environment is stressful from all the heat.  Most enjoyable part of the job is when we do what we planned to do, without encountering any problems from other the other shifts."
good,i get along very well with my co-workers
good,"The team that was in-charge of the project i designed was unsure of what they wanted ultimately. "
good,Levi’s was a great job until the amazing store manager left in my time there. Other then them not pushing me up to management when the store manager wanted me to be so bad. Corporate did not hire internally for management. The closest I got to management was a sales lead. The new store manager new hardly anything and it was just my time to go.
good,"I was in a different area of sales associate, my managers wanted me in a lead position at the age of 16 since i was climbing the ladder very quickly. so when i turned 17 and was at the top sales associate wise they would not give me the promotion because i was a minor. but they still expected me to do lead position things. i was basically doing a a position i wasn’t paid for. so it grew tired and working was just not as fun when your not getting paid for the amount of work you actually do."
good,ok place to work if you are a student or looking for part time. management  always has tasks to be done through shifts. nice environment to work in. relaxing job overall.
good,aucun avis envers ce travail specific. cetait une ambiance assez stressante
good,"Love levis.. very good brand.. nd love to work there as a salesman,learnt a lote of thing nd enjoyed all training sasations . Gain more experience about brand nd customer s.. overall nice experience"
good,"This rating is based on the distribution center which is a union environment and is production based. There are 3 shifts to work. For the most part the inside is clean and presentable, clean restrooms, large cafeteria with windows to eat your lunch or purchase goods from vending or refrigerators. Employees are trained to work in their area and there are a small amount of employees who are crossed trained to other areas. It is not a positive, lively atmosphere with small perks of give-a-ways, ice cream socials, pop corn, pizza days etc. but the company does pay for 2 catered meals a year."
good,"Decent place to be. You do the same thing everyday. It’s good money when there’s overtime. It’s a typical warehouse job, didn’t see any really growth to go up the ladder when I was there"
good,The most enjoyable part I can take away from this job was the relationships you made with fellow co-workers and consumers. Work/Life balance was not the greatest.
good,"Levis was a really great place to work at about a year ago. Lately there has been a lot of changes in management that has made it really difficult to be there. The coworkers are great and we have lots of fun when aloud too. They work well for the most part with you schedule, they are very flexible."
good,A company with a rich history that provided great merchandise for the everyday average person. If you enjoy working with denim and learning about where the gene culture comes from then this company is for you.
good,"Slow paced work environment. Compensation was also very low, yet performance expectations were set very high. The culture shifted several times because of changes in management. This caused disconnected communication between management and staff, which eventually resulted in increasing rates of turnover."
good,The company revolves around a fast pace working environment centered on team work and work ethic. It has many opportunities for growth and it has job benefits
good,"Buen ambiente laboral, horario flexible, jefes muy considerados al momento de justificar una falta, etc, trabajo relajado y muy buen salario para en tiempo de horario flexible de 4/horas de jornadas laborales diarias"
good,"Typical day required opening and closing the store, making sure that all the paperwork was up to date, weekly schedules and store quotas were met, and merchandise was received and brought to the sales floor. "
good,"Working for Levis helped me learn a lot about the retail industry. I love the company itself, but I did not like the way my specific location was run. They didn't seem to pick the right type of people for their job title, which made it difficult to better myself as an employee."
good,Learned a lot about the way levis makes jeans and how to take care of them.fun place to work at. great coworkers and fun environment.
good,"A typical day at Levi's would be me greeting customers, proving customer service, and servicing the fitting rooms."
good,"ma pire expérience."
good,"The job itself isn't the issue, its the pay and how corrupted management is. Everyone is friends with everyone, meaning they choose when they want to press rule issues or anything, They aren't fair."
good,Currently under major changes. Leadership team does not seem fully tied and committed to company values and mission. Different levels of management lack consistency in views.
good,"There were things that I noticed the higher ups would do that I didn't approve of but didn't say anything about because I didn't feel like it. The managers could improve on their management skills greatly. Instead of looking to be a boss, they could be a leader. The supervisors did a great job at management."
good,The company continues to provide lateral move opportunities for both personal and professional development of its employees.  This includes moving around outside of one's primary skill position.
good,"Levi's was a rapid paced job where we received people from all over the world, because Levi's brand is known world wide selling jeans wasn't the difficult part. I learned to be patient with people, because everyone came in all shapes and sizes. Helping people is rewarding, and loved to see people leave with a smile on there face. The hardest part was seeing people leave our store empty handed and couldn't find anything they liked. The best part about my job was my co-workers we were a family, I spent most of my days at work, my co-workers kept me going when days were long and slow."
good,"Recently laid off 800 managers world wide - expecting more lay offs next year."
good,本日所在的店鋪是一間外判的LEVIS店鋪 可能由於是外判的關係 感覺上店鋪管理人在人事方面特別是編排更表的事情上面特別不上心通常都是臨放假的前1天才知道自己放假 根本不能夠合理的安排假期，另外男性員工的工作量比女性員工打出很多 LEVIS主打牛仔褲 但是牛仔褲的重量1袋可能有十幾KG 不時的要將新到的貨物搬上3樓另到平日的工作壓力大大增加
good,"We were quickly instructed on what to focus on before each shift and after new management, we were always updated on how the store was doing and what our goals were. I learned the history of levi's, better ways to approach even the shyest of customers and curve ID system along with all the different fits of jean. I got along with pretty much everyone there no problem, almost the entire staff was very friendly and helpful. Hardest part of my job was doing the curve ID fitting at first. I enjoyed working with people and becoming more comfortable around strangers."
good,A place that used to be great to work. Management is constantly changing direction which affects employees and makes the work environment heavily unstable. Coworkers are great but a large emphasis on knowing more if you've been in the company longer. Very hard to enact change. Good values and work-life balance. Very little opportunity to advance.
good,"Abertura da loja , atendimento de fornecedores , cobrança no  caixa ,organização da loja , fechamento de caixas ."
good,"Initiative, come on time, hard working, polite friendly with my co worker,"
good,"Staff rotas and management, cash management, banking, customer liason, window displays, open and closing of the store."
good,As a senior sales associate I understand the importance of KPI's and how they integrate into the success of my business. I have a strong UPT and ADS week in and week out and continue to lead the way in sales.I work with other sales associates and teach them about fits and how to identify a customer's needs.
good,"Tacky two faced management across the country. (middle management that is) people promoted to these positions who have never had one day of management training and don't have people skills. Duplicitous personalities that will cut you quick once you make your first mistake and are then out to get you. No second chances here regardless of your track record. Management is so scared to lose their jobs that they are very threatened by anyone below them who challenges the norm. Seriously, do not work here unless you have very thick skin."
good,A typical day at work was to make fit goals and sales goals. I learned how to polish up on how I approach my customers also some the terms used in retail. Management seem really cool at first but they do not treat you very well. The hardest part of the job was working with management. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with customers and assisting their needs.
good,Promoted too often from outside the company. Overall message very inconsistent.
good,"Levi's (HQ) was great from a work life balance perspective, but terrible in regards to career planning and advancement. There was absolutely no focus on advancement planning or development. It was ok for a short period, but overall I left because of poor management and the lack of mobility."
good,"You greet people, help them find what they are looking for, try and complete their outfits, fold a lot of jeans and make sure the store looks great. It is a really fun group of workers.The worst is closing beacuse you have to make sure everything is perfect and thats when you fold the most; but its really not that bad."
good,I feel like i spent the majority of my time cleaning up after the entire staff. Every time we had a store meeting we would talk about certain things.... None of which ever got done.
good,"It’s a great company to work for over all, I’ve worked in 2 separate locations in 2 different states and the management and staffing morality and overall work ethic differ drastically. So my overall rating was more so weighted on the location I am currently employed."
good,"When I first got there, the management was great. But then, when they all got switched to a different department, the atmosphere was very different and made a lot of people uncomfortable. If you weren’t Spanish, they pretty much treated you different. Some of the team captains were great all around but others weren’t."
good,Warehouse work is very demanding. Being on the move for most of the shift can definitely teach you how to prioritize and manage time better. I was thankful for the opportunity.
good,"If you apply here, you need to have communication and organizational skills  they hire seasonal it’s a great time to start always keep in mind when you work in retail you are required to work some if not most weekends"
good,"Working as a contractor at Levi Strauss for a short term assignment was great. The people were friendly and easy to work with. The culture seemed fine but as a contractor, that's hard to rate because you're not able to participate in the company meetings or events."
good,I learned a lot while I could. I learned that the customer can ways change his or her mind and it was a good experience to see how a few people can work in a team.
good,"I love Levis, I have been a Levis  customer for years so working for them was quite exciting. Working in a very international city I personally enjoyed meeting people form all over the world and it was so much fun to suggest and received feedback from people from all over the world ."
good,"Dissorginized, childish and unmotivated employees. When the cats away additude. There was little work ethics and it appeared to hire clicks of friends mainly. I was 20 plus years older and seemed to be the informer of work time versus gossip time."
good,"estresante, conflictos con e larea de ventas por  oc vencidas, conflictos el el área de surtido por no tener a tiempo los embarques"
good,Dynamique courtois polis et surtout ponctuel assidue dans toutes mes demarches
good,"-you have too teach your part-time because they might be 18 "
good,"Falta de comprensión "
good,It was a good part time job i guess. it was during the holidays so it was pretty busy. We stayed really late almost everytime i closed because it took so long to fold and put back all the jeans the customers left behind.
good,"don’t apply there. The company doesn’t seem to care about sales associates and managers because they hire store managers who don’t know how to do their job and intimidate other coworkers and treat them horribly. They are unfair to minorities, however, they pretend to be so open and loving to all people."
good,Typical day was clocking in and being told was the goal was for the day and then being assigned for a section to be in. Management was in the ages between mind 20's to early 30's when I was there in 2016. I have to say the favoritism and seniority was real! I was a minor at the time and I would only get one break per shift and it was only 10 minutes! Nobody is allowed off on thanksgiving and black Friday.
good,"Just a different work enviormnet, it was cool. Nothing to hard, just fix  jeans, help people pick out jeans, as well as, fitting jeans on people. Great job when you are exploring your style"
good,"More training ...on management and improvement human facility...better working environment cafeteria and not vending machine food better coffee breah only "
good,"Great place to work. I enjoyed working with my team, and I had a awesome store manger. You have to wear the jeans, but you get free clothes if you make bonus each month."
good,Overall it was a great first job. Taught me a lot of skills. Made friends through the job. Wish they did more recognition for hard work and dedication.
good,"All staff were always negative on the job , complaining about not wanting to be there. All managers had no potential nor did they look forward to greeting customers."
good,"The company of Levi's itself was amazing to work for. The culture and benefits of the job are a given."
good,Most of the employees were dedicated workers who had worked for the company for many years.  It was often fun.  Coworkers became almost like family. That was until the company decided it was more profitable to move outside the United States and close its domestic manufacturing facilities.
good,"Trabajas bien, te pagan comisiones por lo que vendes, pero no te contrata directamente la empresa"
good,"The company was Victorian in origin, having formed its own in-house enterprise computing business sector to feed input to initiate flow of goods, track flow of goods, and show sales by product by month.  It was a behemoth when I got there, and so old there were no longer viable instructions for use."
good,Très longue avec de courtes pauses très problématique pour être à 100%
good,"The best thing is if u meet your monthly goal, get a free item of $100.00 or less. The worst is you don't get a good set of hours as a stylist so one week you can work 20 hours and another week you work 10 hours."
good,"It was good while it lasted.They give back to the community and compensate their employees well. The sample sale was good, prices were reasonable. If you are looking for a better work life balance, this is not the company to work for."
good,"a place where people would come and do the job they were told to do, not that good of pay considering they would offer more but still a nice place to work"
good,stagnant career that are not take you anywhere. system are not upgraded and its working likes in the 80's century. Overall its a fun environment and keep you away from stress.
good,"Although it may have changed by now, they had developers working in a small room called the pit, and it pretty much was.  8 devs working in a small room.  Probably better places to work if you have the opportunity."
good,"lindo ambiente laboral , buena conexion con los clientes"
good,"I worked while I was in high school. It was a perfect fit for a high school student at the time. Management may be a little funky. I was top sales and received less hours than most of the people I worked with. This may have been due to the female manager at the time, yes, it's that ridiculous."
good,I learned a lot working for Levi.  The staff and the management team were all very supportive.  Advancement was always welcomed within the company as well.
good,"As a salesman, you must know the product, and the methods of selling it in order to be successful. The main goal is to provide a great shopping experience for the customers."
good,"trabajo serio y responsable, buena organización, compañeras encantadoras"
good,"Buena experiencia laboral, donde pude aplicar mis gustos por las ventas"
good,"I worked there as a seasonal Stock Associate two times. It's a very fast paced job, you need to know what to get and where to get the desired items needed for the front. On slow days you can kinda sit and chat for a minute or two before doing a task. It's honestly just a beginning job for young people. Mainly management tends to be older."
good,fun place to work if you are a high school drop out not a career choice. Every moment at this place was filled with danger or either being hit on by old men or midgets that smelled like cheese
good,"Empleados amables, responsabilidad buena "
good,"It was a great company to work for just not somewhere I could see myself being for very long, the hours are fickle and the communication wasn't as great as it could have been. The management was amazing and what the company stands for has turned me into a life long supporter of Levi's. However if you're looking for an entry level job to try and make some sort of a living this isn't for you; it's great for extra spending money."
good,Fast paced and really competitive. Benefits did include beer on Fridays and discounts on clothes. A nice place to work for local company in San Francisco.
good,Great environment to work. The customers were great. You learn a lot of facts about Levi's history. They were very flexible with school schedules. Great company to be a part of.
good,Working in a retail job allows someone new to the working world an opportunity to discover their likes and dislikes.  It provides direction for the next career move.
good,This location was an outlet store.  I feel that the district managers put way to much stress on the store managers. This caused the stress to be passed along to all of the part time employees.  The company has a great history and excellent products.  I just felt like it wasn't run properly.
good,Constant steady hours for B shift worked extremely hard for weeks straight with very few days off.  Coordinators took favoritism over employees. Not a lot of opportunities.
good,Fast pace environment and lots of things to do. Especially during holidays and Summer. This kept me super busy and always working which is nice during long hour days.
good,"Set up product displays on nesting tables, gondolas, T-Stands and four way units.Communicate and partner effectively and interact well with the other teams."
good,"Representative sales in retail sector, throughout career acquires solid understanding of customer"
good,"Good employee culture, but low pay compared to competitors. No commission on sales, and a computer-organized scheduling system which did not work as well as a person would."
good,"Changes in management caused tension. Besides management, it was fun to work there with the friends you make there. It seemed like a temporary job until you found something better"
good,"Working for Levi's mainly consist of four hour shifts three days a week, unless it's peak season. You learn about standards look, and customer wise. Management often puts tasks meant for them, onto their sales associates, and don't bother to give you the recognition for it. As for the rest of the staff, they're friendly and for the most part share the same frustrations. The job is not very difficult in any aspect, and the most enjoyable part of my job is the other sales associates I work with."
good,The owner really cares for his employees here he goes out of his way to help each one and meet there needs the shop runs alilttle slow at times but overall it was a god job
good,"Levi Strauss & Co. in Cabazon, CA was a great place to work at with a great staff. The management team needs some work in providing information to their seasonal employees."
good,Working here was a very fun environment. Free pair of jeans every month if you hit your sales. We would also have a few levi's parties here and there. Its also a good place to enhance your customer service skills as you will be on the floor making sales most of the time.
good,"Seasonal, not great work environment. But still, steady work while it lasted. Unloaded trucks and stocked the stock room.  Poor management."
good,While they were in this country they were a good company to work for. Their health insurance was top notch. the ira's were very good. the salary was very good if you could make production.
good,This was my first job. They forced the concept in your brain to cater to every single thing the customer wanted. This annoyed me until I got other jobs and realized that this phenomenon happens everywhere. This has really great co workers and great values. And it was pretty cool working at the first ever jean company.
good,deal with a lot of customers. have nice store and great promotions. happy environment  and great associates to work with. New store thats why everything is nice and clean.
good,"This was a great place to work if you are looking to make it a temporary thing. However, I would not recommend for long term."
good,unfortunately I'm not able to give a proper review as it would affect my severance package. I signed an agreement an therefore I'm unable to give an honest opinion about working there. I will say that my immediate manager was far beyond the best person I've ever had the privilege of working for/with
good,"This was my first job and it was during the holiday season. Despite having to work during Black Friday and the Christmas season, I really enjoyed this job. My managers and supervisors were amazing and relaxed. The store was run great and even though I was there for a limited time, I enjoyed it, thoroughly. I would recommend apply here. The only clothing requirement was wearing a pair of Levis jeans, but their jeans are so comfortable that you really don't mind."
good,Awesome company to be part of. There was always something new and exciting that you would share with your team. Great opportunities to be developed as an employee to reach the next step in your career.
good,Working at the Flagship location is extensive and provides a lot of opportunity to partner with different teams at the corporate office on a regular basis.
good,Got to learn about one of the best companies.  Pro about the companies was the dicount they offered and cons were the hours. sometimes the sales goals was little hard to get.
good,"Could get hectic. Met a lot of interesting people. But overall they work you out for such little pay. Could be there all night to early morning refolding jeans."
good,"The people were really nice,the managers were always in the back talking never helping in the front. The customers were great and the store was always clean"
good,"Rozpakowywanie dostawy,porządkowanie sklepu dbanie o czystość i porządek w salonie,wysyłanie raportów."
good,"There wasn't much traffic on the weekends and even less on weekdays. It was a fairly friendly environment though. Most of the managers were really affective at their jobs, and I got along with my co-workers. The only downside to it would be the busy work that was given to us just because."
good,Worked here while in high school great discounts and opportunity to start off in sales. Holiday hours like any place in retail is hectic.
good,opened the store had successful first year. had a tough time with turn over rates due to people performance. training and development was very good.
good,"Fue corto el período de tiempo que estuve trabajando en esta empresa, sin embargo, tenía algunas compañeras, la gran mayoría, que me trataron de forma espectacular desde el primer momento."
good,"I loved to work as a sales executive/ associate and being store keeper in my desired location at Dubai Mall, but i felt so sad because the company has going to give up the brand without any information to all employee. The company was so good, my co-workers participated their daily responsibility and we have a good team players/members at all time."
good,I joined the company for the schedule and stayed for that reason.  As I moved up and as the years went on things got worse.  The pay is well below competitive and their staffing is really starting to reflect the discrepancy.  Turnover is astronomical with a dozen or more temps starting every week during busy seasons.
good,"in my 5 years of experience in IT field, i used to spend each day in giving a support in my end users. And i learned a lot of things dealing with their problems not only in my profession but also as a person."
good,i learned how to package boxes and take oredds form computers. the hardest part of this job is standing up for 12 hours doimg the samthing. Enjoyable part is that its not hard nor stressing......
good,"atender al cliente, checar mercancía, levantar pedidos, acomodo de tienda, organizar horarios de comida"
good,"While employed at Levi Strauss, I was able to meet a lot of different people.  The company is great for a younger individual, and would serve as a great entry level job."
good,"empresa com uma visão empreendedora,patroes excelentes,salario mais ou menos base de shopping.um lugar muito agradável de se  trabalhar .só sai de lá por causa do salario e o horário do domingo."
good,"unload inventory from trailers, enter inventory into computer system (red Prairie) count inventory to match the Load sheet then put away inventory in its staging Location."
good,"Levis was a very easy going, yet competitive job. I learned various fashion trends, and body shape assessment techniques. Management was very inexperienced and rather youthful, as were my very friendly workers. There were no difficult parts in my daily work, and I enjoyed relating to the many people I came in contact with."
good,"good company to work with. good culture to work in IT team"
good,"una marca muy atractiva para promocionar, se lleva acabo de acomodo de la mercancía, mercadear, trato directo con el cliente, bue ambiente de trabajo."
good,"a starter job"
good,"I am apart of the stock team at Levi's so a typical day working includes me replenishing the store making sure all sizes are out on the floor, running out the fitting room and more. The hardest part about working is maintaining the store as customers come and go. My co-workers are good and cool to work with. I've learned a lot about how the store is run and how it is supposed to be set up and all the specifics of the store. I've also learned about the clothing that is in the store,"
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is the diversification of customers that patronize the store. You will get to meet people from different walks of life.
good,"Aucune évolution possible."
good,A typical day was working closely with the store manager to ensure the store products were correctly place. Ensuring new hires were trained according to the companys' standards
good,"This job was technically me first job. It was a very flexible, great for students; can be very hectic around holidays, but overall a good work experience."
good,"the job here was fine. it was good however, very hard to work your way up to management. i know people who still work there and it was very difficult for them to move on up having worked there for several years. the discount was great but the time was not worth it."
good,"My typical day at work was to serve customers, tidy, replenish at the end of the day, clean, serve customers at the till, provide excellent customer service at all times. "
good,"Typical Day: Clock in, clean and slave over sales floor messes and crowds with limited tongues. Along with meeting new cultures, interacting with employees (whether you want to or not), getting a small gap of time to rest, and ultimately giving the best service you can and adapt to everything at hand."
good,Like so many other companies they move the work to another country.
good,"A typical day at the moment i joined.Every day i learn a new skill, all about store operation.Management always right at there point.The hardest part to assemble and making a coordination among the staff, and the enjoyable part is to sell a product to the Consumer."
good,Working a Levi's was a comfortable and fun place to work. I got to help people who were shopping and gain some retail experience.
good,"Good company to work,No.1 Brand "
good,"You have to talk a lot to the client , so i learn to be more social. You have to work hard to keep the clothes in order. The hardest part of the job will be in the rush hour when there is a lot of client to handle."
good,"Customers always come first and I was always great them with a friendly smile,along with a hello and ask how they are, ask if I can help them find something, tell them about sail items, and tell them my name if they need help.  We do a lot of shipment of knew product  which requires lifting heavy boxes and also censoring everything as well."
good,"Hours are very limited, on-call most of the time"
good,"not alot of hours, very popular company, paid every other week,"
good,le personnel était un peu difficile a travailler. La gérante était très stricte
good,"ambiente super agradável, equipe excelente porém não oferece oportunidade de crescimento aos funcionários."
good,"Difficult at the time as Levi's was closing plants across Canada and my role included running scenarios that impacted many individuals."
good,"I enjoyed this place also. It amazed me as we prepared the clothes, shoes, purses, and belts to be ship out top all those different companies."
good,livré a vous meme les patron vous font confiance en vous laissant parfois seul avec le magasin a géré mais il y a une chouette embranche de boulot
good,i worked for three monthes seasonal part time. the people didnt really like me. but the management was nice.
good,"The store I worked for is no longer in business, but it was a fun, entry-level job."
good,"O maior contra é por ser em shopping, torna o horário complicado. Porém, fui recompensado com uma gerência responsável e uma equipe prestativa."
good,"Reorganized the extensive collection of clothing so that both the design team and customers would find it more convenient to purchase/acquire the item of there desire."
good,I don't think there is anything I didn't like about the job itself. I enjoy working with clients and helping people get what they need.
good,Worked with the company for two years. Gained a lot of knowledge and skills.
good,"Bra arbetsplats, bra tider, ledning och helt okej arbetstider. Rabatt på kläder och en del visningar per år."
good,"They are strict with schedules, and will fire you if you can't show up to the days they want you to."
good,Retail & customer service.  Helped customers throughout their whole process of purchasing clothes.   Restocking.  Like working here just not receiving any hours.
good,great place to work.  loved the job and having the opportunity to work with so many different people.
good,"In levi's a typical day would be trying to meet the sales supervisor set for you to accomplish and making sure your section is always in an orderly fashion and neat. While working in Levi's i learned that having a job teaches you responsibility and gives you in idea on what the real world is like. My managers where all very friendly and outgoing, they will always make sure they have a connection with each and every employee. Co-workers were all friendly and east to get along with. The hardest part of my job working in levi's would have to be trying to talk to customers who did not know a lick of english and spoke a foreign language tha'ts not spanish. The best part of my job was always going to work because it was such a great enviorment you just loved everything about it "
good,Nice location and good benefits. Everyday was different so it didnt get boring. 
good,"Very organized workplace. Depending on the shift, I either received merchandise and stocked it or I was on the sales floor organizing and helping the floor associates with sizes/colors for customers. "
good,"Maintained daily inventory control of price tags, labels and boxes to ensure accurate production for shipping.Shipped and received clothing to/from global locations. Operated standup and sit down forklifts (low boy) on a daily basis.  Management was helpful when I had questions.  Coworkers worked as a team.  The hardest part of my job was the commute.  The most enjoyable was the freedom to work at my own pace."
good,"I enjoyed my short time at Levi's, despite the current employees never letting me forget the fact that I was nothing but a ""temp"". I wasn't sure what to expect, being my first retail experience, but it wasn't worse than I expected, that I can say. I learned to keep my head down, and speak when spoken to in appropriate instances, and how to move quickly in an insanely fast-paced environment, especially during the 48 hours we were open around Thanksgiving. The toughest thing for me was going to work under managers who never really seemed to care, and were more wrapped up in the daily happening of the store's cliques than their managerial duties. The thing I miss most about working at Levi's was the direct customer contact that is constantly available on the retail floor. I enjoy connecting with people and this was a great outlet for me in this manner."
good,This job is the very definition of multi-tasking and customer service. During the busy periods of the day I am always on my feet going from customer to customer--helping everyone. Which can also be the hardest part of the job because my goal is to make every customer happy.
good,"tiene un buen ambiente de trabajo,he aprendido a la jente,la verdad mi jefa es una muy buena jefa y mis companeras hay de todo, lo mas dificil es cuando me renuevan contrato ese es el motivo de kerer buscar otro trabajo creo y kiero crecer"
good,"A typical day involved go backs, fixing up clothes to make it look presentable and helping customers find their size in jeans (mainly). Most of my co-workers were awesome, not everyone was straight, white, and going to harvard in the fall--I am definitely not. Everyone was different and fun loving. I learned how to multitask and deal with customers. Working with others was great but folding jeans you just folded three minutes ago gets tedious-- but its worth it."
good,"I only worked in this location for a year before they closed. It was fun, minimal corporate involvement made it a relaxing environment."
good,Levi's Strauss & Co is an exceptional company with strong core values and philosphy. They offer great benefits and opportunities.
good,"Assumed responsibilities of storage of store manager upon her absence: opening and closing store, over seeing store operations, ensuring the execution of daily profit goals through hourly sales and effective communication."
good,"it was one of my first job as a sale associate, i gain experience and learned how to make sales..."
good,"Just like Adidas, Levi's was once filled with a friendly, fun staff. Work was very easy and I always handled the same tasks. I was there for a year and was constantly promised promotion, but it never happened. There was a lack of hours here as well, and my pay rate wasn't great."
good,"meet and greet, unload truck, walk sales floor, cashier, great place to start for retail."
good,everyone loves good jeans
good,I thoroughly enjoyed working with the team I helped build. We had a diverse and very fast paced crew. During this two years I felt that I build great connections that will last a lifetime.
good,"Prepare financial reports daily, process payroll weekly, train staff, assist store manager in daily functions. engage with customers, assist customers with merchandise selections and maintain a pleasant work environment"
good,The overall experience is ok but management demeanor and professionalism should be better.
good,"Fun workplace, but unreliable hours given to associates. But then again retail is unreliable. I need somewhere more stable."
good,a typical day at work was farely quiet.i learned how to work under pressure we always had a sales target for each working day.management at the store was ok.the co-workers were really nive to work with because we helped each other achieve the stores goals.to be honest there was not really any difficulty in working there.the most enjoyable part of the job was interracting with the customers.
good,"aided customers with merchandise ran merchandise to the sales floor,kept merchandise in order on the sales floor.i learned more on how to be honest to customers because i was mainly selling jeans.managment was very upbeatmy co workers were very laid back,they just did there job.the hardest part of the job was being honest to customers.what i enjoyed the most was styling customers and the diversity"
good,I like working for Levis. The management was great and the workplace is fast pace when it's the holidays. The hardest part is interacting with customers and the most enjoyable part is meeting someone new for the first time.
good,"gained lots of sales experience, worked with friendly people, improved people skills"
good,"I had a really good time working at Levis. All of my coworkers were really friendly and I felt like I was a part of a team. I wish I could've continued to work there, but hours weren't divided evenly among the employees."
good,Sales association provided by me was highly applauded by my team members and I was always appreciated for my patience dealing with customers who found hard to took their sakes decisions.
good,"Fast paste job with lots of questions"
good,"Great company overall with quality products. Some leaders could be more indulged/engaged with associate concerns. Space is a frequent issue at my store. Leadership can often come off overwhelmed. "
good,I love my job it’s layed back . But I don’t understand why we leave every night . We don’t get hours as we should . I thought my contract was a full time pay check . But I get a part time pay check I don’t understand stand the problem.
good,"I had no problem working with Levi's at all. All I can say the time I was there people were friendly, courteous & open to train. I pray the work place gotten better when I left years ago"
good,"Very fun and flexible, good for when you in school.  Not too great of pay but it gets you by. A typical day at Levi's consisted of what most retailers are, such as cleaning, helping guest, cashiering, and stocking. I learned how to handle customers with challenges, learned to work at quick pace. Management was helpful and nice. The culture was friendly."
good,"Hourly rate, paid holiday, uniform allowance and generous discounts are the best elements of the job."
good,"punch in ,check what needed to be stocked on sales floor go to back room get merchandise down make sure all items were tagged with correct prices put them on sales floor shelves,vacuum sales floor,receive in merchandise from truck drivers,change out blown bulbs in fixtures  . Learned this is not for me,Management okay at times, work place friendly to customer's, hardest part of job pleasing management of how I organized back room stock. enjoyable time of job leaving for the day then finding a different job not in the Salmon Run Mall."
good,"mi experiencia trabajando en esta empresa, fue grata, si bien creo yo lo que conforma en general a todo ámbito laboral relacionado a comercio necesita de mejoras, pero en este trabajo aprendí a cobrar en caja, controlar stock, a ser responsable de un turno y fundamentalmente a incentivarme en la búsqueda de un nuevo desafió laboral."
good,"I had a great team to work with at Levi, however the lack of commitment, communication, and direction we received being a brand new store ruined the experience for me overall. We were constantly stressed out and confused, always guessing what the right answer was and ultimately missing out on our own personal training and development. Being in the management role was especially difficult due to the fact that I never felt confident training and implementing store specific behaviors/ policies, because I was never even properly trained myself. The whole thing was very unfortunate."
good,"You will either love or hate this job depending on your situation in life. If you don't go to school and don't like socializing with anyone but your fellow employees, then this job will be perfect for you."
good,"This was generally a good place to work.. everyone was really friendly, but you get the drift immediately that full timers are used to seeing temps come and go. Management is friendly but they are very strict when it comes to ""productivity reports."""
good,"On a typical day one would help find products for customers. Also, there was some loss prevention done. "
good,"There is no typical day at work - everyday is always a different day. I've learned so much about the retail world by working for this company. I started seasonal, made a core member, a lead, PT supervisor with a DOR of women's visuals, to a FT supervisor in charge of men's look and service. There's a lot of opportunity to grow.  The hardest part of the job was the lack of current technology. If the company invested more TIME and money on updating technology, I believe the job would be more enjoyable. 90% of the issues that arise are due to the technology on hand. Most enjoyable part of the job is the visual freedom to merchandise."
good,"Great job if you need the money, hustling in this job is needed. Communicating with co-workers and managers. Speaking up for yourself should be a must."
good,"I have learned how to handle customers complaint with smiling face & with out attitude "
good,My co workers were great. I really connected with the team for the first few months. The consumers really know the product and quality of Levi's and Strauss.
good,"I enjoyed working at Levi because of the people and the atmosphere. I made alot of friends there and the work there was not difficult. Only reason why I left because job security, I was not making enough money to be stable"
good,"I enjoyed working for Levi's, my colleagues were really great people and the management were quick to help with any problem that i encountered and were great through my training."
good,"I was thrown into this position without knowing anything and coworkers were really busy to even train new employees.  "
good,"It's definitely diverse and it got me to learn about people and how to interact with them. Personally, I find it a tad bit hard to persuade someone to buy a pair of jeans. Others seem to have a knack for it, but I guess I haven't found my knack."
good,"In a nutshell, Levis Store is a good place to work, but not the type of place that can catarport me to the level i am aspiring for in life."
good,"Een typische dag bestond voornamelijk uit:"
good,"it was alright"
good,"i love working at levis strauss, a typical day at work would be just sizing jeans and making sure the walls look nice, and when a customer walks in help them find what they are looking for"
good,job requires alot of standing and non stop folding. pay is pretty low for  a well known brand.
good,"Part-time hours some 1st, 2nd, and 3rd shifts depending on the schedule. Check in with the managers and staff. Audit cashiers. Keep the sales floor in order."
good,"Uma Boa empresa com uma boa dinâmica ótima receptividade de funcionários e clientes, bom ambiente de trabalho, equipe unida e comprometido com o sucesso."
good,I have been treated well and am able to communicate with my superiors. There isnt a lot of room to grow though and management is constantly being changed
good,"This was my first retail job, and didn't know what to expect. I learned the basic stuff every retail job will teach you, how to fold the clothes properly, approach customers to make sales, help people buy the right jeans styles, cashier training, etc. What I didn't expect to learn was how much of a pain it can be to refold jeans and clean after customers destroy the store. The managers could be better organized, and communicate better. The discount you get is good, and you meet a lot of interesting people from all over the world."
good,Levi's has a place in my heart as being an amazing learning curve into getting into retail management and what it takes in that position.  I'm thankful for that
good,"It was very good and fun working there , it shows how excited people are for good clothing and quality. It was a good experience to work there and i would do it again."
good,"Levi's was very fun and busy.  The do offer benefits to full time staff.  The insurance is pretty expensive.  There systems need an upgrade, but overall a solid place to work."
good,"Everything was pretty par for the course as far as retail goes. I only got a 30 minute lunch, which kinda sucked. My managers were all pretty competent, and the company wasn't completely out of touch, which is nice."
good,"Friendly co-workers eager to assist and help colleagues, whether contractor or full-time staff. Always felt supported. Newly created seasonal position allowed me lot of freedom to create reports, spearhead teams, and have an impact on store efficiency."
good,"I do love my job here, however the management here is a concern. I feel as though I do not get valued enough for what i do. My contract is 8 hours and although i dont mind overtime, 25+ hours a week consistently is too much. Trying to balance A levels, work and a social life is hard."
good,The working hours were terrible when Christmas season wasn’t around. Definitely have to have a second job to work here but the coworkers and management made it fun and easy to work here.
good,LS and Co is overall a Good Company to work for with a polite work culture however the constant re-structuring of Geo's make it difficult to continue work at this company.
good,"在Levis裡我學到介紹公司的商品以及車縫這方面"
good,"I worked at Levi Strauss and Company over 14 years ago when they were going through layoffs.  They handled the transition period as best as any large company could, but for me, the amount of change and uncertainty going through several years of reorganizing was difficult.  It was prosperous for some.  Overall, the company is a great place to work and a long standing American brand.  I would stand behind them any day."
good,"Work days can be tiring, Overtime can be murder, the pay isn't fair, Coworkers can make the days go by easier and faster when cooperating and working together."
good,"My first retail job. I was in high school and I also played basketball, this job helped me learn how to manage my time as I juggled practice, work, and my school work. I learned how to handle heavy traffic within the store and enhanced my customer service."
good,Entreprise tres agréable . Intéressement au chiffres . Possibilité d'évolution .
good,"good I leaded visual merchandising, inventory monthly reports,"
good,you learn how to inspect clothes and price clothes you meet a lot of great people its in a great location great parking good vacation hours good holiday pay and you get a chance to see a lot of different styles of clothes
good,during the hoildays it is very tiring can make you want to quit at times but the mangers are very nice besides the lady joseline
good,Over all about company to work for with great benefits but no security and not Enough hrs are given hours are based off of how long you work there then performance and work ethic.
good,"Very hard to move up in the company"
good,co-workers are fun and a typical day is conversing with the customers and assisting them in making decisions. The diversity of people you see and get to meet are great.
good,"Great management, great work environment and over all one of the best jobs I ever had.  But, Levi went the way of your typical large company and outsourced.  Other, than that it was an amazing job."
good,"Trabalho fácil e agradável porém cansativo, as vezes ficando até 10 horas de trabalho sem paradas exceto 10 minutos para lanche, apenas 2 vezes por dia, ou seja 20 minutos de descanso e 9 horas e 40 minutos de trabalho."
good,"Apertura de tienda"
good,"With an educated and committed team, LS & Co offers the ability to advance into ever more challenging roles and to be creative in your current role.  Unfortunately, some of the strongest and most developmental managers have left the company due to the almost yearly reorganizations."
good,"From the second I walk into the office, I go nonstop til I leave. My day is filled with cross-functional meetings with Merchandising, Operations, Website and Creative Development teams ensuring that Dockers.com is performing at a high level. Due to company changes, I have stepped up as acting Manager for my Digital Marketing team since November 2013 and currently reporting to the Marketing Director of Global Ecommerce. "
good,A typical work day went by pretty slow. I learned a few more things about customer service. 
good,Levi is a fun and relaxed place to work. I learned that levi offered some of the best quality when it comes to jeans. The management wasnt that great but it could have changed of the years.
good,"I loved the atmosphere of the managment and coworkers it helped build my confidence in the work that I do. We would clean up the store, help customers find what they need, learn all the fits, work the registers and stock the shelves. The hardest part was more on my end than what the job required. I had bad habits from a previous position that I had to work through to atop it from interfering with my work. The most enjoyable parts were the closeness of the team."
good,"A ""truly"" global company with strong culture, diverse workforce and complex systems / work flows."
good,Levi is a great place to learn and grow. I was working with a team that invovled in overseeing all testing and SAP ALM suite.
good,I would stock shelves with jeans & fold shirts the entire shift. Management was understanding & very nice. Coworkers were very nice. They usually only have seasonal job opportunities available.
good,It was a cool first job. The people I worked with were cool. It was an easy job just maintaining a clean store and help out customers. There are some customers that tend to get kinda rude but it didn't bother me I just did my job. Some days were busy and some days were slow usually when the weather would be bad. Overall its a cool first job and you can learn a lot about the company which is cool to know.
good,"It was a good first company job. Meeting people from across the globe who come to shop for clothes was fun. Showing new product, introducing it, and assisting in any way possible."
good,Muy organizados exelente ambiente de trabajo pero sueldo muy bajo
good,"The company does a great job outlining details of your expected daily duties and has an efficient method of training any new employees. The culture is very relaxed and you can see this in all aspects of the company, for example, some members of corporate from San Francisco are covered in tattoos. The company makes daily work fun, however, there can be problems amongst upper management that can cause serious problems on a day to day basis."
good,"HORRIBLE AC conditions. Always kept temperatures extremely cold. "
good,Levi's keeps you busy and also offers over-time. I enjoyed the working environment and I also made several friends there. There are plenty of opportunities to advance and to switch departments.
good,"During my times working there in Levis,i learned a lot like to be productive and how to deal to different kind of people,and its really good experience for me working there.And the management and all staff i worked before its good and nice people.Theres a times they experience under pressure especially in holidays and have sales so the shops are so busy but eventhough were busy u will not feel the tiredness because were really enjoy in our work.And i want to improve my skill more,if we giving me a chance to hired in future work."
good,The work culture was friendly and mostly everyone got along. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help people find what they needed and having the be satisfied. The hardest part of my job was dealing with those who didn't speak English therefor there would be miscommunication. I was able to learn how to interact with others who had different views and opinions.
good,"A typical day is fast paced, productive and target driven, you work with a great team of shop floor staff.  The store management are approachable but often allow target pressures to impact on work/life balance and are often inflexible."
good,Felt like I was doing was getting paid to fold. Seemed like very little actual sales situations with customers.  So we folded jeans and shirts after customers picked them up and put them down. Also the discount caught me a little off guard. Same deal as anyone else who walked through the door on a sale day. Could be found at many other retailers for less.
good,"It is a great company to work at. "
good,"It is an easy and fun job to do. There is a lot of interaction with the customer. There is a lot of fixing of the clothes, which passes the time fast. My mangagers do their job well and are very easy to talk to. My coworkers are fun and make the work place fun to be at, they are also easy to talk to and very helpful to everyone. The hardest part of this job would be trying to get a customer who is just looking to actually buy something especially when they do not want anyone's help. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to help someone find their perfect pair of jeans that make them feel happy, also being able to have good conversations with the customer."
good,"It was an extremely busy environment to always be in. "
good,I enjoyed being a supervisor very much. I did what I could to be a positive role model to younger employees when they worked my shift. I enjoyed most of my co-workers here but the other managment was hard to deal with.
good,"I was recruited to come and open a new store in Texas and was hired as a Full-Time Supervisor responsible for the Look or Visuals of the store! The first few months were fun and exciting and everyone seemed to be nice, only working with a store manager and another full time supervisor! But things took a turn for the worst when people could not focus on their work and brought personal feelings to the job! But a typical day was me checking emails in the morning and checking store performance, setting up charts, looking for promotions! The bonuses we received as managers for our store reaching goals was great! The hardest part were interacting with people who had no management experience."
good,"I had to give a good customer service,learned how to handle different tkinds of people.people came and left in management and some of them m made an impact in my life and I can't help to think about what could have happened if they were still there.my co-workers were great and we enjoyed working together and more than anything we were a team.hardest part of the job was when we have to reach our target and in that moment we don't have selling stock,when we make orders and don't receive those orders in time.at times we present ideas to the management and they will just crush them withoud a good explanation.my most enjoyable moment was that I could dress up anyhow in my levis jeans everyday,levis made me more of a fashionista and most of all enjoyed the incentives when we reached our target."
good,Working at Levis is fun and the management is great but the work hours are low.
good,"The clothes are amazing, you can look how ever you like. The company waited 7 weeks to give me my check."
good,Dla ludzi bez zobowiazan. Dobre warunki finansowe.
good,A typical day at work was just standing around or folding clothes the whole day. Can't make a decision without asking the manager and getting it approved.
good,I learn how to fold and restock store. Being a merchandiser you learn to the new style of clothing and you had to keep the store at a certain style to catch the customer eye to buy.
good,"The other day, I took a career assessment, which told me I should be a maritime merchant. I’m not quite sure what that is, but it did get me thinking: A role that combines my skills in business development with my lifelong passion for the ocean would be my absolute dream. Which is how I found this role at Royal Caribbean."
good,Selling jeans was not a bad job at all. All the people I worked with did seem a little off. They were fake and had some liars in the work area but I kept to myself and stayed away from the gossip.
good,"A typical work day at Levi's includes opening and closing the store, making daily and weekly deposits, managing the sales team, coaching and training the staff members, visuals and merchandising."
good,it was very nice at my location managers were respectful and encouraged me. they were very strict on maintaining a sales percentage of over one item per sale. if you don't mind working retail its as good a job as any
good,"Gosto de trabalhar com o publico."
good,modeling and selling the brand to customers. showing what the look is based on and how to wear the product.
good,I lover everyone that worked here.  it taught me a lot to help with time management. I like the managers they were nice. they do this thing where if we sell enough or higher than others we get a free item
good,"very productive and straining but great working environment  never a dull moment with staff they very friendly and out spoken, management is great and very understanding and paitient,but very much target driven as we all are,a day at Levi Strauss outlet is basically to ensure that all parts of our KPI's is inforced and for our store to perform on its best capabilty everyday we are Levis Strauss leading outlet store because our sales team is beyond target driven and self motivated and that is the most enjoyable part of this job knowing you exciding beyond your limit and getting rewarded for it,hardest part of the job is replening the store on a busy weekend."
good,I worked at this job the longest. It was fun at times and I really liked the people I worked with. They didn't give the best hours which made it kind of not fun to work there but other than that it was a good job.
good,"Typical day is re-folding everything that has been tried on, explaining different fits to customers, learning product information daily, and tidying up the store after hours"
good,"La verdad es un trabajo muy padre, muy divertido, siempre me habia gustado la marca de Levis entonces el tener la oportunidad de trabajar ahi se me hizo algo maravilloso, aprendi demaciadas cosas, el poco tiempo que estuve laborando ahi lo disfrute mucho y cada semana nos daban capacitacion, teniamos que estar super bien preparados para cualquier pregunta que pudiera tener un cliente, asi como tambien nosotros adentrarnos mas en la marca y ofrecer una mejor experiencia"
good,Levis was a nice place to work. I recommend it to teenagers who are looking for a part-time job to help out. The only thing negative was probably standing on your feet all day.
good,"For being my first seasonal job, was a great environment which helped me become more outgoing and understanding towards customers who come into the store"
good,"very fun experience. You can learn while having fun as well. Genuinely nice people to work with, understanding management, scheduling and hours aren't really much to live off of."
good,"A typical day at work will be selling lots of clothing, meeting great new people. my co workers were great to work with."
good,"Fast-paced work environment, must be quick on your feet. Customer service is key, good organizational skills also help. Bilinguals have an advantage, overall a good working experience."
good,"!ATTENTION LEVI'S FRANCHISE!"
good,"The job itself was not a bad job; however, the temp agency that staffed us there didn't tell us how bad the shifts would be. I was on weekend shift from 5 AM to 5;30 PM from Friday through Sunday. The problem with the shift is that I lived so far away that by the time I got home, took a shower, and went to sleep, I was getting less than 8 hours of sleep and having to go back into work and expected to get numbers beyond 100%. The trainers there are very nice; however, they are not very helpful in times of need. They always seem to be gone when you need help even though there is supposed to be 1 trainer per pod at all times."
good,I love the atmosphere as long as the managers werent trolling. The good one left fir new jobs die to the lack of advancement in the company. I left for the same reason.
good,"nice place to work whilst i was studying in college"
good,"Overall it was a fun place to work, but tasks are not properly delegated. Therefore making it very hard for the store to stay organized. Management isn't always around when needed to properly assist associates and customers."
good,Fun work place with great interaction with the customers. The employees are fun and knowledgeable of the product and helpful. The most enjoyable part of work is getting to know the people that come in to Levis because they come from all over the world so getting to know so many different cultures in that little bit of time is really cool.
good,if you are looking for your first job I defiantly recommend working here it was great start to building real world working social skills while making some cash and having some fun as well.
good,The people care about each other. There are many activities to show appreciation of the employees. I enjoyed my time there.
good,"Aprendi muito foi uma escola, a maior dificuldade era a carga horaria 10 horas por dia segunda a sabado e dois domingos por mes."
good,"a typical day working at levis is a fast pace, exciting working environment and theres always jeans to fold! Customer service is the very important. Making sure we greet customers and answer lots of questions. i learned a lot from this job such as measuring a person waist to find the right fitted jeans for them, using the registers, housekeeping, answering phones calls and being organized. the first day working here at levis my co workers were so friendly and nice, everyone was very helpful and still are. the hardest part of levis was trying to find customers to measure lots of customers were very shy. the most enjoyable part of the job was that everyone works together and gets the job done!"
good,Many of the managers are all over the place and lack communication. They vote on who they want to keep and who they want to stay with is based on personal preference and not skill.
good,"I enjoyed working here, but during peak season you would have to work mandatory overtime of 45 or more days straight. Management showed favoritism, but if you can get past that, it was an ok place to work"
good,Levi's is a fast pace job where people need to be aware of the store because it can be very busy or it can be dead the mangers seem to get bored and not pick
good,"They have treated me well throughout the years. However, if you are looking for a job with consistent hours this may not be the best fit for you. Instead of giving hours to the employees that have the experience they over staff and give all their employees 12-16 hours a week."
good,"I only spent a few months at Levis due to being seasonal, but I enjoyed my experience. I worked at the North Outlet there are tons of tourists from all around the world making your day very interesting! And at times challenging due to language barriers...Id say during the holidays its great fast pace busy. On an average month it can be very slow. overall a very chill place to work!"
good,I had fun working at Levi. I had 4 managers and 2 out 4 of them made the work environment fun. it is definitely a stressful environment that is fast paced.
good,"I loved working for Levi Strauss and I loved the knowledge and background of the position. You get one free item if you make the month and a great discount. The only complaint was my management. But, other than that, it was a fantastic job and the friends I made there are still with me today."
good,"The location I work at is very small, my boss is very specific about the way he wants his employees to work. The people I work with are all very nice though!"
good,"Era um tipo de trabalho sobre Pressão, eu aprendi coisas que nunca tinha visto peguei o tipo do serviço muito fácil . "
good,"The Showroom was Really Good & the management was good."
good,"Il est difficile d'émettre un avis objectif."
good,Customer service is important. Helping others is great and fun.
good,"The day was always on the go always something to do ,very fast paced ,management was ok everything by the book ,co workers were always diffrent there were alot of employees,hardest part of the job mot enough hrs to go along ,most enjoyable the customer all the peolpe from all parts of the world"
good,Easy going employees and management and easy to learn sales and styles.  Everyone that works there knows what they're doing and are keen on helping those that are new to the company. Lead by example.
good,Good times. I worked with Levi Straiss and Company in the past. I was in my late teens. I actually met a girl there and I still feel like I like her and that she likes me. Work is not a good place to find companionship. Good job regarding late teens.
good,"While working here, we had way too many people working and very few shifts for each person. The pay was great for someone who was a part time student but I had one shift a week and I was lucky that I had two other jobs."
good,"A typical day at work would include me communicating with my co-workers, and consumers to complete a sale. "
good,"Management turnover was the worst.  There was a lack of ability to learn due to unwillingness of MIC to teach proper procedures.   He/she wanted the job done their way.  However, LS&Co was an awesome place to work and the history of this company is remarkable."
good,"The employees and management truly care about their coworkers/staff. Everything is done with a team effort. Very likable and fun environment. They hardest part of the job is the weekends. They are typically faster-paced than the week days. You have more consumers that need assistance and occasionally not enough employees to help divide out the work. The easiest part of the job is shipment and cashwrap during the weekdays, The week days are usually more laid-back and not has fast-paced compared to the weekends."
good,"A typical day at Levi's consisted of what most retailers are, such as cleaning, helping guest, cashiering, and stocking. I learned how to handle customers with challenges, learned to work at quick pace. Management was helpful and nice. The culture was friendly."
good,Durante mi estadía en la empresa no tuve ningún inconveniente ni con el personal ni con las instalaciones. El único inconveniente fueron la falta de prestaciones y beneficios.
good,It's a great high school job. You get to work with friends and learn about the working life. You get to meet people from around the work depending on your stores location. Some customers are hard to work with but most are understanding.
good,"I joined because of their Brand.   I have lived in Levis my entire life.  But, not a place for IT and they have some technology, advancement, and diversity issues within IT.   This seems specific only to IT, not the larger company."
good,"I really enjoyed working with them when I first started, there was job variety and all staff were friendly and motivated. There was a management change, and it was no longer run in the same way, and they were no longer as willing to accomidate needs in terms of hours that could be worked by certain employees."
good,In the 1990s the management rage was re-engineering. The management of this company led their re-engineering effort (with the help of a large global consulting firm then Anderson Consulting) as a large manufacturing business rather than a premium global brand icon. The goals of their re-engineering efforts failed to honor its two greatest assets: its brands and its people.
good,Co-workers were amazing. Flexible hours. Min wage pay. After awhile we got new management and it wasn't the same anymore. You really do build a family while working there !
good,"good company and exemplary to work in this company, suits to work those who loved to balance there office work and family."
good,"At Levi, day pass with lots of challenges and task to accomplish. "
good,"This job was very relaxed, it was very slow paced. The managers were really helpful let alone outgoing. Just like their employees worked they worked along side with them."
good,"Levis is an organized system with a steady work flow on the weekends.  Not many customers through out the week.  I not only learned the jean numbers, but how to speak to people.  Sometimes this is an awkward experience for some customers, other times they are just confused, to help make their decision easier is satisfying.  It was hard to work the busy days when there's a lack of employees.  This job requires employees to be proactive and attentive.  I liked getting to know my co workers and to help people feel confident in the jeans they want."
good,"With all the part-time jobs that I have had throughout my life, my team at Levi Strauss & Co. was definitely the best I have ever had. My team has taught me a lot of lessons during and after I was working there. I learned how to analyze my thoughts and actions more carefully, I learned how to tolerate and work with different types of people that I meet throughout the day, I learned to care for others without question, I learned that maintaining a good relationship with your co-workers makes one a better, stronger, and healthier person in and outside of the workplace. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to get to know your co-workers more and more and becoming friends with them. The hardest part of the job was definitely being challenged on your flaws and trying to get pass them."
good,"It's hard work which I don't mind, but often times did not feel appreciated.  No real room for advancement, poor leadership and mentorship. Company was fun though."
good,"Great working models but no full time positions and lots of turn over in working positions. Customer service models are great but few employees implement them with bad leads and favoritism being an issue at this store so there is more time spent worrying about sales percentages and buddying to the ""right"" people. "
good,"I worked at Levi Strauss full-time (More than a year)"
good,J'ai travaillé pendant la préparation de mon diplôme Bts Muc en alternance. Ce n'était pas un poste qui me convenait à long terme.
good,boas referencias e perspectiva de futuro só com exigências de atuar fora da cidade
good,"Levi's was a great job that I will never forget. I love the company, love the product, and loved helping people find their fit. However, Levi's doesn't seem to care as much as they should about their employees. After over 2 years with the company, I'm still bumping up in pay only as minimum wage increases. Not only is this poor employee loyalty on the companies part, but I led me to dread work, with little motivation to try hard."
good,I betyered my customer service skills and the reading of people better and what they like. The manager that left was amazing and the new one that took her place only gave hours to the men that worked there.
good,This is my first job in my life and from this job i learned the customer service and the ability of judge the mentality of the customer and understand what customer really want.
good,"Actividades de Visual Merchandiser y también ocasionalmente Assistant Manager."
good,Work with clients on a daily basis to create a highly individualistic shopping experience for the consumer. This is achieved through training and the focus on client needs and executing on these needs.
good,"I enjoyed my position while it lasted, Levi's can be a great company however there values on helping current employees advance is very weak. 15+ employees laid off, next week Levi's 49er Stadium announced, very disheartening. Pay is good compared to other companies as well as compensations but I would never think you are safe unless you are an intricate part of Levi's. Great to have on resume other than that not much going on. Each year company rethinks everything and cuts many jobs, while continuing to spend money on other aspects that do not have any ROI."
good,Levi Strauss was a fast paste work place alot to learn. The work was very stressful but you learning at the same time.The best thing about working at Levi was the bucket sale for the employees every 3months
good,"Laid-back yet competitive job. Learned how to persuade people even when they've repeatedly said they don't need assistance, use a cashier, and move with a purpose throughout the entire work day. Co-workers and Managers were down to earth and willing to coach each and every employee to become a better sales associate. There was nothing hard about this job, and the most enjoyable part of this job was interacting with new people on a daily basis."
good,i had the most fun working at Levi's & Strauss in Downtown Seattle
good,"When I first got hired it was wonderful. Good team, good discounts and very relaxed. However as time goes on the girls can be catty and gossipy. The manager seems to pick favorites and she'll  cut your hours before even stating to you what needs to be worked on and work with you on improving. However the assistant manager is wonderful and fair. Sometimes I believe she should of been in charge"
good,"- Freies Selbstständiges arbeiten möglich"
good,"Bonne équipe, bon management, entreprise dynamique"
good,Levis warehouse is very competitive. Just like anywhere else you have expectations you have to meet. The pay isnt too bad as well. Its enough to live off of.
good,Working at Levi Strauss outlet was my first job so my perspective might be different from everyone else’s.  It’s ok to work there if you like competitiveness.
good,"Environnement de travail très agréable, mais Contrat à courte durée pour en juger davantage"
good,"No hay ascensos, ni las comisiones son muy buenas pero el ambiente laboral es muy bueno los jefes son muy amables y te brindan mucho apoyo"
good,"Atleast in regards To cabazon. Team was good and You really learn how to sell. You actually get to socialize and if you work hard enough you will actually move up. You have to be assertive if you do however and for the most part hours are ok. Mostly recommended for Young teens in high school or younger college students. Not aomething you can live off of."
good,"As a whole, I loved working at Levi’s. But management made it terrible for me. They looked out for each other but never their workers which sucks because we’re just as important as the managers. The pay was great. Starting salary was great for me because I was only 17 at the time. Then it increased by $1.50 in 8 months. Great first job in all honesty."
good,Um bom local para começar a trabalhar e aprender mais sobre vendas e contacto com o público
good,great place to work but if work get slow you will be laid off if your the last to get hired the people there makes you feel like family all the times.
good,"working hard an putting the interest of the customers first .team work is very important ,targets must be reached .be dedicated always be  on tym due to the amount of work needed for us to do..punctuality is important"

good,"It was good"
good,"I loved working for LS&Co and hopefully would like to return eventually. If you’re promoted within the pay is pretty low, but being hired from outside you can get better pay. Management in my particular store was great except for the store manager who was very unproductive and pushed all of their responsibilities onto the rest of management while they played on their phone/computer in the back room."

good,"Levi is a great company that gets all employees involved in amazing give back to the community events and causes. The company has great things to offer. To bad my experience there was with a little overzealous micro managing tyrant that made my work environment  bad one filled with hostility, he did not promote a team environment but bullied his staff and managers to bend to his will."

good,"La comunicación y el trato con los clientes eran mi mayor motivación es Levi's. Al saber idiomas trataba no solo con los clientes españoles si no con todos los clientes extranjeros venidos de todo el mundo, con una cultura y un trato totalmente dispares entre unos y otros. En mi caso soy una chica bastante interesada en el mundo del arte y de la moda, por lo que el asesoramiento en tienda y el estilismo es algo que me motivaba mucho y que se me daba bastante bien. Duplicaba frecuentemente el tarjet del día a diferencia de mis compañeros y cada finde semana me intentaba superar más. El ambiente con los compañeros era muy distendido lo que facilitaba aun más el trabajo. "
good,The holiday season came around such as christmas time and the store started to get busy so most of the employees had to start multitasking. While helping one customer find jeans you would have to listen to another customer talk about the type of jeans they wanted and size then go help them
good,"Great camaraderie amongst coworkers, very friendly co-workers. There are a lot of changes to the product itself, keeping you on your toes.  But you get to learn a lot from the whole process, because there is definitely a lot of problem solving needed."
good,I really enjoyed everyone who worked here. We all got along and I met some really amazing people. The managers are also laid back but still want you to do your work. The only thing I did not like was the pay and the little room to move up in the company.

good,"Everyday work was always different and fun. The managers showed they cared about their employees and customers. The salary and commissions were rightfully distributed. There was no hard part of the job except standing for long hours, but regardless time went by really fast when you enjoy your workplace."
good,Levi's seems like it wants to be and thinks of itself as a little better than most retail companies. They have their sales people focus on being genuine and you get the feeling that they are trying to do the right thing as much as they can. At the end of the day though it's still a job as a sales associate.
good,"great environment, my co-workers were great, fun to work with. The company allows you to be fully yourself as long as the job is being completed. Was able to grow within the company."

good,"Travailler pour le pionnier du jean est une fierté et demande beaucoup de sérieux, de professionnalisme et d'implication."
good,"A typical day at work involves coming in ready and willing to flex and adapt to the environment, consumers, and traffic. Management leads us well, tells us what our goals should be and explains what retail trends to expect. Management is great as far as being professional and enjoyable to work under. Fellow stylists and stock employees are all with you in striving to make the best experience for a consumer. Hours are based on availability and performance (the better you do, the more hours you recieve) so it's good if you're doing well but also can become difficult to deal with personal issues when you work so much. It's so gratifying to help people and be able to use the knowledge you have to be able to provide the best customer experience someone has ever had. It's also very cool to see the different kinds of consumers that love the company and to meet them and become their friend for a short time."
good,"A typical day at Levi's would start off with me greeting customers when they came in and informing them of the different types of promotions we have. I would also measure women so they can find their ideal jean type to make their buy more personalized and suited for their body type. I would also be out on the floor, when I was done with my greeting time, and be in action by helping customers. I would find their jeans and sizes and lead them to the fitting rooms. I learned to always keep a smile on my face as it attracts customers to you. A friendly face is like honey! Also, I learned how to speak out more. Levi's was a very big store so I didn't know EVERYONE that was working there. I only knew the people who I always shared shifts with and they were good people. The hardest part of the job was trying to make sales and make the sales goal. It was like a competition with yourself. But, I will always be proud of that one day where I made the highest sales. I talked and smiled a lot that day to customers. My jaw was hurting! It was worth it because i got that gold sticker. The most enjoyable part was meeting people from all around the world. There were a lot of tourists looking for jeans. I met people from Jamaica, France, Spain, Russia, Argentina, etc. My favorite people were the old ladies because they reminded me of my grandmother. They were so cute. All in all it was a good experience especially since this was my first job."

good,"a typical day at levis would be serving customers trying to hit the days targets as a team! when the shop was quiet we had to stay motivated to do the smaller jobs that were required of us such as replenishment on the floor. from levis i learned alot about perfecting my customer service role and how to deal with all types of people. the hardest part of my job wouold be for me when the day was quiet and trying to stay self motivated aswel as motivating others, the most enjoyable however would be the responsibility of being part of the management team as i felt trusted by my manager to run the store and do a good job with it."
good,I enjoyed my short time at Levi's as I learnt a lot of new skills and practises while I was there. The staff were very welcoming and helpful in teaching me the ropes. An overall good experience.

good,A typical day at work consisted of folding jeans and making the store presentable. From working at Levi's I learned how to communicate better and socialize with customers and fellow employees. Management at Levi's seemed to have their hands full all the time. My fellow co-workers were helpful since the management team had a lot on their plates. The hardest part of the job was the repetitive nature of the work. The most enjoyable part of the job was being to work with a lot of people.

good,"Working here was great!  Lots of fun, management was great, employees are very nice and like to help you out, everyone treats each other like family.  However, they never schedule all the people they hire.  There would be a week or 2 that went by before I had one shift, and I was often sent home early due to slow business and too many people on the floor."

good,"Being in retail, you work a lot with people you've never met before. Some don't always speak the same language as you, or may not understand what you're trying to sell them. But helping them understand and receive the best care while they are in the store is what should be focused on. Answering their questions, and going beyond their expectations. My favorite part of working at Levi's was meeting all sorts of people. Young, old, and everything inbetween. My coworkers were also a lot of fun to be around, and extremely helpful when I myself had questions."
good,Levi's is great Icon brand with a wonderful historical story.  Leaders in the Denim industry.

I was able to develop presence and made sure to lead by example. My consistency in operational tasks allowed me to become a point person in the training of new cashiers and even managers at the cash wrap. There was always at least two difficult consumers per day but this taught me patience. The most enjoyable part of the job was reaping the benefits of delivering consistent results."
good,Fast paced production facility.  Learned to work in the production based facility.  Also learned how important productivity was to the company.  Management worked well with employees.

Ook buiten het werk wordt er met elkaar omgegaan."
good,Working with this company I learned how to be fast paced with helping customers and also making them feel welcome and at ease at the same time.

The employees are very kind and friendly and make the environment welcoming with their positive attitudes and greeting smiles.

good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is managing all the aspects of a popular retail store in daily base. From this work place, I  learned about how to be a good manager with eyes opening."
good,"total mixed feelings about this place. worked there for almost 2 years and yet they never offered to give me any sort of advancement. My experience and knowledge were probably one of the best and all I was known for is folding shirts. People who had been there significantly less time than I ended being in a management position while I remained a sales associate. I really did love the people though, it made the work environment fun although the drama was substantial. And not to mention, if you got on the managers bad side, they'd lower your hours"

good,"Iconic company, great culture to work at. There are great people that you will be working with, just like in any company there are some problems."
good,When I started this was a great company to work for. I have learned a lot with Levi's and grew tremendously. A lot of people were laid off and the workload was overwhelming.
good,At Levi Strauss Co. everyone contributed. Every employee added value to unmatched products. Everyone was always friendly and ready to help.
good,cette expérience a été un véritable tremplin dans ma carrière professionnelle
good,"Working in Levis was a good Experience. It's a big brand but some times you really go through a lot, dealing with the tough customers. Yes, it was a tough job but i learnt alot. This job polished my customer care skills, made me way more friendly. It was a good experience."

good,"A normal day working at levis would be helping customers find there way around the wide range of different jean styles that we had to offer, friendly interactions and to quickly find what the costumer is looking for. I learned didnt peoples background as it was a hugely diverse place to work at with my tourists as well. The hardest part of the job was probably just the communication, with so many different tourists coming from all over the world and some of which dont spek english at all, it becomes challenging to speak with your hands and try to mime out the actions to help them out. The most enjoyable part of the job was just the coworkers i had, everybody was friendly and just great fun to be around, it was a lovely vibe."
good,"* Business support by keeping the IT landscape up and responsive."

good,"Great starter job to get into retail, really enjoy the company and its goals in providing an exceptional customer experience. However the location am working at isn't the best due to poor management."
good,I enjoyed working at levis the experience was great overall no bad remarks.
good,I had to open and close tills and the end of the day. worked as a team. i had to make sure all employees followed company dress code and policies. We would usually set up goals and quotas for the day and we compensated employees with small gifts. I had to handle most guest inquires when in distress. It was a very high volume store. What I liked the most about working there was the people I met and the experience I gained from it. The hardest part I would say were holidays were very hectic and I had to work long hours and train a lot of new employees.
good,"I had an excellent first working experience at Levi's. The management there had high standards for both the store and it's employee's which was beneficial to me because I wasn't just standing around not caring like I see a lot in the retail industry. We always had to be doing something whether it was assisting customers or straightening up the store. If we were seen not doing our job there were consequences which was kind of stupid but in the long run it was all for the best.. when I look back in retrospect, I understand why the management did what they did... it might be the retail industry but it's nice to see managers who are actually passionate about their job. I understand that you can really work your way up, you might be a manager or a sales associate at one point, but if you work hard enough in retail you can move pretty far up in whatever company you work for and I'm referring to moving up to the corporate part of the company."
good,I'm currently an Hi-Lo operator i stock in pick orders in in a productive manner. I've learned many things here like driving the hostler truck which is used to move semi trailers to in from the dock. The management is okay my co-workers are good team workers. Its not a hard part of the job everything is easy. what i like most about this job is the benefits.
good,"-I love working w/ them coz they're so happy to be w/ even there's a time of misunderstanding regarding to the work."
good,"Good Work culture and Job satisfaction,best Brand and good products"
good,"-Team oriented"
good,"Levi is a good company to work for. When I worked there they had 3 12 hour shifts on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. Ultimately, they took out their weekenders so that the other shifts could meet their hours. 1st shift was that hardest shift to get on. Majority of them had been there for years. they had better hours, but less pay. 2nd shift paid better, but worked the later hours. But, who could turn down $5 Levi's twice a year?"
good,I learned how to maintain control in a fast-paced environment and interact with customers and co-workers.
good,"good company,great customers and last but not least best service from the whole entire stuff"
good,"Perfect for college students. It was a very chill, laid back atmosphere where you got paid to wear jeans everyday."

good,"fue enriquecedor para mi ya me pude desenvolver de la mejor manera en mis funciones como encargada de la tienda, con un buen manejo de mis capacidades y dando un buen trato a los vendedores y parte administrativa."
good,"At Levi Strauss & Co., I had a lot of positive and great experiences with customers, I really enjoyed working with people like me and not so much like me because it gave me the experience to work with a great amount of different people and cultures. I had a few encounters with some customers being inappropriate, but overall I enjoyed working at Levi Strauss & Co."
good,"Levi Strauss & Co. allowed you to express yourself through your own unique style, and was a fun environment to work in. They motivated you to hit sales goals, while making sure even in a large and fast paced store location, each employee felt as if they were an important part of the team."
good,Management was great and they actually want to help. The perks were amazing. 40-50% of all items. associates were nice if you were nice other then that levis is a good first job
good,Even in a changing environment of retail the company works hard to stay true to the belief in work/life balance.  They are focused on making an impact on the communities in which we work and do job functions.  Some companies just talk about their impact but LS&Co does focus on it from recycling of product to protecting water.   They also are very supportive of the employees when there is an emergency situation in life they are there to assist through a foundation that is built through employees helping employees.
good,I enjoyed my time there and would recommend it to people who like fast paced organizing and social interaction with customers. The casual wear was also a plus.
good,For the most part I have fun working there. I love interacting with the customers and my co workers . The only thing Is that I’m not giving enough hours. I’ve changed my avalibility and I’m still only working weekends.
good,Great place to work. It is fast paced but that makes the day go by quickly. It is a great group of people that you work with every day and all are looking to help you accomplish your goals.
good,Was a good job for learning about people skills and how a work environment with a lot of people should work. i much prefer working technically with my hands and figuring out how things work. Otherwise a good experience. Hours could be better.
good,Great company to work for with long interesting history. The only struggle was they are behind on technology. Using multiple platforms and dated platforms are time consuming and make management of metrics and returns a struggle.
good,"Working on CADs, technical sketches/tech packs, mood boards, fittings, fabric sourcing, up dating data on PLM"
good,"I don't really have any negatives towards the company per se, more so the way I have been utilized as a worker. Management showed favoritism and didn't really know how to work with Students of any level (especially high school student-athletes)."
good,The environment is relaxed but fast passed. I really like having my own station and feeling like I am part of the team. Management doesn't give great feedback and don'tfeel like they really care.
good,"Good growth opportunity "
good,"Really its very comfortable to work over in levis bcause every one is very friendly and jovial. main think is levis alway focus on product knowledge.they have separate trainer for every 10 store's,monthly two time's they will visit to every store and will give training about product then they will ask questions and roll play about product."

good,"Levi's in Times Square is not one of my favorite jobs, but it is a fun place to be... sometimes. The managers are nice for the most part and will do their best to look out for you if you need help."
good,"- Typical day would be managing a section at the store and helping customers."
good,"I enjoyed working a Levi's, I respected all managers. Once a week we would get a test on the product knowledge to be able to know more about levi's history and background. I enjoyed learning a lot of the history of the jeans and type of denim. How ever I did not like the hours, they would only schedule me twice a week."
good,"enjoyed the people i worked with. Good job for young people. most supervisors were okay. all different types of work. ex: stock, register, maintenance, handy work."
good,Es un buen ambiente de trabajo las manejadoras son super buena onda y flexibles con el horario para estudiantes
good,Levis is a good place to work especially if you stay with the company for a long time. You learn so many things about the company and just how much they have helped shape fashion and the mechanics of blue jeans themselves.
good,I learned how to work as a team for goals that are set upon us by the head office. How to make sales quotas while having fun. A great organization to work for.
good,"Start up feel."
good,My review about working in this company that i decided that i wanted to join soon. Management is absolutely credible and i learned few things for me to have a better mindset of this company
good,Overall a fantastic company to work for.... However this is the first year for HR to be in house and so there is no job security at this time. That might change later on.
good,"easy atmosphere to work in, all employees work well together, family oriented store where you could outfit and be a personal stylist for all members of the family"
good,"Great job if you like the quality jeans and denim wear as well as leather goods. It was a great first job for myself."
good,"Excelente empresa multinacional, que por estar inciando as atividades no Brasil oferecia grandes possibilidades de progressos dentro da própria organização. Aquí no Brasil eram uns 40 funcionários e todos estavam satisfeitos com a empresa. Tinha um refeitório com cozinheira e ambulatório médico dentro das dependências da empresa."
good,"- ouverture du magasin 10h, rangement des rayons, réassort, entretien de ventes avec les clients, conseiller les clients, aider les clients à faire le bon choix, encaissement, pause de 1h,  fin de la journée à 18h. fermeture du magasin à 21h pour ceux ayant commencer à 14h."
good,"A fast adapting environment with easy to get along with employees, will have roles that are different from job description, fair management, strict up to par policy with guidelines on work curriculum and opportunities to learn new things."
good,Het behalen van doelstellingen en KPI's werkt motiverend en uitdagend. Collega's staan voor elkaar klaar en er wordt goed gecommuniceerd binnen het team.
good,"I worked for a franchise partner for 9 of my 10 years for Levis and found that it was the best job I have ever had, the culture was amazing caring interesting with lots of role variation and job progression opportunities"
good,"The job its' self is the best job i've ever had, the staff were fun and easy to get on with and very welcoming. The job offered alot of chances to advance even within the store, even offering varying types of training for all sorts of tailoring work to part time staff. The pay was great but the only problem I found was awful management with the store manager often picking at people and creating an uncomfortable work environment. This came to effect my home time as they would make it appear to be unacceptable to have down time."
good,being in stock was a very routine day. 6:30 am to 3pm. usually Monday through Friday. i learned a lot about time management and putting a time cap on every project i did or to would delegate to my staff. the culture was very down to earth but the biggest downfall was the communication between staff and management. lack of incentives and lack of flexibility for people that were in school our had a second job.
good,"Great people, you learn a lot about the company, stuff that you would have never known about jeans! You become one with the company and just crave more of the knowledge"
good,Learned about the ins and outs of jean history and the company history. the company is very much so about their public image and history. it was a lot of fun qorking there and the managers were polite
good,"fast paced mall environment. Experiences high volume customer attention on weekends but slow paced environment during weekdays. Decent pay, chance to build with company."
good,This is not a difficult company to work for if you are self-motivating and driven. A competitive but cooperative mindset is necessary to be successful at this business.
good,"If you can't sell a woman with three kids a pair of 90 dollar jeans, three 30 dollar t-shirts, a 90 dollar dress, plus a 120 dollar customized jacket, do not work here! The store is expected to meet certain sales quotas."
good,"They will not hire you on at your 60 probation period unless you can work at 100% or better, that is very hard to do! I am a fast learner and a fast pace worker but they want you to be flawless at everything and that is very hard to do when you have so many different types of orders and different work to be done to each order they time you at every order and you can't go over that time limit or your numbers don't come to 100%. Some orders they give enough time for then others not enough and if you don't have 100% every week, then they won't hire you on"
good,"The company expects sales associates, or ""stylists"", to know a lot of information about the history of the company as well as product facts. This helps drive sales and allows for stylists to be more passionate about what they are selling and the brand they're representing."
good,A typical day at work can be rather busy or very slow. Busy days are usually the harder ones due to the sheer amount of people that will ask questions or ask for help. I've learned mainly the history of Levi's as a brand and many different ways to fold clothes. The management at Levi's is rather social and nice. They try not to push new hire out on their own and are open to answer almost any question you have. They also have a wealth of knowledge that each manager loves to share. They take the time to get to know you in both a professional sense and friendly sense. The hardest part of the job is when it does get super packed. Its honestly the hardest because some store set-ups make it extremely easy to steal while you are distracted. The most enjoyable part of the job has to be the people. The managers are very fun and social and don't just hound you to do your job. They will actually sit and talk with you about life if it is a slow going time or day.
good,"A good place to work,  very diverse, along with good lunch breaks. The only downfall is the pressure often put on employee's to meet a specific sales goal."
good,très bonne entreprise avec une équipe qui possède un esprit d'équipe que je n'avais pas encore vue auparavant très solide et pas refermer à apprendre a ses nouveaux collègue leur savoir.
good,"I only worked here for a short time while I was in high school, but the management was really cool, providing a fun place to work while still keeping on task."
good,Manager at the time was too interested in themselves. Co-workers became good friends. Not many hours of work given out. Loved working with costumers.
good,Levis Strauss is overall an okay place to work at. Co workers are great and easy to get along with. Management isn't the worst but could do better. A typical day would consist of maintaining the sales floor while assisting customers.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is you love what you do.To achieve your goals with a good workplace and a good Company. For me as an Sales Personnel, giving the best costumer service is my priority and with that my costumer will back at our store.To be able to work and contribute to the development of my company is an honor. So I will push myself to Overcome my skills."
good,"Levi's is a great work environment. It was retail, but at least I felt like I was part of the brand. The Levi's brand is an awesome brand. I felt more dedicated to my job because they treated us well and our products are the best."
good,bonne entreprise dans laquelle j'ai pu faire évoluer ma carrière avec des collaborateurs possédant une conscience professionnelle hors du commun.
good,"At the beginning its like every other job, complicated but later you get to learn the models, the colors, the codes and after that it gets fun."

Managed store operations with key-holding responsibility. Observe and encourage associates in sales floor techniques and management skills. Performed monthly reconciliation processed billing adjustments and resolve a discrepancies. Hold accountability for cashier area, credit card transacions and daily bank deposits/verifications."
good,"Levi Strauss was a good company to work for when I was first hired by them.  When the company hired a new CEO, then the company started having issues.  When the new CEO and The board of derectors  started negotiating a new contract with the Union, then the company started having issues.  The new CEO wanted to put in a new maximum pay rate to $9.50 for all new hires, and the people that had been there for more that 2 years pay would be frozen for 2 years."
good,People from all walks of life coming together to advance the agenda of the world's biggest denim company.  The company has gone through multiple restructurings over the past few years - the workforce that remains has proven to be resilient.  Excited to see if the momentum from the last two years can continue and return this company to greatness.
good,"I loved working for Levi's.  Learned a lot and made many, many life long friends.  Enjoyed working for Levi's.  Great Company to work but it's time to move on."
good,"With this being my first job in retail, Everything was new and exciting  from hanging clothes to locking up the shop. I started from the bottom and worked my way up to knowing nearly everything in that store. The management team was always changing so i developed an appreciation for all the different types of management styles there is. I still believe firm but fair is the best style. What i enjoyed the most about this company was the free uniform benefits I could represent the company and show off styles that customers would want to copy."
good,"Update everyday monitoring of work scheduled"
good,"Company has a difficult time adjusting to change. Management worked closely with employees to ensure efficiency."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of folding jeans, making the store presentable, get my daily sales goal from the manager and grab a walkie talkie. From working at Levi's I learned how to interact and assist customers. To me customer was always right no matter what. Managers were really helpful. They guided and helped me with my work related problems. There was nothing hard about this job, and the most enjoyable part of this job was interacting with new people on a daily basis."
good,um dia de separação abençoado eu so tinha amigos la naum tiha parte difícil agora a parte boa era depois do almoço nois se reunia e jogava uma partida de truco
good,"It being my first retail job (but not first job regarding customer service), I can definitely say that they teach you the basics of how to do sales and how to handle customer service pretty well! I worked as a 'Stylist' at the Flagship Store on Market in San Francisco, and since there were an abundance of tourists from all over the world, it definitely challenges you and gives you a variety of people to converse with! "
good,"Good Place to work and company has Good values."
good,A typical day at work is very mellow and managers are always on the floor checking for all merchandise that is set on the floor. Co workers are very hard working and interactive with customers. The hardest part of the job would definitely be rearranging the shelves the most enjoyable would be meeting new people from around the world and being able to tell them more about the city we live in.
good,"	Coordinate inventory control, receiving; merchandising (plan-o-grams) and store maintenance."
good,"At Levi's you are either on the register, floor, or fitting room. Register you ring customers out, bag, and deactivate the security tags. On the floor the walls and fixtures need to be stocked from the back room. Also customers need help finding products. In the fitting room customers need to be directed to an open room. Another responsibility is to fold all the unwanted clothes."
good,"Most of the day was spent selling on the sales floor and fitting customers. I learned a lot about retail here. How to manage money, open and close the store, count out the registers, and even floor planning and merchandising. If management saw potential in you they would offer you a higher position. Co-workers were fun to be around and always kept the workplace fun and interesting. Hardest part of this job was keeping up with the fast pace environment, but if you could hack it then you were on easy street. The most enjoyable part of working here was the amount of hours they provided."
good,"Highly oriented on processes, Lets you learn things independently, gives you own space, highly result oriented."
good,"Too many challenges to deal with. Multinational procedures to follow. Stretched working hours due to conference calls. Stick to the rules. Feel safe working in Levis, very important to have such values and culture"

good,I loved working at Levis.  I had fairly quick advancement early in my career and a flexible schedule.  I worked on a cross functional team which I enjoyed.
good,While working at Levis one can get to know how the clothing company work in terms for distribution. You will get to know how the company handle every clients.
good,"Scanning items and keeping them in the same order. Can do this all day and I had to at one time we'll, the night shift worked from my knowledge45 days straight it was to much for some but , that was a challenge to me"
good,"Si quieres una excelente compensación, Levi Strauss tiene un lugar para ti. Existe poca rotación debido a que el talento se desarrolla internamente."
good,Everyone was always inviting and very knowledgeable about the products being sold. It was easy to make friends with your coworkers and managers which made it fun. They also focused a lot on making the customers satisfied and ensuring professionalism.
good,Levis is a well known brand with a high quality product. Great job culture and great benefits. Levis invests in their employees. The hardest part of this job is lifting stacks of jeans. the most enjoyable is when you help a customer find the perfect jeans.
good,"Support Store Management team and assist with deliveries and organization of stock room"
good,"Levi’s was a great seasonal job, the managers that were there when I was working were very kind and helpful. They were very flexible and easy to work with. The employees there always have tips and helped out as much as they could."
good,Levi Strauss was a great company to work for before they took their factories to Mexico. They offered great medical insurance. They offered profit sharing. They offered opportunity to advance.
good,"Levis does several things incorrectly, but they make up for it with what they do get right. Their training program is multi-tiered, fast-paced, and rewarding: they really teach you a lot about the company and the product. They also have several employee incentive programs. On top of the occasional competition or contest, whenever a store reaches their monthly sales goal, every employee is allowed one free item up to $100 in value. Their employee discount is unimpressive, but I believe this makes up for it. Remember that training program I mentioned? When you complete ever aspect, you get to choose another free item up to $100. "
good,"Feels like a company that has been in transition for a very long time. It has too many opportunities and not enough unity of goals.The brand is incredibly valuable yet, there isn't enough vision to do enough with it."
good,Do well and youll be rewarded. Work hard. Denim was life. I was taught everything i need to know. I learn to love the culture and why it  is so great.
good,apredi como lhe dar com as pessoas e seus interesses
good,"La valoracion y la confianza que depositan en el trabajador,la iniciativa de darnos cursos habitualmente eran muy buenos,"

good,"Levi's is great first retail job they will teach you the ins & out of retail, how to be successful in the field & give you great job habits that will push your advancement elsewhere. However climbing the ladder within the company can be difficult."
good,"The company seems like it values it employees. My managers were really nice and understanding. The way they do scheduling is frustrating because they do ""call-ins,"" so a day off isn't really a day off when you might have to go in."
good,"The environment is very relaxed and the management and other staff are very friendly and helpful."
good,Stocking and cashiers were the main daily jobs of the day. Work was easy and no heavy lifting was required. Teamwork was possible when there was enough staff.
good,I was just entering the corporate world and Levi Strauss and Co. was a fantastic company to work for. The opportunities were unlimited and available. A great company that I would definitely consider working for in the near future.
good,Management at Levis and company were either great or awful. The workplace culture was always amazing.  Corporate always wanted us to be able to express yourself freely.
good,"its a good place to work when your trying to balance school but as a full-time job its not anything special. the pay could be a lot better, and some benefits should be provided. don't get me wrong its a great place for a high schooler but only for a high schooler or college student looking to make a little extra money."
good,having to work with levi and strauss is a opportunity for people looking to have stable income with benefits  and you learn different jobs in work from many co-workers
good,Each day is similar yet can have something pop up at any time that will be a busy and complex issue.  You never know what will happen.  Good team environment and helpful to give work and life balance.
good,"diverse, enjoyed all the different types of employees and customers."
good,"Levi Strauss is a great company to work for. They are very involved with community service and giving back. The company rewards its employees for the good work that they do."
good,"There are only a few global retailers which empowers their employees, however in saying that the opportunities for growth are limited given the size of the organization."
good,"I worked here as a seasonal employee last year and was kept on as a permanent sales associate. I enjoyed all of the things I learned, the people I got to meet, and the overall time I spent there. Customer satisfaction was put first, which is something that I believe in, so challenging myself to help meet every need of the customer was something I still value today."
good,This company allows you to fully be yourself as long as the job is being completed. Was able to grow within the company. Customer service is stressed very very much.
good,a typical day at work is like just coming in on time doing what you have to do and go home. im friendly but i dont wanna make no new friends. its not a hardest part but the best part is going home and seeing the customers  happy.
good,"I only got to work here a month because I had to relocate but while I worked there a lot of people quit. I worked as a packer and it worsened my back problems because i had to stand in one spot folding and packing clothes all day. Right before I left the summer hours were poopy, you had to work mon-sat sometimes even sunday and we went from working 3:30-2 am on second shift to 3:30- 3 am everyday mandatory overtime."
good,"Friendly work atmosphere and allow for work life balance.  You get a full filled day working to deliver the best customer and consumer experience whether it is from a product point of view, being in stock at store level or delivering a compelling marketing message."
good,Management team is friendly and great to work with. Job Training was very helpful in learning about the different jeans and how to help customers.
good,"Organización del producto, atención al cliente y asesor de moda."
good,"Once you clock in for your shift, you will get chatted in on what is expected for that day. You make sure to help every consumer that walks in and help them with whatever they need. The team at Levis is amazing and i have learned so much in the two years that I've worked there. The hardest part of this job is getting used to working in every department, which will happen so be prepared to work in different areas. However, they do a great job of training you in every area, so as long as your a hard-worker and are prepared to learn, you'll be fine!"
good,Fun place to work but too many major changes within company caused uneasiness and lack of job security.  Loved the culture and the company's commitment to the community.  Advancement withing the company was not readily available.
good,A fun place to work while gaining experience. There was always something to do. There is room to grow always and having patience is the main key to  it all.
good,"Best part of working at Levis "
good,I really enjoy working in a fast paced retail environment which is exactly what this is. A typical work day goes very smoothly with no issues. I learned how to manage workers and how to be a productive leader. I really enjoy helping my employees to learn how excel in their work environment and how to provide good customer service to all customers.
good,"good"
good,"A Typical work day included: finding the right pair of pants for people, and mainly being a cashier. The management was very nice, helpful, and made sure everything was being done correctly. The employees all got along, so it made the workplace more desirable. The most enjoyable part was seeing all the different cultures coming in, because we were right next to the casino and had a variety of people come through the store."
good,"El problema de la empresa en ese momento es que pasaban por una crisis, la empresa era una franquicia y el dueño de esta, tenia problemas financieros, a lo que la tienda sufría por la falta de mercancía, y algunos clientes se molestaban por que no teníamos en existencia novedades,"
good,"Coworkers were easy to get along with. Management was mostly relaxed but were strict and stern when needed. There's something oddly relaxing about folding jeans for hours on end, not sure how to describe it. I would recommend this job trying to earn a few bucks for spending, but if you have responsibilities and bills to pay - look somewhere else."
good,"While on the clock, managers and peers were very helpful in assisting me with the upbeat environment of the store. Levis Clothing Co. gave the perfect environment to polish customer service skills and conflict management."
good,"It’s their values: empathy, originality, integrity and courage. These guide every decision they make and every action they take. And they fuel our commitment to drive profits through principles."
good,"It is very laid back, Pay is not competitive. Very interactive work enviorment"

good,They were very welcoming and like a big family! The perks of shopping while on break were good too.
good,It was a great experience for me to work at a levis store as a fresher
good,"Working stock I'd go in for 5-6am, open a bunch of boxes of jeans and clothes, sort them out and put them out on the floor. "
good,"•	Consistently achieved and exceeded sales targets"

good,Very forward looking and nice work areas within the workplace. Managers were honest and professional.
good,"La giornata tipo si svolgeva con la vendità diretta al pubblico della merce. Delle volte veniva risistemato il magazzino e quando arrivavano i pancali, quest'ultimi venivo sbollati e contati tutti i pezzi presenti all'interno dei colli.La merce arrivata veniva risistemata accuratamente all'interno del magazzino."
good,fitting women for the new curve i.d. system Levi's has
good,"I looked forward to going to work everyday, I built long lasting friendships with my coworkers and managers that i still communicate with today. I spoke with many different tourists and was able to understand their wants. There was no hard part of the job, i enjoyed every moment there, to me it was like a second home. I Learned a lot working here."
good,"Levis é uma loja antiga onde foi a marca referente do jeans, com toda uma história referente ao mesmo."
good,Los días eran de trabajo constante y la atención al cliente personalizada.
good,"A day at work would be fun. All my coworkers were energetic, great attitudes, and positive examples on how to handle foreign customers. I learned patience, certain words in different languages to assist the foreign shoppers, and product knowledge. The hardest part of the job was getting people to sign up for the levi website. The rest was pretty simple I must say."
good,"•To sell Levi’s and Dockers irregulars and closeouts, while offering customer’s value, selection and superior service."
good,Unfortunately company continues to struggle due to bad management choices early on. You can't get much more history than Levi Strauss & Co
good,Before my joining time this store will be closed for poor business but when i join this store the company belive that our good afort give us to batter business & we done.
good,Working at levis improved my communication skills and was a good learning experience for one of my first jobs. Levis is a consumer priority environment so i learned how to really connect and sell product to any and all consumers
good,"Buena empresa para trabajar, prestaciones de ley, un buen ambiente de trabajo"
good,out of the jobs that i have had great work place. it was a vary welcoming place from the managers to the other employs.it was a great experience an i am glad that i had a chance to be apart of it.
good,"Where I worked it was always fun. My managers were great and the overall energy was just good. No stress when working at Levi's. Plus they have the best jeans, I literally never wear anything else lollll!"
good,"LS &CO is a good company. I like our CEO, Chip, since he really cares about his employees and community where we live. "
good,"Ambiente laboral complicado, conflictos y mala organización por parte de la agencia que contrara"
good,It was a fun place to work at and the coworkers made it even more comfortable and excited to work there. I wish I was able to stay but unfortunately I had to move.
good,"Tiene un ambiente favorable, a nivel equipo. Se aprende mucho y se puede trabajar en diferentes areas ya que se logra una confianza en tu labor"
good,Pretty laid back atmosphere and the managers are nice enough people. Typical retail job where you are expected to help the store meet certain sales quotas.
good,Worked there after my senior year of high school for the summer and it was pretty solid. Good management and all the other employees were  nice. Would recommend.
good,"This is a perfect job for anyone who is seeking a first time job, it is retail so you do have to deal with customer everyday but you do have a lot of fun and it is a pretty cool company to work for short term."
good,"During a typical day, I would go in, grab my walk and see what my position was for the day and see my schedule. I learned social skills, problem solving skills. The management was great, some managers were more understanding than others. Hardest part was when there was little work to do, making your time feel wasted."
good,"The Levi's brand is definitely an interesting and fun store to work for especially if you are passionate about the brand itself. No complaints with the execution of training or business practices of all Levi's stores. Only had a problem with management at my last location due to favouritism among staff and the last minute calls to come in and work when you were not scheduled to. Hours were pretty decent, and you were able to move from the sales floor to cash to stock room upon request and preference."
good,"Service has to be of the highest degree, ensuring customers walk away happy, restocking the shelves and tidying up are always going to be an aspect in this work. Learned cashing up at the end of the night, sorting through delivery and stockroom management, and the effective ways to engage with customers. To start management was good and things were kept tight but as time has progressed and two new supervisors have come in, the management of the store has gone downhill. Hardest part of the job is managing multiple customers at one time all needing different things at the same time always kept on your toes. Best part is seeing customers walk away happy with your help."
good,A fun place to work at. Customers may be difficult cause majority of the consumers do not speak english or very little. Other than that the company isnt the worst place to work for.
good,Inclusive environment with programs that encourage volunteering and employee fitness.   Nice benefits that are above average.  Get work with people from all over the world.
good,Hours are flexible. You just have to let them know before-hand. Fun to get along with your co-workers. It is fast paced because you have quotas to meet. 10 minute breaks.
good,"Pioneer and inventor of the first blue jean. Levi's is the market leader within denim and apparel. "
good,Top toujours a donner des conseils pour progresser
good,"I started in the company as a first level manager, working in several departments along side other managers, employees non union and union members. Hardest part of the job is the  environment can be stressful during peak seasons because of production standards and in non peak seasons it is stressful because of pettiness between workers and managers with lack of skills to work well together. The most enjoyable part of the environment would be 4 work day weeks at 10 hours, good benefits, company would have a couple of cook outs in the year, some good perks along the way in the year like $5 jean sales, free ice cream treats, small gifts of lanyards, awards, and days of Halloween dress up, silly sock days etc to improve moral."
good,"This store gives better service than most other stores at the outlets. It's definitely a fast-paced, on your toes environment. Feedback is given regularly, which may be hard for some to hear, but I guess it's better than not knowing how you're doing...  The schedule does change a lot which can be annoying, but they try to let you know as soon as possible and some of it has to do with shipment, so I don't think they can really do much about that. At the same time, they're also pretty flexible for request offs. "
good,Levis was a fun culture to work in.  It seemed like we always learned something new about the products.  While working at Levis i learned to balance sales and management functions.
good,"Levi's Strauss is a company running since the 1900's, so it is important to hire people willing to put everything out there for their brand. "
good,"Overall, the company is a very good ideal one. The core values are great, but they don't always translate to management. I've learned a lot and had many opportunities to learn and grow within the company."
good,"Muy buen lugar de trabajo, atención constante con clientes, tareas diarias muy amenas, acompañadas de compañeros de trabajo y jefes."
good,I learned alot. It was great place to work. They really cared about you and your success within the company. They anted you to win and to move forward
good,"To elaborate on the dress code, Levi's requires its employees to wear Levi's merchandise or clothing with no visible logos or text. A clothing allowance was provided, however"
good,"Realmente es muy buen trabajo en cuanto a el salario. Lo malo es que son bastantes horas parado y estas muy vigilado por todo mundo y te sientes incomodo, ya que no puedes moverte un segundo porque ya te andan buscando"
good,"My overall experience was nice, the staff was friendly and the objectives were easy and fun. Your job would remain the same each day unless there was a big rush that required more associates to be on the sales floor. The amount of breaks and duration was fair. As for dress code, Levi's material is enforced."
good,It was a pretty good part time job was still going to high school at this time so was there when i was off from school and high school related activates . Managers were very understanding and very helpful .
good,"en una tienda levis es necesario tener todo en orden y legible para que el cliente lo pueda encontrar y tu tampoco se te dificulte aprendi que cada complexion necesita algo diferente y se basa en tallas y gustos."
good,"Helping consumers find fits they like, helped restock inventory. Helped out with cash wrap and any other tasks on the floor."
good,"Levi's was a fun company to work for! Since it is corporate there is a lot of opportunity to advance in the company. With that being said, it was more strict and protocol & policies must be followed according to the handbook. The company has a lot of history under it's belt as well. Weekends were the busiest but on a daily basis, the selling goals given were calculated and determined fairly based on traffic.

good,"Working at Levi's was a great experience as my first time job. I learned how to cooperate with others while remaining calm, patient, and professional."
good,Job was not hard. Worked Forklift most of the day. When warehouse was slow was moved to other departments to assist. Such as flex pack and order picking.
good,i working here to practice myself to be more creative and practical to fashion design by following the modern design and also make my personality to be more fashionista.
good,I typical work day is honestly fast. Times flies when working with consumers. I learned so much about people I can look at person and know what sized jean they are. They taught me the basic social skill of being nice and helpful which will take me a long way in a workplace. Nothings really hard about working in retail when you enjoy helping people find clothes. The most enjoyable part about working at Levi's is that they give back to their employees. It's many ways to achieve company goals and when we do we get rewards like free items.
good,I worked at an outlet location.  It was constantly busy and had the environment for the most part was fun.  The stores are great to work for especially when starting in retail.  You will learn a lot  that can help you grow and advance your career in retail management and beyond.  The company culture was good.

good,I worked grave yard shifts so I listened to my music as I stocked and cleaned the store prior to opening. The management time was very nice and they congratulated me when I left the job for a college scholarship.
good,"I was only a seasonal support, however, with my short time working at Levi's, it was enjoyable. Most days are very relaxed, so you'll be organizing the store. Every now and then, whether it be holidays or a sale in general, there's a rush, but communication with your coworkers and managers is key which was handled very well. The location I worked was very small which made it much less stressful as there's less area to cover when it comes to cleaning, checking on customers and loss prevention. They teach you product knowledge and let you try them on so you have a personal opinion when asked by customers. Overall, my experience with Levi's was great."
good,i learned the importance of acknowledging different cultures there by assisting different customers accordingly. there was a good effective management with great feedback and follow ups and constantly changing to adopt to market trend. at times language was a barrier when i face a deep Arabic customer.
good,A good place to learnt new things challing for someone who wants to grow better in retail as lot of depth is there in learning in levis their standards display work everything is nice

good,"Being in the jungle of New York City, so many new and different customers came to get clothing opinions and new styles that meet their everyday lives. Assisting customers with sizing and making their shopping experience an enjoyable one. The most enjoyable part was being an extensive part of someones day."
good,Enjoyed working there.  I got along with employees and management. I liked working first shift. I worked in sorter dept. sent jeans to flex pac to package to send to stores
good,"I was a seasonal employee here and it was a good time with fun and interesting experiences. The managers at the time were cool, my co-workers were fun. It kinda sucked getting laid off because this was my first real job."
good,Levi's has been around for ages and it's ever-lasting appeal has been able to make it through the changing trends. Very fun when I was starting my career with youthful energy.

good,"Enter building and ensure it is business ready, receive that days shipment,un-package and place merchandise in the proper place."
good,I thought it was a good place to work.  The atmosphere is always positive and the staff are great.  The store also looks incredible.
good,"I was pushed as a visual merchandiser to meet certain expectations. I enjoyed it but it was extremely intimidating even with my previous years of experience. It was an awesome company to work for, its a shame that location closed"
good,"A fun work place with a consistent work environment.Good team work, with good working conditions, and the best part is driving different forklifts."
good,"Depending on which kind of Levis you work at your experience could be vary different."
good,"Empresa com bom porte de trabalho, bons benefícios, carga horária um pouco puxada, gerencia e administração boa e com grandes oportunidades de crescimento."
good,"I usually go into work, about 10-15 minutes before my schedule and then I clock in and do a 5 minute chat-in and begin working on either the sales floor or register. I make sure I help customers even the ones with big purchases and then once the day is done I clock out and go home. Depending on how many hours i work depends how long the break is."
good,the workplace was really good. people were nice and the manager was really good and used treat people in a proper way and the environment was very friendly and warm.
good,Great management and fun environment to work at. It's an easy job to learn and be good at. All you need is good customer service.
good,"At this employer, the culture was amazing. I never disliked coming to work. However, the paycheck is what i wished was a little bit more. At the end of the day, bills need to be paid and the amazing culture was wonderful but that doesn't pay the bills."
good,"I began with this company almost 20 years ago as a Production Control Analyst and have worked my way up to System Administrator and Tripwire Support Trainee.  I was the only Scheduler for all of Levi Strauss Globally and helped initiate many new applications/servers/software etc over my years here.  I have worked with some awesome people over these years near and afar and will miss them deeply.  After this many years together it's like a big family."
good,In pakweg tien jaar bij Levi's Stores heb ik zo'n beetje alles meegemaakt in positief en ook wel negatief opzicht. Dat maakte het een zeer leerzame en bijzondere werkervaring op allerlei gebied. Vele ups en downs samen met het bedrijf en mijn collega's meegemaakt. Achteraf gezien kijk ik vooral met heel veel plezier terug op de samenwerking en sfeer die er heerste.
good,"workers work hard all day but also have time to have fun, talk with each other, and take a break. I learned how to work with others and be able to communicate and solve problems I come across. the management listens to the problems and needs of the employees and solves them in a timely manner. most co-workers are easy to get along with and are hardworking. the hardest part of the job is when employees have conflicts regarding the distribution of the job and the long hours of standing. the most enjoyable part of the job is being able to learn how to operate machines that are new to me and working with people who share the same interest."
good,"A typical day at Levis would be helping customers find what they are looking for, offering valuable suggestions based on acquired retail knowledge, and keeping the store in shape in the process. "
good,"Receptionist (@Cherry Street location), of a 28 line, 500 extension switchboard. Enjoyed my job, and management. Plant Closure."
good,"Ha sido unas de mis mejores experiencias laborales desde los 16 años que llevo trabajando. Tenía un equipazo, desde el encargado hasta los compañeros que menos horas realizaban a la semana. Mis coordinadores son unos profesionales de los pies a la cabeza, con una formación excelente y con las ideas y propósitos muy claros (al igual que mi encargada/o)"
good,"was a early morning shift, perfect managing skills, experienced all types of fork-lift machinery and meet a lot of good coworkers that actually talk to till this day"
good,"Goede werkgever, flexibel en open. Goede zorg voor personeel, regelmatig training en team activiteiten behoren tot de mogelijkheden."
good,"I have no complains for this company, just the payroll structure was really tough."
good,"É uma empresa que esta propensa a opiniões do colaboradores, para que possa contribuir no bom funcionamento e ajude tando no desenvolvimento da empresa quanto dos funcionários."
good,Lots of hard work and sales targets to be met ensuring you are providing the best customer service and ensure all customers are happy. If there is something we don't have in store we can orderthem in for them.
good,"•	Doughnuts producing: hand making, fried, and shower sugar. Production line support"
good,I would report to work at 7am Mondays thru Friday and bring in shipment. I was the lead merchant. I would bring in all the product.  I would sensor all product and place them in the correct area.
good,"A day at work during monday to  wensday we often quiet in terms of sales and the traffic of our customers is less. and what i learned u treat yo job as if it was your own company , treat all customers the same , with our manangement would say its not bad or good just average , co-wokers would say we are a happy firmely . the hardest part off the job is on weekends where u get customers comming in the store as swamp of bees helping six to eight customers at once . as well when we have to do stock take that has to be done in two days"
good,"its nice to work there when i first came to the US , after a while i felt that i can do more because of my education and skills , "
good,"The culture is very accepting and the people are one of a kind. It's retail, so the job comes with specific demands of your life- as to be expected. Lots of room for internal promotion and development if you are willing to put in the work. A great retail experience."
good,Good company and co-workers but too many management changes. Was not willing to work with my second job schedule.
good,"Busy environment everyday, challenges you to your highest potential."
good,"ottimo ambiente lavorativo, buon rapporto con colleghi, attività stimolanti e gratificanti."
good,was very cultural and productive being a team member with the sorter induction unit
good,Frankly I found Levi's strauss to be an awesome place to work.
good,"Levi's was a nice experience, dealt with heavy accented people due to working in a tourist mall. Learned to keep the store organized and how to communicate and upgrade sales. The most enjoyable part was meeting new co-workers everyday because everyone worked different shifts."
good,"This company is always busy its located in the outlets where alot of tour buses come, we get flows and flows of people. It's a great company to work for i learned alot about the company."
good,Stock shelves and helping customers find items wan fun.I liked my co-workers very much.
good,"A typical day at Levi's is a little basic, you're folding clothes all day (either on the floor, back of the house or at the cashier registers). But you also have the pleasure of meeting all different cultures (asians, africans, europeans, everyone!)"
good,"Good place to work, but some times like any other warehouse you will be working some long hours and maybe 5 to 6 days a week. The break time are good as well. No issues with security. Mostly it's a laid back place to work. They also every shift take about 15 minutes to stretch before  you begin your day"
good,"Levi is a great first time retail job. The environment is very friendly , managers get down to everything that needs to be known. Once you get the hang of things the job is fairly easy."
good,"Levi's is a fun place to work at with friendly coworkers. It is a very fast paced environment, but enjoyable at the same time. It is definitely a job where you learn to interact with different types of customers and grow comfortable with approaching them. The only bad thing was getting hours and their lack of advising when your time is up."
good,"At Levi's, the workplace was very busy and that is what I enjoyed the most about it and helping customers in finding the jeans of their preference was satisfying seeing the look in their face when they were satisfied with your service."
good,"en las instalaciones se tiene un muy buen ambiente laboral, trabajo en grupo, apoyo laboral y tiene excelentes capacitaciones y asesorias para la mejora y enriquecimiento entorno a lo laboral"
good,The people here do their work and are helpful to beginners. The pay and benefits such as free food after a successful quarter are good. The bad is that they fail to tell employees with transparency about their employment status as seasonal.
good,It was nice flow of what was happening and what was going to happen while working there because it was pretty simple not much experience was really needed except for some social skills for the job that I did anyway.
good,"Levis has still to this date been the staple of american culture. They are innovative, face paced, and fun to work for. With constant ideas flowing throughout the company Levis stayed ahead of the curve and pushed for business accountability and change."
good,"Management and co-workers and flexibility were the best things about this position.  It was stressful and crazy at times, but always learning, and enjoyable for the most part."
good,"A typical day of work at Levi's consisted of a brief chat with a manager about previous day sales, current sales, and sale goals for both the current day and the entire week/month. It then lead to a short and sweet conversation about where the merchandise has moved, current sales going on, etc.. After that I would be assigned a department of the store, for example, Dressing Rooms, Cash Register, Women's, or Men's, which is where i would stay until told otherwise. Working at Levi's I learned a lot about clothing retail itself, how to fold clothes properly, how to run fitting rooms, and how often the sales really do change. Working at Levi's was one of the best experiences of my life. Everyone was so friendly, the culture was so diverse, and everyone got along. The hardest part about working at Levi's was learning about all the different types of jeans, corresponding the style number with the style, and realizing that the merchandise is constantly being rearranged,"
good,"When working, the managers and supervisors try and make the work environment enjoyable for everyone.  They are also understanding and are willing to work out any situation to the best of their abilities. And work doesn't always feel like work because everyone around you actually enjoys being there."
good,"Ottimo ambiente, managers molto preparati, contesto molto Internazionale."
good,Requirements placed for the project had lot of requirement gaps. Process is not followed.More time has to  be spent on the Business and the development process. but great team coordination was there.
good,"I absolutely love the company and what it stands for. Levi's is a great, socially responsible company which is truly awesome to see. The work environment and culture is tremendous."
good,Great community and team to be a part of. Weekends tend to be more busy than weekdays. Coworkers are always willing to help you succeed and managers are willing to assist.
good,The best company that I ever worked for. The company was really concerned and cared about its employees. There were opportunities to grow within the organization.
good,"Great company to work for! Great culture, great people and great balance of having fun while succeeding at your job! As long as you work hard and put in your time, you will succeed!"
good,Es un buen lugar para trabajar ya que sé preocupa la empresa por el personal
good,"Empresa onde o vendedor amplia suas próprias habilidades no atendimento ao cliente, tanto no ato de venda quanto no de pós-venda. Empresa que oferece interessantes premiações anualmente e estimula o esforço tanto individual quanto coletivo para uma aquisição salarial cada vez melhor."
good,"only thing that sucks is management they need better supervisors and coordinators, pay is ok environment is great you will love the work not the management..."
good,"Good company good discount, and worked well with my school schedule. Managers were willing to teach and help grow in your current position. Managers tend to get hired from within with some exceptions."
good,Levis var en rolig fartfylld arbetsplats med ett stort flow av människor. De lade ner mycket resurser på att lära mig sälja och att arbeta med logistisk och försäljningssiffror. Ledningen hade god insikt i arbetet i butiken och följde regelbundet upp med sin personal för att försäkra sig om att de både trivdes och utvecklades.
good,They take care of you here and they help you get to where you want in the warehouse good trainers and supervisors they give you hours when you need them too
good,"Buen ambiente laboral, trabajo en equipo, desarrollo en ventas muy bueno"
good,Loved working there and helping the customers. Most enjoyable was helping the customer pick out the correct jeans that fitted them well. Which really made my day
good,"great day, learned how to deal with different personalities management was great a lot of different ethnicity hardest about the job is the competition have to be quick on your toes want i most enjoy about the job is conversations"
good,"As I worked for Levi's over 15 years ago, and they have gone through numerous changes since then, I don't believe I am in a position to provide meaningful feedback."
good,"Levi Strauss is a company that probably over communicates, which is definitely better than the alternative since communication is key to business.  With retail being highly connected to detail, this is a definite strength for the company."
good,Successfully helped customers find desired looks and styles. Fast paced environment. Efficiently made sales. Earned bonuses (clothing). Met and inspired people that were interested in learning about the brand.
good,"Levi's at the Philadelphia Premium Outlets is a well-run business, one of the best in the outlets, management does a great job creating opportunities for its workers and customers.Language barriers are tough between many customers, but interaction with different cultures is fun."
good,Una gran empresa para trabajar y poder aprender muchísimo sobre ellos
good,"Great company to work for, the environment is great with a lot of coworkers getting to know each other. It worked well with my schedule when I went to college."
good,Levi's is the best place to start off as your first job. Great coworkers and a great experience for a job. Very flexible hours and outstanding performance.
good,"Levi's es un buen lugar de trabajo, que se preocupa por sus empleados y por sus clientes."
good,The environment here is bearable. The main issue with this company is the sheer volume of meetings. They are a process driven company vs. a sales driven company.
good,"Eager to teach and accept new workers, there was a great community between all of the employees. Any changes were communicated and taught both in a group and individually"
good,It's easy to develop a certain distaste for retail. I think personally it's where you start. Levi's for me was a great place to start because it's so community based and had a easy game plan to follow. That's usually found in places with high moral and a winning mentality. Great place to start.
good,"Fun work place, very fast paced, lots of foreigners visit. Typical day is getting customer the right fit of jeans and informing them of new merchandise."
good,"Levi's can be a really great place to work, depending on your personality. You must be confident, in order to successfully approach every customer, and there is definitly a defining personality to most employees. With three managers in less than a year, it has been a struggle, but the current manager is great. "
good,"Still in progress here, but has been a very challenging and benefical job all at the same time.  It takes passionate people to work here, but the management and staff make that positivity easy to maintain."
good,"Levi's has gone thru some hard times, so there are plenty of challenges and some demanding hours.  This is a natural mix for stress and fatigue, especially if you are a person who takes ownership of situations to get them resolved."
good,"work environment was too good.I like the place.And colleges was very friendly.Typical Day at work was busy."
good,constantly busy being part of the stock team. a lot of heavy lifting. barely any interaction with customers due to I'm always in the back room. but i would like more hours
good,"Aprendí a ser unidos y trabajar en conjunto, no quitarnos a los clientes. Buena enseñanza de todo lo que era referente al trabajo."
good,"Levis possède véritablement une culture d entreprise, avec un fonctionnement très rigoureux. L'échange avec le siège est constant (formations, challenge, opérations promotionelles, conférences téléphoniques..)"
good,"This distribution center is a 24 hour, 7 days a week operation, lots of overtime and call in work. I received 20 years of automation maintenance education. Maintenance management was understanding due constant equipment operation. This was a union plant and the rules were set.That being said was relaxed for the employees. Emergency equipment repair was the hardest part, but that was tolerable.I enjoyed being able to purchase discounted Levi garments and the special occasion dinners."
good,"On the weekends, I would begin work at 6:30am doing stock and refolding the walls. On the weekdays I would be on the sales floor usually. I learned how to stock and take inventory as well as sell apparel and help customers pick the best fit. The management and culture were wonderful The most enjoyable part of the job was being surround by friendly and non-judgmental people; similar to myself. The hardest part of the job was getting up at 5:30, but it was the most ideal shift."
good,Levis is a very upbeat job. its hardly ever slow and even when it is slow it is still rather fun. I seriously think of my coworkers as family. This job is awesome!! will definitely recommend to others.
good,"Levi's was my first job. It was a great experience for me, giving me insight into the variety of people you can meet aside from just your coworkers. It was fast-paced with a great welcome experience of trying on all of the jeans and receiving two pairs for free for becoming a new member of the team. I would highly recommend it to family or friends."
good,"Operate and maintain all automation equipment and building. I learned a great deal about automation and building maintenance. This was a central distribution center and was fast paced.While I was a technician the work was very good. While in management I learned a great deal of the business operations of the plant and managing employees. The hardest part of the job was working 7 days a week for months at a time. I really enjoyed the learning the job, either as a technician and in management."
good,"L’environnement  n’était  pas top les toilette été crade y'avais pas de casier dans la réserve  , pas de clim pas de chauffage , appart sa tout allez bien ."
good,"Durante el tiempo que preste mis servicios fueron súper entretenidos ,divertidos aprendí muchísimo ."
good,"I would stay at productive limit, putting rivets on pockets in jeans."
good,llegar antes de las nueve para poder ordenar algunas prendas que quedaron desordenadas aprender a interactuar con las personas .
good,working at Levis was okay on certain days it would be very hot in the store than really cold. I learned that not every customer is looking for help and not every customer is nice. The hardest part about working at Levis is holidays because hundreds of people come in the store looking for all the sales we were having. The most enjoyable part of the job was working early in the morning because it isn't a lot of people in the store. Managment was good they made sure every employee knew exactly what they were doing and always made sure everyone felt comfortable in their positions.
good,Assisted consumers to find products they enjoy and helped with any questions needed. Maintained the look of the store meanwhile Assist in pricing of merchandise as needed.Meet or exceed established store and individual sales and performance goals daily
good,Loved working for this company. Very good pay and benefits. The only problem was that it closed due to cheap overseas labor. Hated to see the factory close.
good,Very small organization in Philippines. Lean organization and utilized employees very well.  Benefits could be better and some policies are outdated. Lots of clothing perks.
good,Very good company. Had a great experience with the employees and management. Sometimes unorganized but for the most part very good company to work for if your field is sales.
good,Excelente ambiente de trabajo buenos compañeron en todas las areas
good,Long days with a lot of and great learning's.  A union environment that can be stressful sometimes but we always seem to work out a solution. The management has always been a hard working group who know how to get the job done.  The almost 20 years I have been here we have always been the largest Distribution facility shipping more product than the others.
good,"Great place to work, really enjoying learning from my management team who focusing on the consumer as well as your career development. Great company that cares about the internal consumer as well as the environment and making a better place."
good,"all of my jobs were great and I enjoyed them mostly were temp jobs. I will love to work for either jobs again. They all were friendly, nice pay and in area jobs."
good,Levi warehouse was just super hot in the summer and cool in the winter time. it sucks u work 12 hr shift wit 2 15 mins break and 1 30 min lunch break. long hours working here. very low pay.
good,"A typical day would begin with me letting my team know of our sales goals for the store and individually, also we would do a chant to get everyone excited about our work day make different goals for different prizes. I learned to be able to put a lot of different people to work all for one cause and team, also how to manage many different positions all at once. "
good,typical day at work is chill and smooth.....i learned to induct clothes into the system and to do customer return....management is pretty good..my co workers are fun to work with...there is nothing hard about this job...and the most enjoyable part about the job is coming in seeing everyone doing their work..
good,"They are busy and awesome to work for.. they have good discounts and free items, short breaks long hours, needs to be able to have good attitude and temper"
good,"Boa Equipa;"
good,The management of the Levi company is really motivating. Everyone is really passionate about the business and are very knowledgeable.
good,I like this job cause it gave me the chance to actually experience how to deal with customers and have patience. It helped me to understand cultures and meet new people
good,"It is hard demanding work. But a good company. Needs a bus route to it for those who do not have vehicle. There a pool table, foose ball and a store in the cafateria"
good,"Nice place to work "
good,"1. Replenishing and restocking merchandise with other stock associates."
good,"A typical work day consisted of assisting customers with purchases, stocking the floor and assisting team members with duties as assigned. I learned about customer service and the Levi Brand. My manager and coworkers were very helpful and we had an opportunity to perform community service with the company. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers and the community service,"
good,"Dìa laboral, constantemente activo."
good,"poste très agréable , tout le monde est sympa . atmosphère très cool"
good,"Great work life balance."
good,We would start off the day with a meeting. In the meeting we would find out how much product we you have to push out that night. I would have to separately talk to the supervisor to see what position would help us produce more product and she would give me my job assignment. Management was laid back and respected by employees. The co-workers were the same and was willing to work as much as possible. The hardest part of the job was not knowing what i was gonna do on a daily but it was also enjoyable because i was doing something new on a daily basis.
good,Retail is one of the worst things to work in. This place was fun when we had great people working on the floor. It could be tiring when you had customers come in and act without sense.
good,This was only a seasonal job. it was a fun place to work for the holidays. It is not meant to be a career. Just for in-between time
good,Fun and fast paced job. Always entertainment and fun atmosphere. Great owners and staff. Loved it. Only worked there to cover for a friend for a few months until she could return to work. Great place to work for.
good,So far i think that they have a good establishment i go in and work needing no supervision yet if you have any questions i can get the answers i need from my trainer.  The co-workers are friendly and so are the management staff and i do enjoy going there.  It's just a temporary job and i need a full time one with benefits.
good,It is a nice company and one of the most leading group of company in GCC. They are giving the needs of the employee if they can. My manager's are all understanding and very friendly.
good,Great huge company to work for. Potential for more growth and expansion. Additional pre training program for employees can help increase more efficiency across all departments.
good,"A typical day in the workplace included a large amount of working with customers. From this, one does learn great people skills and how to deal with all types of situations. The employees were amazing and it was like working in a big family."
good,My first job ever.  I learned alot about management and the ins and outs of sales and retail.  I loved the flexibilty and the chance to work independently
good,Most enjoyable part of job at Levi's is its fast pace of work with changing market trends every season. Requires a person to go extra mile on almost every task to make things happen. Fast paced but rewarding.
good,"Dealing with a lot of tourists, trying to help them find their sizes. At the end of the work day, cleaning up took hours. Sometimes we were there til 1 and 2 am."
good,All people around us are open minded and all have something to gain.  Always smiling co-workers and most of all helpful people.
good,"Levi's is a very busy place to work. There's always something to do and someone to help. Management was pretty cool, stern but understanding and fun. The co-workers can be a little immature, but it's all about the group you work with. Closing sucks because since the store is so big, you close at 10 but don't go home until 1am since there's so much to be folded and put away. The hardest part of the job was helping customers who didn't speak English, and getting your name across so you get the credit for the sale. All in all it's a great first job experience."
good,"Aprendi a un mejor manejo de caja, habìa mucho compañerismo y las actividades realizadas ahi eran de muho interès."
good,"I enjoyed my time spent at Levi's for the last 2 and half years. I started as a chrismas temp and through dedication I ended up doing the delivery. "
good,"I had a very enjoyable time at this company. It was contracted, so I knew I would be limited in time there. Worked with a good team that had great communication..  I would love to go back,doing the same job or maybe even more."
good,"If you like to work in retail, this is a great place to work at. I was there for almost 3 years and I enjoyed working with everyone there."
good,"Long hours, but great work environment. Afforded the opportunity to learn all areas of the warehouse."
good,Excellent management system with nice team member.I learned about supply chain management system.
good,"On a normal day at work you would come in and say hello to co-workers and managers, then clock in and began work. after this management would give you a daily assignment and you would"
good,"Always kept busy, coworkers were very friendly and cool so were the managers."
good,"Une très bonne entreprise "
good,"	Handle cash and credit sales, and close out till at the end of the day"
good,"Everything about working at Levi's Strauss was an excellent experience, the employees, customers, culture and history. However for the management it was a different story. Management at this particular store was terrible. The store manager was incredibly rude and I mean the store manager had no respect towards the entire management team and entire staff. I felt bad for some of the managers at the store because of how poorly they were treated by the store manager. Hopefully the store management changes because Levi's was an enjoyable place to work excluding the store manager."

Management was professional                                                        Hardest part of job: being away from family during long hours                The most enjoyable part of job: being around co-workers that make you laugh during work."

good,"•	Built brand focus in conjunction with operational requirements and ensured proper visual display for gaining maximum brand visibility and capture optimum market shares."
good,"My typical day at Levi consists of primarily managing the shop floor. This includes directing and supporting other colleagues in their work, as well as working with customers, identifying their needs and finding them the perfect pair of jeans. I take great satisfaction being in charge of visualisation within the store, meeting both company guidelines as well as other visual aspects including mannequins and product placement.  I also heavily support management accepting and processing deliveries onto the internal system and making appropriate adjustments. Alongside this it is my job to file away weekly paperwork and complete till audits. I also review sales-personnel  P.S.T. and help them step by step to grow and improve on these results."
good,"A typical work day consisted of arriving to clock in, straightening the store, greeting customers, pointing them in the right direction, suggesting product combinations for them, assigning fitting rooms, and working the cash-wrap. I loved my managers and co-workers, we all worked together very well. The hardest part of the job was dealing with thieves (happened quite often), while the most enjoyable part of the job for me was doing the cash wrap. That's when I got the opportunity to talk to the customers as a person, many would talk about their lives and I enjoyed getting to know people on a personal level to provide good customer service."
good,It's a great place to work with great coworkers and help great customers.
good,"I was in charge of the cash register, handling money throughout the day from guest transactions as well as opening and closing drawer money counts. I was responsible for cleaning the store and stocking the back when shipments came in. Customer service was my highest priority, providing the customers with the answers to their questions about the product and history of Levis. On a daily basis, I resolved issues and dealt with customer complaints as necessary. "
good,As I worked on this company my interpersonal relationship has improved and helped me widened my communication skills through continuous interaction with costumers
good,"Helping customers, telling jokes with co workers, the best part was helping the ladies with their jeans :)"
good,"I worked at Levis for over 35 years , all of my management skills came from here , all of my human skills came from here, all of my people skills came here , at times I really miss it"
good,"um dia de trabalho requer esforço e detrminação ainda mais por ser comercio, aprendi a valoriza meu trabalho e as pessoas pois comercio mexe diretamente com publico e cansatico trabalha finais de semana e com horarios entendidos mais o am,biente harmoniozo faz tudo ser mais facil."
good,Verkaufsgespräch führen
good,I can honestly say that I enjoyed my employment opportunity at this employer. My position was only seasonal but very educational. i learned how to fold jeans and move at a fast pace while helping many customers at once. My Co Workers were really cool and very welcoming. The most difficult part of this opportunity was learning the product in a short time.
good,ive learned how to interact with customers more fluently. very fast paced but with the staff there it goes by fast. hardest part about the job is when you arent on the same page as everyone else.
good,"Workplace culture is very friendly, with management encouraging and uplifting stylists to succeed in achieving daily targets as well as have an enjoyable day at work. Levis Strauss is a great community to be part of."
good,"Pretty straight forward job, wont be hard once you gain the knowledge on the product. Management was alright but could've been better. Great place as a first job for high school students"
good,Discount is amazing and you also get first pick on sale items. Lots of hours to pick up. Coworkers are all very nice and usually stay there for a very long time.
good,Was a good experience and made me fall in love with retail because talking to people was always extremely fun and showed me how to deal with difficult people.
good,"I worked as a seasonal. I was hired originally for sales, however an opening for stock arise and was given that job through request. I loved everything while working there, there were times items weren't available and I had to confront potential customers. I chose to work as stock to lessen my interactions with customers. My managers were all great and very understanding. I am sure since my time there, the managers have moved on as well. My coworkers were also great."
good,Levi's was my first professional company... I have learned a lot as a young man just starting the carrier. It was early 90's. The management of the company were very openminded.
good,"- supportive management"
good,"LS&CO provides opportunities to advance in your career with them by giving their employees proper training, extensive training on historical background of company. The Company teaches you the fundamentals of customer service, teamwork and work ethic. Working with LS&Co. taught me things about working that I have been able to apply to my other jobs."
good,"Really enjoyed working here, definitely I can see myself go back.  Systems are dated but the expectations seem to be line with the reality of the tools given to you.  The people are great and so is the culture. Sometimes you work in an industry where what you do may not make a difference to society when that is the case it is great to know the company you work for does make a difference.  And Levi's definitely makes a difference."
good,"If you have knowledge or passion about fashion and denim, Levi's may be a rewarding place to work. Levi's has various incentive and reward programs such as receiving free clothes if sales goals are met. The company may be a little dated on operations and software. My store was a beta testing location for the Apple ipad Point Of Sale system. This presented difficulties when ringing up customers or checking inventory as the software was not reliable."
good,"Typically worked 4 hours and was able to have flexible hours when still at college. Management and other co-workers were extremely friendly and inclusive, you got a good vibe out of the atmosphere. "
good,typical day at work was folding jeans and selling jeans.
good,"The general manager and employees are nice people. "
good,"This was a great first job. It showed me how well I was with the general public, I loved interacting with employees and loved helping out my coworkers."
good,I had a great time working at Levi's. We had monthly sales goal that we need to achieved and when we did we would get one free item up to $100. The pay was good considering how laid back it was most times. Managers were friendly and easy to talk to.
good,"I enjoyed working at levi's even though it was a seasonal job. Work days were relaxed and fun, except for black Friday and the week before Christmas. Had very good managers who where willing to work with you on hours and sick time."
good,"Working at Levi's was a great experience. My boss and co-workers were awesome and I learned a lot about retail. Also, I progressed a lot in my customer service skills."
good,Levi's was my first job.in first I was nervous.but after some days the job became easier fr me handling customer giving them their collection of clothes n the right fit of denim which make them happy it was really easy.the main pledge of our store was target achieve the target by hook or crook n to get it customer satisfaction was the first thing.n we're able to achieve our every month target
good,This was a small environment on 1 floor so you could easily reach out to people as needed far quicker. Most of the time you could just walk down the hall to a person's cubicle.
good,Knowledge of the history of the company. You learn what best fits your body. Coworkers were really fun. A lot of group activities and lots of tourists.
good,There isn't anything too special about working retail in my opinion but the job is easy and the people I worked with were awesome.
good,typical work day is very fun and energetic. We get people from all walks of life and interacting with them is the most fun part of my life.
good,"I loved working for LS&Co. The work was challenging and I was pushed to be my best self. The work culture was supportive and my manager found professional development of his employees to be important. Communication was very clear, efficient and effective."
good,Ik heb hier 2 jaar met plezier gewerkt. Ze doen veel moeite om mensen op te leiden en te laten groeien en te laten door groeien. Echter ligt natuurlijk ook heel veel aan de manager zelf. Ze hebben veel bonussystemen om wat extra's voor jezelf en team te krijgen.
good,"Levi's was a great place to work with a great family environment."
good,"For my first ""real"" job it was very enjoyable. The work itself was very easy, but I just had to make sure I did what I was told or else the managers were not happy; and really, there is always something to do so it really wasn't often at all that I was told to work harder. I found that interacting with customers was very easy and surprisingly enjoyable, and talking with the managers and fellow associates when the store wasn't busy made me grow pretty close to some of them. Shifts range from about 4 hours to 8 hours and beyond, and they seemed to really fly by since I was always doing something. Shifts longer than 5 hours required that I take a 30 minute, unpaid, break and it felt like just enough time to relax a bit and find some place to eat. Overall nothing was extremely difficult, and at times it was quite fun. Definitely recommend this place for college-level kids who like a busy, professional yet very casual, atmosphere."
good,"mon experience dans la vente c'est améliorer grandement."
good,"Tough, but very skill-building. Requires an open mind and a listening ear for every aspect of the entire job. As long as you're able to remind yourself that the customer's anger, etc.. is not towards or about you and are able to read between the lines, you will do excellently."
good,"enjoyed working there the staff was very friendly and very easy to get along with."
good,"Working at Levi's was a great experience. Throughout the years I learned a lot about denim history and ways to increase the longevity of products. Also, working alongside the District Manager taught me about data analysis & product management for high volume stores."
good,Amazing for high school students but not a realistic job to pay bills with especially if you're a sales associate. management are super cool and the company itself is amazing with all their health programs and donation programs employees can get into with the company.
good,"Se valora mucho el crecimiento personal y tu opinión es siempre recibida. "
good,"At Levi's there are obviously a lot of jeans, all different styles, fits and models; management really strives for all associates to be knowledgeable in all of the fits, what the fits do to the wearer, how they compliment one's features and we do actually style each consumer. "
good,Levis is a great place to work . Like all jobs there are some ups and downs but  working for Levis is great . It is one of my favourite jobs that i have had. I have learned so much in my short time of working there and i hope it continues that way on the future.

good,"En particular, no sólo desarrollo una buena jornada laboral con el cliente sino también la gente que al igual que yo, vela por ello; como mis compañeros de Trabajo, este punto es importante, pues son las personas que compartes diario a diario. Tratando a la gente tal como eres, se evitan mayores problemas. "
good,"A typical work day would include putting on name tag, grabbing walkie- talkie, helping customers find specific jeans that would fit them. I learned all I could about properly folding jeans and how to appropriately address customers. My managers would help each individual worker and help them with their weaknesses to get them to where they needed to be within the organization. Many of my co- workers would mess around and talk to each other. It was a big temptation not to join in but I would busy myself with helping customers. The most enjoyable part is when I helped a customer and they would thank me for helping."
good,A good place to work. Great pay. Great benefits. Great opportunities for advancement. Management cared about their employees and gave appropiate time for cross training on different postions
good,"Long hours, extreme performance expectations and minimal support. Upper management is awesome, middle management is questionable and store level management in great."
good,Typical day at work starts at 9:15 Am till 5:45 pm.We have regular Design work & meetings. Over 5+ yrs of working I have build my knowledge on Denim fabric & finishes.Co- Worker are supportive & fun people to work with.The hardest part of the job is the data entry work which eats in to your design work at time. The most fun part about the job is to work on new creative idea's every season.
good,"It was a pretty standard store environment, we were always doing something, whether it was helping customers, adjusting displays, or restocking shelves. the company had a really comprehensive training program, and taught us a lot about the product. The management staff was very friendly, but they were always about the bottom line, the staff was all friends while we were working together."
good,"This retail job was my first job in which I was hired as sales associate and was later promoted to look supervisor. I learned how to communicate with all types of people and give direction. In summary, I was in charge of the store when the assistant or store manger were not there. I had to keep track of sales and money while giving my employees direction and breaks. "
good,i was a sales asst. and i did alot like folding clothes cashier fitting room gretter i was doing alot and the co workers around made it fun being joly but the hardest day is around shopping and its the enjoyable time to because u get to meet new ppl

good,"Amazing job, amazing people. Great opportunities to grow in the company and many ways to be successful. Hardest part is folding all the jeans and having to change the store for inventory."
good,"A typical day at work for a stylist consists of greeting and talking to customers, helping them find sizes and the right fits for them. Also running the registers and working on shipment. Management is fun to work with and very friendly. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with customers if the store gets busy, and the most enjoyable part is meeting new people and making new friends."
good,the store mainly consists of jeans so it is not too challenging. A bit boring at times since the store wasn't that big and they didn't have a variety of retail items.
good,Levi Strauss & Co. has given such a great opportunity to advance my knowledge of retail by giving me hands on experience with customer service. They have taught me to engaging to the needs of all customers and to be sensitive to the views of other employees.
good,"didnt really nlearn none much, but the management was alright. all co workers got along aand worked good and well. hardest part was working in very hot temp. and very cold and long hours."

good,"I learned how to multistage customers, a day at LEVIS  was always fun and upbeat the staff is one of a kind, extremely helpful especially to first time retail workers. The hardest part during the holidays is the increase in traffic, besides that this is a great place to work at."
good,Levi's is a good place to work. They have a good management team and I've grown a lot since I've worked there.
good,"Levi's encouraged cross-functional communication and dialog to drive business.  Brainstorming was rewarded and opinions valued.  Back to back meetings were typical, and sometimes it was hard to get things accomplished because of ""red tape"" and ""hoops.""  Culture is extremely loyal and proud of the brand, nice and respectful of others.  Levi's openly supported rights of all individuals, and very involved in charities."

good,"I had a great experience working here. Managers were always happy and ready to cheer you up to warm up the day."
good,General production included working on different machines in the area to successfully produce products. This was a team oriented environment and everyone depended on each other to complete the products. This was very fast paced. 
good,Working in a distribution center with heavy machinery is a different experience. Especially one filled with mostly jeans. It was a great job. Levi's takes care of it's employees and reminds you of the benefits of working for an international billion dollar corporation.

good,"bonne ambiance au sein de l'équipe de vente, une bonne collaration avec le responsable du magasin"
good,"Oferecia muitas oportunidades de aprendizado com cursos treinamentos e convenções, a gerência sempre oferecia oportunidades de crescimento profissional e aumento de responsabilidade, a parte mais fácil era o relacionamento com o cliente, pois me acho bem comunicativo e a parte mais dificil era os trabalhos nos fim de semana."
good,"- Diverse culture and focus on diversity"
good,A typical day at Levis is fun and very competitive. I learned how to work in a fast paced environment. The management is loose but strict when it needs to be. the hardest part is adapting to the needs of the workplace. the most enjoyable part is being able to talk with everyone and network.
good,Typical day included greeting customers and assisting them with finding fit and style of Jeans. Management was extremely helpful nice to work with.

good,A typical day included doing research for claims and answering phone calls. Constantly pulling spreadsheets and analyzing data.I learned some new things about the order entry size of things. Management was pretty off hands but very friendly to interact with. The culture was very relaxed. Jeans every day of the week. Hardest part of the job was wearing many hats with different job duties. Most enjoyable part of the job was having friends at work.
good,"learning the products and how different and unique each jean is, it is thrilling. especially after you've learned them and you use that knowledge to get the sale!"
good,"A typical day of work at levi's was to be assigned a zone and try to make all my goals in that zone. Sales,productivity, and recovery were the number one goals. At the end of a shift I would hand off my tools to the next shift and set them up for success. I learned a great deal but not just about product, I learned that accountability and responsibility would get me far and i saw that from how the people at Levi's treated me. Which they were awesome and I would love to go back either as an employee or just to thank them again for believing in me. The hardest part wasn't the hardest at all, i would say just trying to communicate with people who didn't speak my language but most of the time we were able to provide them with what they were looking for. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and gaining new friendships at work and outside of work."

good,"The typical day at Levi's is interesting. Working at Levi's teaches you that work can be a fun, interactive experience. Management is very welcoming and friendly. The workplace culture seems to reflect management. I would say the hardest part of the job was working in the stock room, but that is my own preference. My favorite part of the job was helping customers."

good,I began working there in 2010 and ended in 2014. The job was suitable for me then when there was not much to worry about bill wise.  Compensation is not adequate for a college graduate.
good,"begått upplevt fyra år, distribution storskalig och visual merchandising, utmärkt kommunikation och social kompetens, snygg, villig bestäms. flytande engelska med certifikat och franska och Spagno skolan god nivå. god användning pc, och stort värde för alla ""inne i en arbetsgrupp"
good,A typical day at work could be a challenge to meet production. I learned that if you apply the waist band to the jeans wrong it can alter the size of the jeans. There were some coworkers that were great. The hardest part of the job was meeting production because it dropped constantly especially when you went to lunch. The most enjoyable was learning something new.
good,Typical days at work are fine and I don’t have problems. It is tiring at times but I like being with customers to help with. The management team are great. Co-workers are somewhat okay to work with.
good,"A typical day at Levi Strauss may include: doing inventory on new shipment, re-organizing the floor, helping customers find things within the store and giving them the details about sales and promotions. The most enjoyable part is helping customers find what they are looking for and getting to know each customer. The hardest part may be time management and making sure you are in two places at once."
good,"E uma empresa no ramo de vestuario em shop, para se ter um bom salario e necessario trabalhar bastante alem da sua jornanda de trabalho, para trabalhar com vendas tem que gostar muito"
good,Bueno desde mi punto de vista es una cadena de tiendas de muy buen ver con proyecciones factibles a futuros y su mision y vision claros.
good,When I started at Levi's I enjoyed everything I learn to many things.I grow to much in this company.But the management team change and is a very stressful work in this company.
good,A typical day at Levi's on 42nd was very busy. Whatever you may have been thinking about before the day began is filled with running around and work. There is always a way to keep busy at Levi's either folding down the long walls and keeping your section intact to servicing a large variety of consumers who were majority tourists. The managers come down hard on people to stay in their sections but really one section is all you can handle at a time! All in all I loved the business of it all. They are very humanitarian and often make efforts to join in community based fund raisers such as Breast Cancer Awareness and donations yearly to the Aids walk.
good,Working here I’ve learned a lot about jeans that’s helpful. My Store Manager seems like she would need more training. She shows favoritism. That’s the only thing about this job I don’t like.
good,"Aucun avis"
good,"Продажа,приемка товара,складывание, и призентация товара.Мерчиндайзенгу научилась).Трудна монотонная работа складывания,и инвентаризация.Наиболее приятная часть работы-это обед и перекур.А доброе и открытое руководство-приветствуется!Без этого никуда!А коллектив,-должен быть доброжелательным,общительным и позитивным!"

good,I have done
good,Hours for supervisors can be 5 am - 2 pm or 4 pm - 12 am. My position was used to fill needs of the store other managers didn't want to do. Very low pay as I was promoted from sales associate. Loved the product and the customers. Associates were paid a little over minimum wage. Lots of favoritism involved and not everyone was treated equally. Hardest part of the job was the varied hours and extreme work load.
good,It was a hectic day at work always but fun. We would always stay late at work fixing the jeans and make sure that the jeans looked displayable for the next day. I learned how to speak a little bit of Portgeugese to speak to others. I learned how to manage a group whenever i was plaed in charge. My co workers were always pretty fun and wouldnt let you be down. The hardest part of the day was trying to se;; several pairs of jeans to one person. And the best was the closing part. It was always fun fixing the store with the crew.
good,Chegamos na loja pela manha e arrumamos e organizamos tudo. A gerencia é muito amigavel e compreensiva. aprendi como atender bem um cliente e como me relaciona com o publico variado. Aparte mais dificil é bater meta e a parte mais agradavel são os colegas ajudando um ao outro.
good,"It was awesome working there but the management wasn’t. No room for growth, improvement, or even be part of a leadership program. The company overall was amazing"
good,Enjoy working there. Need to assist customers. Get commissions on sales. A very good helping team. Can change shift if there's an emergency. Very friendly team.

good,the company hire very intelligent and  friendly people so working alongside new colleagues was never an issue.The managers also monitored performance based on KPI;s which meant the whole team had to work hard individually to make sales.
good,Levi Strauss is a great company who gives the opportunity to people with disabilities like me without previous experience to work. It provided me with a warm and safe environment in order for me to produce the demands of this company. Excellent administration treatment towards employees. The most enjoyable part of my job is to help customers to find want the are looking for; offering them with good quality products and prices. The hardest part of my job is when I have to close the store due to all the mess left.
good,"I really enjoyed this job and never intended to leave. It is fast paced, but with fast pace comes errors sometimes. They are harsh on you when you make a mistake. I understand a company dont want to send out an order and it not be correct, but human error does happen at times. Otherwise, I loved this job. Peak season on the other hand can be very stressful. You can work 7 days a week for up to 3 months strait with no days off, mandatory overtime. The pay is great, but it takes a toll on your body and mind."
good,was very good job could become stressful very physcally demanding in my area loved the job pay was not good but it was yrs ago things have changed would work for this company again only had one bad supervisor
good,"Faced-paced environment but with nice, hard-working individuals. Managers are very fair and want to see you advance! Work life balance is great and they allow you to work from home if needed."
good,"Entering the store during my shift is pretty laid back.  I get my headset, start organizing the clothes or being on the register.  I've learned to be organized, proficient at the register, and how to fold clothes.  Everybody I worked with was easy going.  Hardest part of the job is being confined into small spaces, and not being able to wear what you want.  I did like my boss, and my co workers."
good,Bonne évolution en règle générale au sein de cette entreprise
good,a typical workday was pretty busy alot of people come to shop for jeans. i learned how to work with many different people and how to multitask. my manager was very cool she did her job but she was very calm didnt yell too much just made sure everything was in order. the hardest part about the job was when it was really busy like weekends or holidays.
good,"the best part was working in a small fun team, and getting to know customers. worst part was always being hassled for KPIs which was very pressurising."
good,Loved working within the distribution environment. It was fast paced and plenty of work. There are multiple types of jobs within the facility to accommodate your skills. Training is always available upon request. Great benefits. Overtime is available.

good,"Fun place to work with direct interaction with upper heads.Retails operation is a major work what we used to do, accounting and reconciliations (accounts/inventory) is one of the task."
good,"Selvedge, raw, 100% cotton, and spandex denim are the few key points that I learned when working at levi. My customer service interaction ultimately began once I started working for Levi. My favorite moments when working at Levi was working in the fitting room. I was the go to person when it came to proper denim fits.I know how to differentiate what denim style will fit a person by looking at them. The brand has a substantial clientele that will always be faithful. However, I'm not working for Levi any long but my heart will always be with them in my high rise skinny jeans."

good,"Levis was great. The managers were very cool and considerate. I learned a lot about retail during the 3 years I worked there. It is a huge store so I met tons of people, co workers were cool also. The hardest part of the job would probably have to be closing the store. It is a big store so we would have to clean up after closing hours and it took a few hours to finish every night. The most enjoyable part was just working there in general."
good,"Very fast paced environment where I polished my customer service skills and on-the-ball thinking. It was a bit hectic getting used to the atmosphere of the store, but after a few days the speed became routine, and I learned to exhibit top quality service at all times on the job. Staff was not the most responsive, but managers did a great job setting aside time for meetings, status updates, and necessary training. Overall a great experience!"
good,"•Assist customers in trying on merchandise"

good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is every day is different, meeting new people and working with the best team I have ever worked with."
good,a typical day at work we would restock jeans and put them in the right order on the shelves. I learned about different jean sizes.

good,patients all love the doctor. She was always readily available to assist a patient when they needed her.
good,"The coolest thing ever about working for Levi Strauss is meeting the coolest people in the world who love them. It is more than an American brand, it is American Culture, and the thread that bonds people from one country to the next. Lifting, pulling and styling is always worth it, when the alchemy of a perfect jean turn your customer from a frog to a prince."
good,I was a sewing machine operator that did different jobs in order to make the garment.
good,"Pues llegar a mi lugar y preparar las actividades a realizar en el dia o los pendientes, aprendí a darle valor a las actividades realizadas y a que respetaran mi trabajo. tener la mayor comunicación posible con el equipo ya que a diario surgían prioridades. La parte más difícil, cuando nadie está de acuerdo en algo o no le quieren dar valor al esfuerzo realizado, entonces habrá que ingeniárselas y hacerlos entender con claridad para que lo acepten. Lo que mas me gusto, que tenían muy bien definidos los intereses y valores de la compañía y la transmisión constante de los mismos."
good,"A wonderful place to work for that is fun and exciting! The customers that come into the store are the best part, as it is always exciting helping them organize outfits."

good,"I assist in the daily tasks of the garment developer, product developer and sundry developer. There is plenty of opportunity to learn something new every day. My co-workers are friendly and great people to learn from. "
good,"In a typical day I work with customers one on one to make sure they are receiving an exceptional level of customer service. This particular store is a one of a kind store and the product we carry is exclusive to us and only two other Levi's stores in the world, so it is imperative that every customer is given this knowledge and understands the significance. I also have a major role in the creative direction of the store merchandising. We do not have to follow specific company guidelines for store layout and mannequin styling, so we have immense creative freedoms. This aspect is what I love most about the job and what I feel I excel the best at. I love working with my small team of co-workers to help customers and merchandise the store. It is a relaxed and enjoyable environment."
good,Team working is very important and I have learned that I can be a team player and work by myself. Both suit me.
good,It was a way I learned how to actually sell products and convince customers on buying our products and told them they were perfect for it. It was hectic yet amazing

good,"It was a very great company to work for that provided numerous incentives and offered flexible hours. The only thing is really with higher management. There really wasn’t structure or encouragement coming from the general manager. It fostered an unhealthy and toxic working environment due to gossip and negativity. Besides management, the company itself is great to work for."
good,"Awesome work environment, great people, flexibility, good pay. Management is awesome, people are friendly and always pay attention to detail. Always striving to create an awesome work environment!"
good,"Great place to work.  The atmosphere isn't too stressful.  Levi's is a great brand and they are continuing to expand.  The recent acquisition of the football stadium just shows the opportunities that lie ahead for the brand.  The effect this has on associates is that there will be great things happening in the future and they get to be apart of it.  During my time at Levi's I've learned so much and though much time has passed, it feels like this is just the beginning."
good,"Fun retail outlet to work at part-time! As a cashier, you have a lot of responsibility for cash handling, as well as, making sales."
good,"Muy interesante la formación, y el día a día con mis compañeros genial, pero no era el tipo de contrato que buscaba."
good,"A franquia que trabalhei tem uma ótima gerência, é bem estratégica, e tem ótimos colegas de trabalho. O treinamento é excelente, porém, depende do colaborador aplicar o conhecimento ou não. A conciliação entre vida pessoal e trabalho é muito ruim, pois, os horários são distribuídos de forma que, aos sábados, o colaborador trabalhe quase o dia inteiro. Contudo, a empresa tem tudo para crescer, seus produtos são ótimos e o atendimento é espetacular."
good,"It was great working there. I was on 2nd shift my schedule was supposed to be Monday- Thursday, 10hr shift. My only complaint is you have constant MANDATORY overtime and end up working 7 days a week for months on end. I was LUCKY to have 2 non-consecutive days off for 8 months straight. It was like that every year. 1st shift and weekend shift didn't have as much mandatory overtime as 2nd shift did."
good,"Um ambiente bem agradável e familiar. Bem gestada e organizada, com horários, pagamentos e horas extras correto. "
good,"Gostava muito de trabalhar na empresa, gostaria de ter passado mais tempo e assim ter crescido na empresa como profissional. Ajudando a marca a crescer no meu estado também."
good,Es buena empresa cuenta con todos los protocolos de seguridad
good,"Meus dias sempre voltado para o resultado;"
good,"Excelente empresa que comienza a entrar al mundo del retail , posicionándose en el mercado "
good,"Comfortable work environment where engagement of employees are considered with utmost importance. Levis believes in an American style of working, which might cause an employee to stay late in the office or do office on weekends."
good,"Great place to work if you are not high tech person. Higher managers are great, and they want to help in success of all employee. And willing to take of them with good benefits."
good,"Fun to work place, super friendly environment for customers of all ages. Flexible shifts and days off. Best part is when management and customers value your hard work."

good,Great environment to work in with a great team at your side. Best part was making sales bad part is that they take make u do a permanent staffs job which is not a good thing. ( footwear trading)
good,"I started working for Levi's in 2006. I worked my way up the chain to Store Manager and then left for an advancement with Carhartt. I have recently returned, but not to the same store I previously managed. I was SM for a Mainline loaction- higher price points, lifestyle branding, new breakthrough collections, a true expression of the brand image. I currently work at an Outlet location and the differences are sometimes pretty extreme. Outlet is by nature more fast-paced, but instead of selling a lifestyle, it is mainly about pushing product. This is good for promotions and advancements because it shows that you can manage a hefty workload but it comes at the cost of truly living the brand. "
good,there is no fun at workplace so that you will feel like enjoying the work too many unnecessary restrictions by which employee gets frustrated and that leads to lack of concentration.
good,"mostly selling jeans and talking to customers"
good,"A typical day at Levi's was to make sure the store was in top shape. I learned how to read the different types of customers. My manager was a great manager. She coached the staff so well, we had great customer service. The hardest part about the job was dealing with customers that had tempers. Even when dealing with customers like that you always want to keep cool."
good,"Unfortunately this division of the organization was downsized and chose to use contractors for the manufacturing portion of the company.  Privately owned, advancement opportunities existed in other divisions.  Employees receive great benefits."
good,The work days we're hard but fun. I learned a lot about leadership and communication skills. The best part of Levi's the customers. Managment is difficault but fun and reasonable. Most co-workers are easy to work with other are not so much. The hardest part of the job was being in the management position as a captain.
good,"Levi's is fantastic for anyone who wants to be in a stable selling environment. Over the past few years, management has been changing hands, but the upper management who is overseeing operations has been with LS&Co for some time. Very good team. Very good company to work for."
good,"The Levi’s and Strauss work environment was extremely enjoyable and refreshing with the help of an awesome team. All of my colleagues were energetic and contributed to the positive energy in the store. Not only did we focus on simply selling our merchandise, but we also learned the history behind the company. It was required for all workers to participate in a six-course program called Denim Leadership, which educated us on how to properly approach customers, how to use the tools and resources provided to us to ensure each customer had a great Levi’s experience, as well as background information on where and how the company’s merchandise was made. Although the training process was excellent, the hardest part about the job was dealing with difficult customers. However, I quickly learned that rude customers are apart of everyday life in the retail industry, and you can only try to make their experience a better one. The Levi’s that I worked at was located in Hawaii, which many people know is a huge tourist attraction; so I enjoyed meeting many different people from places all over the world on a day to day basis."
good,Its fun to style others that need the help. Management is a bit lazy but the job gets done. My co-workers are all upbeat and enjoyable to be around.
good,"muito boa de trabalhar, tem seus altos e baixos mas é uma empresa que da oportunidades para voce dar um salto para o futuro, e princilpalmente para area curricular"

good,"Very relaxed , easy paced work. Managment is laid back . Cool environment to advance in your career for retail professions.  My second home away from home"
good,Set list of doors that you have to service (merchandise) in order to make sure you achieve your sales goals. Make your own schedule and work at your own pace. Easy job when you network with the store teams and ask for assistance because most of the time you are working by yourself.
good,"Otima empresa para trabalhar excelente estrutura de trabalho...o maior problema e que nao dão oportinidades de efetivação para funcionários terceirizados."
good,Overall this was a great place to be co-wokers were team players we all work together couldn't ask for nothing better although it were time you just had to get away and find some me time. Lol. Yes I would go back in a heart beat.
good,learned a lot from my co workers. They showed me the ropes around the store making it easier for me to move around and work. everyone around the warehouse was ready to work which is one of the things i liked most. Basically you do your job and was there to work.
good,Levi is a great company to work for. I enjoy all the people there and the environment as well. No one is there to criticize you for not knowing something. They welcome you with open hands.
good,Its a basic sales job where people are upbeat and fun to be around. If your looking to get your feet wet in employment its a great starter job. If your looking to get a little extra cash on the side they were at least with me flexible.
good,"My typical day at work was fun for me, I always enjoyed working at levi's. I learned how to fold the jeans, properly  place them on shelves and how to size them. My manager was a great help in my training process and so helpful."
good,"Most definitely my favorite retail position.  I really believed in the product quality and pricing which made it easy to promote, wear and sell.  Management then was the best I had ever experienced in retail as far as fairness, the willingness to train and provide detailed instruction for advancement and an almost too kind heart."
good,"I worked there for a short time but did not really ever have a bad experience while working thanks to the staff who were usually pretty cool and it being a smaller store was pretty easy to keep nice and neat.  The SM is a pretty cool person who of course is get to work and sell sell sell but because she has to be it's her job to make sure the store is running in proper order and from my point of view i think she does one heck of a job doing it, especially since the store is usually under staffed. your work duties are selling and making sure the place is kept clean, it's simple and if you are looking for somewhere to work i recommend putting in an app."
good,"operations of 3 stores. knowledge of different fits of jeans .recruitment and staffing , grooming of staffs ,monitoring day to day operations , handling customer complaints etc"
good,"Fun place to work. perfect fit for anyone who loves meeting new people. Employees are very young and vibrant. Management great as well, always willing to help."

good,"hardest part of sales executive is control the angry customer and try to convience them for the related query,,,,and always motivate our collegues.."
good,"I started working during the summer so I would work a lot. I enjoyed the people and the environment. Once, Fall semester started for school, it was hard to get scheduled for work. During Christmas break, my manager stopped scheduling me so I decided to put my two weeks in."
good,"great working environment positive, motivating, knowledge co-workers. the management trained me very well in sales. Levi's is of course a very well know brand so a good company to have on a resume."
good,the job was good good co workers the management was awful..would not recommend anybody that wants to move up in the company to work for levis

good,Levis and Strauss family will always be in my heart. They supported all of the sales representatives and showed were amazing
good,"I had the amazing opportunity to work for Levi's in Tempe Arizona for little over five months and learned so much about customer service, sales, and overall growth within a company under a short amount of time."
good,Een leuk bedrijf met potentieel heel goede training programma's en opties. Het hoofdkantoor van Levi's Europa ligt dan ook in Diegem België.
good,Our typical day was very customer service oriented. Processing incoming for over stock and back stock. Organizing store from for merchandise. And evaluation schedules on the daily basis to assure hours were with in budget. Management was a great leader and motivate. The most enjoyable part about Levis is the fun and out going environment created by staff. 
good,"This is the good brand and culture "
good,"People are nice there , you move around a lot . ..........................…….........................."
good,Very fun experience I really enjoyed retail and I feel like Levi is a great place to start for first timers the only reason I left is because the lack of hours other than that no complaints
good,"Es un buen lugar para trabajar. Excepto por el sueldo siento que es muy manchado para los vendedores , se les condiciona y precionar bastante, como gerenciales es un poco más accesible. "
good,Working at Levi Strauss was an interesting and great work environment. There were great benefits and fair treatment. I recommend Levi Strauss to anyone.
good,"Uma boa Empresa para se trabalhar, mas fica um pouco engessada pelo Supervisor..."
good,It is pretty much laid back if you are good worker and can keep it will go smooth. You can dress comfortably and not much or any hard work.Good work opportunity
good,"A typical day at work would include light cleaning, assisting customers, calling the back via walkie talkie to check on products for customers, managing the fitting rooms and cash wrap as well as greeting customers and organizing product. I learned how to fold jeans and almost every type of jean that exists. Management was very relaxed but also made sure you did your job. Workplace culture was fun and I made several friends there. The hardest part of the job was the seasonal position that included working with multiple customers at a time and having the store jammed full of people. The most enjoyable part of the job is the incentives and I enjoyed organizing."
good,"Folded pants, put merchandise back, provided great customer service was able to assist speak Spanish to the customers who needed help. Good company to work for especially being a college student able to work around your school schedule."
good,Would get a good amount of hours and were very flexible with my schedule. While there were certain questionable decisions management made regarding other sales associates and their lack of effort put in during their shifts. Despite this I was praised for the efficiency and quality of my work.
good,"Working at LEVI  STRAUSS was quite an experience but, it was fun the co-workers and all. I would go back at a drop of a dime. Being there  was like being at home cause i was their most of the time from 1;30 in the afternoon until 2;45 in the morning it worked out just fine.     Although , I'm not sure about my fellow co-workers it seem they would complain about being on their feet so long and that the breaks wasn't long enough but, they keep coming back"
good,"Excellent working condition ,good incentive schemes and friendly environment ,the outlet is located in the heart of kottayam town and also could able to gain knowledge due to the interaction with different types of customers"
good,"Loved working at Levis,  A typical work day would include fixing fixtures, replenishment, helping out consumers by running to get sizes or a different fit, suggesting pieces to your consumer based on body language. While working here I learned to read every one of your consumers to better their experience, I learned the culture and history of a great company, Overall they helped me a lot with my customer service. Management was fairly easy. They expected you to get your job done while being pretty understanding. Hardest part of the job would of had to be deciding on where to put some of the figures without tweaking the rig too much. The store I was working at didn't have all of the expected fixtures so you had to make do which still ended up being a little fun. Most enjoyable part was knowing that each customer left satisfied with their purchase."
good,Overall Levi Strauss & CO great company. POOR judgment on management but very adventurous shifts. You learn so much during the orientation its almost exciting to know that those jeans are holy jeans.
good,"Pretty professional place, enjoyed working here. Learned a lot, people were great. Just completed my job and went home, Would definitely recommend to a friend in need."
good,"Levis was an excellent experience for me, I learned how to fold jeans coreectly, I was trained in cashier as well, did stock, and my co workers were great!"
good,"* Customer service satisfaction"
good,Great and fun environment to work in but has no benefits. I recommend for first retail job or for high school students. Customers are mostly tourists so patience and other language skills are extremely helpful.
good,"Working at Levi's was a very enjoyable experience. I had the pleasure of experiencing how helpful other people can be when you are in need of help and the silly disputes that happen from time to time among the workers. I learned how to appreciate certain things that I took for granted or never considered beforehand."

good,"Loved working with the Locust Grove team! I love the environment, casual work attire and the free-to-be mentality! However, the pay was just completely not going to work for me.  I tried to advance into management positions in other locations in Orlando, FL, but was overlooked, unfortunately so i had to make the hard choice of leaving the company altogether."
good,"The day started at 10:30 and we start with the daily SOP's and operations , morning briefieng"
good,"Very busy and very fast paced job. I've learned to balance different tasks all at once, be able to multi-task and be able to help more then one [person at a time. "
good,A great learning experience in Levis and all co-workers are very cooperative.The greatest part of the job is to provide the great customer service to existing customers and to attract new customers.To motivate the staff is also a great part.
good,A typical day at work for me would involve focusing on the over all look of the store.
good,"I loved my job as a stylist, but the job at my time in life was a bit too slow. I'm a recent grad with a daughter and I needed a more lucrative position to aid in paying bills and taking care of other necessities. I learned a lot about denim and its make-up. I was introduced to caring for denim to increase its longevity. As well, I got to meet some pretty interesting people from all walks of life."

good,Engaging with customers was the best part of my day. I learned the unique details of denim and Levi's history in general. The managers were friendly and very positive. My co workers were uplifting and fun to be around. The hardest part of my job was not talking to customers and the best part was the very fast paste and being able to help customers to satisfy.
good,I don't feel like doing this. I have not been there long and am looking for another job because I can not lift as much weight as I used to.
good,Levi's was a great first job in retail. They were extremely generous to their employees at Christmas and for their year anniversaries with the company. Management was great and effective. Hardest part of the job was measuring customers. Most enjoyable part of the job was the company gifts.

good,I learned about Levi's history. How much Levis cared about their customers.
good,"Upbeat employees"
good,"I only worked at Levi's for a few months before advancing on to another career choice but while there I had a great time. Folding pants all day can get tedious but the fun staff makes enjoyable. At this location, since it is a stop on the way to Vegas for the tour buses, I had to work with many people from different countries who don't speak any English. At first it was challenging but now I can say a few different phrases in about 6 different languages. The starting pay isn't much but the longer you work there and show that you are a hard worker you will start to get so many more hours and a higher pay rate. definitely a great job especially for people looking for their first job."
good,"ganhei habilidades para vendas e atendimento ao cliente, o trabalho era agradavel e a equipe era bem unida"
good,"Its was quite a good experience to working with this company. There was stress, the co-workers were very friendly and understanding. The working atmosphere was so good that you don't feel any kinda pressure. It helped me learn about the customer service."
good,I liked working with all my Co-workers
good,"A typical day at Levi's consisted of assisting multiple customers regarding size, style, and colors of merchandise. I learned how to assist customers without making them feel pressured to purchase an item. I also learned self control and restraint when dealing with irate customers. Management was highly supportive and made sure all team members were well suited to perform necessary tasks. My co-workers were awesome people that are never reluctant to help a fellow employee. The hardest part of the job was constantly standing, which could be a tad bit uncomfortable. The most exciting thing is working in a fast paced atmosphere with many goals to complete."
good,"Levis is a big corporation therefore there was a lot of business in that job. I was cashier and i would be busy from the hour i started to the hour i ended. However, i enjoyed it because i was able to interact with people from different parts of the world."

good,"I was only a seasonal hire however I found the work environment to be very cooperative and structured. The managers knew how to handle the store when it got busy and they knew how to address pricing issues, if products did not have tags, return issues, etc. They would regularly give us tasks that allowed for employees to express themselves, such as giving us an assignment about how to lay out new products. This is also the first company I've worked for that regularly made monthly goals, and meeting monthly goals allows each employee to receive a free item $100 or less in the store. Employees also get a 40% off discount in-store and online, and the company regularly increases the discount to 50% several weeks each month. I'm sad that I cannot work here longer because I really enjoyed my stay. I will definitely look for further employment with this company in the future."

good,Good retail experience with good management. Good communication from the coworkers and the managers will listen to concerns that you have in regards to schedule and job roles. Solid part time job for high school and college students.
good,"Similar to my previous positon, this job teaches me to always put the customer first, for instance, always addressing them and asking if they need help with anything so that they feel as if you're an approachable person. As well as this, ensuring that they’re never lost and/or ensuring that they can find the exact size/style of clothing they may need. Working here has taught me how to organize and make the shop floor look presentable. And as I final point, I have been ensuring that the stock on the shop floor is up to date so that we are never running low. Furthermore, I have also been trained as Levis Tailor in which I specialize in alterations meaning I do adjustments to the jeans to ensure that the products fit customers properly.  I am also able to make changes to garments, such as hemming pants to make them shorter or even turning jeans into shorts for customers so that they have bespoke clothing.  "

good,"Other than the cost of insurance being high, everything was great. They uphold the culture they put out in the media and are even better. You can see this at store level. Only thing to be wary of is the 3rd party HR services you have to deal with if you need medical leave. They are not honest (but they are not Levi's)."
good,Working at Levi's gave me a strong work ethic and gave me the retail experience that any young person in the work force dreams of. I learned so many different features that it takes to keep a store sufficient.
good,"Work culture was a loving, hospitable, and caring culture. It was a great environment to work in, it honestly felt like a family. Working with my coworkers was the best part of the job."
good,"My typical day at levi ... The Afternoon when we get busy i love to talk to the customer, meet new people talk about the brand and just smile while doing it.

The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with people.
good,"Busy and fun all the time! The managers were amazing and super helpful through work and life experiences, truly worked with amazing and helpful people. I learned how to market items to potential buyers and make our show rooms more appealing to consumers. Hardest part of this job since it is retail is the holiday season. It was a non stop work day and made it hard to take lunches and take time off. In the craziness of this job it was one of the best jobs I have ever had! I would recommend family and friends to this job."
good,This job is great for highschoolers or young adults home from college seeking work. Benefits are not enough to run a household on.
good,Times Square is a fun location to work in. Meet many people from different back grounds. A typical day at work consists of replenishing the table and fixing the stacks. Helping customers find their right fit and style of jeans. I have learned alot about the different kinds of denims and styles. My co-workers are all friendly. The hardest part of the job is standing. The most enjoyable part of the job is the friendships you make with your co-workers.

I not only worked as a cashier, but I ended up havin a great relationship with co-workers and the customers. I still miss being there everyday."
good,"Each day was challenging as we worked to reach our store target. I have leaned to be patient, to work under pressure, work independently. The management was excellent and my co-workers were great, enjoyed working with them as we worked we treated each other as a family. The hardest part of the job was when you have to deal with a difficult customer, disciplining your staff and not reaching your targets. The most enjoyable part of the job was when we receive new stock to have a busy selling hours and getting customers packed in the store, reaching our targets and getting incentives.Getting the respect and trust from the staff and being praised for a good job. Visiting orphanage homes and donating cash and clothes."

Me trouxe estabilidade e serenidade profissional. Tive a oportunidade de desempenhar diversos papeis, em diferentes áreas e aprender muito e contribuir com resultados concretos, o que causou enorme satisfação. A Levi's do Brasil no período que lá estive, tinha um grupo de profissionais excelente, que soube conduzir os negócios de forma madura e serena, mesmo enfrentando muitas crises econômicas no país. Fiz amigos que tenho até hoje. Os maiores desafios, eram atender de forma apropriada as demandas de consumidores e clientes, uma vez que a matriz tinha parâmetros de preços e produtos não alinhados ao do mercado local em muitos momentos. Por outro lado, esses desafios aumentavam o orgulho dos resultados e tornava a constante busca de alinhamento e atendimento dos vários agentes, num processo de criação e inovação, tornando nosso trabalho mais dinâmico e agradável."

good,Levi’s has a very open door policy for all management levels! The work/life balance is great! It’s gets a little more hectic at Christmas but that’s to be expected because it’s retail.
good,A great company to work for that prides itself on its history and returning  customers. Great product knowledge is essential as customers can be very particular.
good,"At my outlet store, I have worked with the best management team I have ever seen. There is not much room to move up, and they prefer to hire from outside rather than promote within. Pay starts at minimum wage. If your store makes its stretch sales goal for the month, everyone gets a free item. Very chill environment. Good discount: 40% off."
good,Levi's was a great place to work.  The sales force was just opening up for women and Levi's was aggressively recruiting. It was so much fun working for the NYC district office and then having the opportunity to move all over the country.

I've met people from all over the globe who come to Levi's when they visit the States ( it's all considerably cheaper here than anywhere else)."
good,"either picking units or loading trucks you have to be fast and safe all the time,they have time limits on the job at Levi Strauss. You have  a percentage that you have to make by the end of the week and if you don't make it you will receive a write up on it. After 4 write ups you can be fired."
good,"trainers arent very thorough and rush through the process so be sure to ask questions, great benefits to working here. not enough hours if you need them, very flexible."
good,Very easy job needing little experience. You are tasked with selling and folding Levi Brand clothing. The hardest part of the job would probably be resets is you get that far along which is completely rearranging the store which is still not much of a difficult task.
good,My job was to help the customers to find what they are looking for and provide them with valuable and true opinion. I learned negotiating skills and customer service skills. It was all fun and everything was great.

good,Entreprise où l'on se sent en famille. Travail dans la bonne humeur
good,"Levi's is a great company that treats its employees very well. However, there could be improvement in employee advancement."
good,"As a South Florida native who has worked many eccentric jobs, Levi's is by far the most ""normal"" job I've had and, so far, my favorite one too. The customers you encounter are generally friendly and are always open to not only tell you their size, but what they wear their jeans for and why they love Levi's. You get to learn a lot about your consumers and most of them are truly appreciative of your help. The management really wants to give tools that will help you succeed in the real world and they even show you the basics of the business to make you feel more like you're part of the team. The clean-up is a little overwhelming, but with teamwork, the other associates and I are always able to leave the store in great condition and go home at a reasonable and safe hour."

good,"en un día típico se pasa bien con los compañeros es una distracción mientras uno va trabajando,mis compañeros son excelentes al momento de que uno llega y es nuevo en la empresa te revisen de buena manera hacen que uno trabaje en un ambiente grato."
good,Run sales Floor with an awesome team of stylists ready to lead customers from point of engagement to point of sale.
good,Working at Levi's is always fun since just about everyone there has an outgoing personality and is right around my age. The managers want us to accomplish our sales goals and constantly find ways to encourage us in order to make that happen. The best part of the job is being able to help people who don't know a lot about style/jeans and making them look good. The hardest part is perhaps being able to multitask since many times you have to help more than one customer at a time.
good,"Its a fun place to work at and its a different environment. The different cultures of the customers and so many different languages and tourists that come visit,"
good,"Aprendi a me comunicar melhor, a trabalhar em equipe e a ser mais organizado."
good,"Working for Levi Strauss I would enter the showroom and help people choose fashionable apparel from our pioneering clothing and lifestyle. I learned how to talk to people but more importantly I learned how to listen and be presentable. Management was great they would instruct us with vigor and do wonders to motivate the team. My Co-workers were amazing and very kind. The hardest part of the job was re-organizing the store after we closed but the most enjoyable part was hearing a ""thank you"" from the customers and actually knowing you had helped them."
good,"I enjoyed coordinating floor sets and taking after photos of all the merchandising that was completed. It always showed the departments full potential, and as sales increased you knew your efforts and hard work paid off."
good,Trained many different people on how to do their jobs safely and timely
good,Fantastic retail experience. Co-workers are well mannered and friendly.
good,I valued my work experience at Levi Strauss & Co. Their core values and reputation fostered pride in the workplace and a team environment. Management encouraged growth and supported their staff.
good,typical day involved either reveiwing time and motion studies or compiling the data to prove a pay standard. other days were filled in preparing for these studies by designing work station layout and sewing equipment to support the various operations.
good,"Very fun place to work at with great discounts. You get to build consumer's trust, and learn a lot about how retail works if you are a beginner. After a while of working there, The Levi's team that you work with becomes a big family. And no other job will be the same as this one."
good,"Productive and fun workplace with pool and pin pong table"
good,"My time at Levi's was very enjoyable. Every team member worked very hard so you didn't have to pick up anyone's slack. The work can be quite intense and fast paced but also rewarding. The pay was very good for my age and I received discounts and uniform allowance. I particularly liked the management as it felt like they generally cared about your well-being. Overall a great company to work for, I wish I could've stayed longer as I was a Christmas Temp."
good,"Work lace is relax, you can come in wearing jeans, which is logical given they sell jeans. There is a lot of diversity, people are engaged in their work, and work/personal life balance is great."
good,This company is authentic like it's product. Has a great company culture. Their core vlaues are aligned with social justice and against inequality. No place is perfect and they have their problems too but I must say they are better than most other companies I have worked for.
good,"I worked for Levi's for almost a year and a half, had to leave due to relocation. The managers are all wonderful and want you to be happy in your position and the place itself. I progressed from Flex Pac to Cycle Count in about a year so they definitely want to promote from with in the company. As long as you do your work and mind your own business you'll do great and enjoy the place."
good,"Its an amazing environment working at Levi Strauss and Co. ( LSCO ). The management there were very nice and thorough, and helped me alongside the training and alongside any difficulties or problems I encountered. The only hardest part of the job would be during peak hours during the day/week you have to learn to handle going under pressure when more than one customer asks for help on a product or complains about a price or mischarge, it can take a couple shifts to finally get into LSCO ""Ecosystem"" but other than that everything was ok."
good,Ninguna gran empresa top en ventas seguir con el mismo impetud y fuerza a la marca

good,I worked as a tailor at Levi's. I helped customers with fittings and sewed alterations. The workplace was motivating with a friendly team.

good,"buen habiente laboral,buenos jefes trabajo en equipo,buenos bonos."
good,this was a great venture for me i got to work with one of my favorite clothing brands it was very relaxed and slow paced but an easy job i wouldnt want it any other way
good,I would come into work and greet all of my coworkers. Majority of us were close and became friends quickly. I learned how to resize clothing and my customer interactions sky rocketed. I learned to open up to people thanks to the encouragement from my managers. The hardest part of the job was telling customers that we didn't have a certain size in stock. I really enjoyed spending time with my coworkers and helping customers. Seeing them smile and leave happy made my day.
good,"A typical day was to release pick waves the first part of the day, then coordinate the packing floor personnel to packing work stations. "

good,Empresa con buenos valores y buen trato a los trabajadores.
good,"In all my years in retail, I have never worked for a company with such a love of human advancement and improvement, or a company that believes so strongly in its values. Levi Strauss & Co. is one of the few ""good guys"" left in the retail world. One of their core values is empathy and they really strive to provide for those in need or those less fortunate. They educate their employees on current world events and truly put themselves at the forefront of social injustice. Levi's is changing the world on employee at a time. I've become a more compassionate and empowered human in my short year and a half with the company. No other employers have had such a charitable and reputable history. From day one of our company's creation, they have always strived to provide a better life to all they can."
good,"Great environment, great customer service, good co-workers, the most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers get the right pair of jeans. I learned so much from this job."
good,It was always a joy working with my team on the sales floor.  I probably would have stayed there longer if I hadn't moved to Minnesota (From Connecticut).
good,good place to work. My territory was discontinued  so I  was laid off. It is more the city of which I live in as it is a smaller demographic and hard for clothing companies to justify Full time employees. It was a good working experience for me

good,Levi's is an amazing company. A typical day at work feels like you're spending a day with your family. Everyone cares about each other and everyone helps with the workload.
good,I have worked for a number of employers in the Retail Market place but never has any been as rewarding and support as Levi Strauss & Co. There is a reason that they are a number one employer and the best Jeans that one could ever own. I only left to try my luck in BC but am now returning to Alberta. I'd return to Levi Strauss & Co in a minute if there was something available at this time. If you work for them - STAY!!
good,I enjoyed having the opportinity to meet new customers from all over the world working at this store and learning about how the company started
good,This was the best part time job I had. It was fun dressing customers. I won one of the contest we had at work. Our job was to make sure the store stayed neat and clean.

good,"I love working for Levi's. You can tell the company truly cares about its employees and ensures they have a great quality of life. There's always volunteering events sponsored by the company and employees are encouraged to attend them. A typical work day consists of assisting customers, processing shipment, completing returns/exchanges, maintaining the appearance of the store, and enjoying the relaxed atmosphere with co-workers. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to bond with my co-workers. It's refreshing to be apart of a group that is interested in you and your life. The hardest part of the job can sometimes be assisting customers in finding the right fit in jeans. It's a bit of a challenge, but it's rewarding when you see how happy they are when they purchase them. The managers are great and are always willing to help you when needed."
good,This was my first job where i basically learned how to sell and cash handling. All my customer service i learned here as well. i stared as a normal sale associate and the move up to be a sales lead and work my way up as I continue.
good,"Excelente trabajo en equipo."
good,Really nice work environment. A day at work would consist of fixing jeans as well to help customers find the right sizes and style.
good,"I really liked this job, the 60+ man team were all great people, not a single problem the entirety of the time I was there. The company offers refrigerators, ping-pong tables, foos-ball tables, outside and inside seating (and the freedom to take breaks in your car), and a full Pepsi soda machine free to the employees to use at will. The hours were brutal, I worked 70 hours weekly, 10 hours every day 7 days a week. However; the pay was great, I brought home $700+ weekly (Paid every Friday) and benefits were included in being a full-time employee, dental, vision, and healthcare. I would recommend this job to someone in good healthy condition, and with the time on hand. I operated machinery (Pallet riders, RC Trucks, and Stock picker trucks) too which was perhaps the coolest part of it all, looks really good on a resume to boot!"
good,"Travail diversifié, et bonne dynamique de la Marque Levis."
good,"A typical day would be clock in, get your sales goal and have fun working with customers. I learned a lot of about having patience and nothing ever gets resolved with yelling and arguing. The customer is always right, remember that and you be alright. My coworkers were honestly the best people you will ever meet, they're just so much fun and are always happy. The hardest part of the job is probably not being able to help a customer with their shopping (if they are looking for a specific type of jeans of shirts and we don't care those jeans or shirts in our store anymore)"
good,"Llegaba y prendía mi computadora para revisar correos, ponía el café para mí todos mis compañeros."

good,"In August 2010 i started working for LS&Co in Reno, Nv as the SM. i instantly fell in love with the company and its passion to the communities its employees lived in. The heritage behind the brand is fenominal, consumers have such brand loyalty it can be overwhelming. In January 2012 i closed the Reno Nv Levi's location and moved to another brand where i grew the with the company and the store. Increasing its volume from a 2.5 mil to a 3.5 mil and developing internal talent to the next level. In July 2014 the RM & DM for LS&Co reached out to me to share that the brand would be opening a pop up outlet store in Sparks, Nv and they wanted me to be the SM of it. After much thought and consideration i decided to leave Tilly's and go back to a company that i had loved working for. In September 2014 i was apart of a team that had opened the first pop up outlet store in the company and its business thriving! We are one of five pop up stores in the company and we have the highest KPI's...but...the best is yet to come."

good,"Meus dias de trabalho são bem rotineiros, ligações e mais ligações, fazendo contatos novos, buscando saber as novidades em questão de preços dos concorrentes, discutindo internamente novas estratégias para atrair o cliente diariamente. Aprendi muito nessa área de vendas, até porque vim de uma área totalmente diferente. Aprendi desde sistemas operacionais relacionado à vendas, até como me comunicar melhor, expor melhor minhas ideias com um vocabulário mais rico, e estratégias de negociação. A gerência/direção é exemplar, sempre muito íntegra e justa em suas decisões, sempre consultando o quadro de funcionários a respeito das decisões na empresa. Quantos aos colegas, são profissionais excelentes, que desenvolvem muito bem suas tarefas diárias, procurando sempre manter o ambiente amigável. A parte mais difícil, sem dúvida, foi me adequar às vendas, já que meu histórico era de creche. Mas com o tempo, fui vendo como funciona, observando e praticando. A parte mais agradável é o reconhecimento na parte de metas alcançadas, sempre gratificadas, além do ambiente tranquilo, e o fato de a gerência nos dar o espaço para tirar dúvidas, reclamações e sugestões."

The hardest part about this job would have to be the money part. I know how to count but when you're dealing with large amounts of money you tend to either give and extra or short amount of change. It's a downer but you have to get used to it. My co-workers were all pretty mellow at first, you know, getting to know one another, but once they warmed up they are all nice people. I really enjoyed working here, especially the discounts."

We support each other, we help each other grow as people, we care for each other beyond just in the work place, we make sure that we work as a team and ensure that the job gets done. When I walk into work, I know I will have a good day regardless of the work load. The consumers that we get in our store are equally as amazing. I love helping individuals find their ""perfect jean"" because it not only makes them happy, but seeing them overjoyed to finally have a favorite pair of jeans, makes my day every time. Levi's also has a very interesting history and I love sharing my knowledge of it with consumers. One of my favorite things about this company is having consumers from all over the world, all walks of life, all cultures, come in to our store and have something in common with us as soon as they walk in; a love for our product."

good,"Levis Strauss & Co. was my first part time job. Since i was never involved in a business environment, i did not know what to expect when it came to the way customers and my fellow employees would treat me. within the first week, i felt that my effort was well appreciated by all members of the staff which motivated me to continue the hard work. throughout my 2 years of part time employment at Levis Strauss & Co. we have nearly achieved our monthly store goal set for us by corporate every month. Levis Strauss & Co. has treated me with extreme class and fairness."
good,"There are slow days especially Mondays, which I consider good because even if there's only one or two cashiers, they can clean the store which includes folding a re-sizing jeans during the shift. There are those few rushes but on busy days, if there is enough staff the store can be recovered during the shift and as well as once the store has closed. During the slower times of the year employees only come in 30 minutes before the store opens and stay only 30 after the store has closed, but during busy times of the year such as holidays you can stay for at least an hour after closing. "

Then flex out to sales floor to see if anyone needs help. Managers were the coolest i had except one. The hardest part of my job was to reach my sales goal. Because i was in fitting room, it wasnt a big profit, so i had to double my sales pitch and customer service just to hit my goal. I consistently started hitting the goal so my daily sales goal would raise because of what i usually do."

The co workers were great always doing what was best for the store.

The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting and helping new people find their style everyday."
