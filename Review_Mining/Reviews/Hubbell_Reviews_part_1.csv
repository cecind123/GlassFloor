rating,review
bad,"If I could give it 0 stars I would. Nothing but a money hungry corporation who couldn't care less about their employees. They are expected to show up to work even in treacherous road conditions. All they care about is the bottom line at the end of the month. The compensation is horrible. Supposedly ""matches all other companies in the area"". Not true. People who have left have gotten the same position but paying substantially more. Management is horrible and does not know how to communicate. The only good thing about this place are the coworkers. Non management co workers. There is a visible divide between salary and non salaried employees. Favorites are chosen and those are the ones that succeed. No room for advancement unless you get a degree. They have already had 2 major lay offs since acquiring the company in 2015. They will close doors soon for good."
bad,In Lenoir City If you enjoy working 60+hours a week when promised 40 then Hubbell is for you. If you enjoy being bullied by supervisors and  lame Human Resources dept then definitely go to them. If you hate being at home and seeing your family come on down. Plus forget being able to take time off for any reason the point system will take care of you fast. Wages are a joke for the amount of work they pressure you to do
bad,Very stressful place to work with hard deadlines to be met.  No one seemed to know what the right procedures were to follow which makes it hard when someone is learning
bad,"The whole place is one big joke. The plant manager and the ""production manager/ quality manager/hunting buddy "" make all the decisions because they have a personal relationship.  The union is a joke and is just as bad as they are because they are afraid to stand up to them. They let the ""production manager"" over fab and quality harrass, bully, and humiliate people because he feels threatened when someone is not afraid of him."
bad,Managers were very inconsistent and uneducated on company standard operating procedures.  Each manager would give a different answer to the same question asked.  Managers were friends with some members of the staff and often got involved in personal and unprofessional conversations about other staff members.  Very much in need of a training program.
bad,"Hubbell is a dirty job. Once you walk in the door, the dust and fumes you breathe in will deteriorate your health. The casting position will tear you apart from the insides. 10 hour days and mandatory 20 hours of overtime. If you don't speak Spanish, forget it. If you're over weight, you can drive the forklift around in a disorganized mess of a yard, bouncing loads off uneven cement filled with potholes. Any information obtained by management will be used against you in ridicule. If you have a smile on your face, they will work you til it falls off. Two 15 min breaks and a 30 min lunch isn't enough time to relax from the work load. Try some dusty food from the break room 'store'. If you work in the office doing paperwork, only if you're lucky, you'll be expected to multitask until 'the wheels fall off the bus'. There are some real brown nosers that work there and can make your 60 hours unbearable. Two faced management that ask how they can help and the next day you're canned for 'preformance and attitude'. The men that work for Hubbell are cheating pigs, so don't be a girl. Hubbell is also based in Mexico."
bad,No communication with anybody that works there.  It's a disaster!  I would not be able to recommend this company to anybody without throwing up a bit in my mouth.
bad,Get worked like a mule. Do a lot of work with no appreciation because it all goes to lead scheduler.  LS does nothing except sit at desk and play on phone. Only still here because need insurance
bad,"Worst place to work. Feels like prison. Supervisors lie and you always need to watch your back. If you are a temp be aware that management will use you for three months and drop you... making any excuse they can."
bad,Expected much out of you for the amount you were paid. Scheduling was horrible and got called in mandatory on days off. Work conditions were hot and extremely uncomfortable. Don't recommend this job to anyone who can't handle heavy physical labor.
bad,"Hubbell is a racist place to work. If a black man or woman speak up for there self, they will make something up on you and fire you. There are no black managment on the plant floor at all, and for a company that be big that is ridiculous. The company only thinks about profits. Management gets quarterly bonuses for doing nothing while the floor workers gets nothing and we do all the work."
bad,I worked and was an officer of the company {RFL} prior to being acquired by Hubbell and was asked to remain during the transition.  It was immediately apparent the the reason for their want for me to stay was simply insurance and that they did not consider my retention permanent.
bad,"Management changed and it went down hill from there.  You rarely saw upper management and when I was told I was being let go, it was done via telephone conversation from a person I am told was manager but never had he bothered to introduce himself to me.  Should have known then that job was in jeopardy."
bad,Upper management is only concerned with themselves.  Below Director positions should only be treated as temporary.  Its not what you know but who u know.  Its sad to see people getting a director title b/c they know someone in upper management.
bad,"The interview with HR went great but the majority of things they said were false."
bad,"The company has poor management in aiken, there is no vision or drive for the long haul. The priorities and projects change daily and the operation is essentially run by the village idiot."
bad,"I would definitely not recommend Hubbell - Wiegmann for a place of employment.  I worked there for 23 years, and recently left there on my own accord. You will be working 6 days a week if you're a union employee.  You never know from day to day if you're working 10 hours, or 9 1/2, or 9, or 8 1/2, or 8, or less than 8. They're very good for telling people within the last 15 to 30 minutes of the day that the employees need to stay over on their shift. Factory work is more stressful than you would think. The company employees tell the union workers to send out a product, knowing full well that said product isn't up tp quality standards.  So the product gets returned and employees get their butt chewed for sending out poor quality work, when it was a company person who made them send it out in the first place. They don't keep their employees well equipped with the proper tools and supplies that are needed to finish a work order. Constantly running out of supplies! It's extremely hot in the summer, and they only supply workers with bags of ice because the two ice machines they have cannot keep up with the two hundred employees. And you only get the ice if the outside temperature is 95 degrees by a certain time of day. If it only hits 94 degrees,  you're on your own. Not to mention the fact that it's approximately 10 degrees higher in the plant than it is outside during the summer due to all of the ovens. If you're really desperate for a job, it's better than nothing.  Or if you want to work your way up the ladder by kissing butt, then it could be the place for you."
bad,This was absolutely the worst job I have ever had. The management at this place treats their employees awful. They only care about how much work they can get out of the employees. They don't talk to the employee's with respect. You are just a number at Hubbell Power Systems.
bad,I was harassed most of the day by my supervisor about going to the restroom. I learned to keep my mouth closed because at the end of the day the employee was always wrong when it came to Hubbell. I had amazing coworkers who kept me smiling regardless to what I was going through there. the hardest part of the job was dealing with management. the most enjoyable was meeting some great coworkers whom I miss so much
bad,"Unsafe work environment, Managers want you to work 80 hours a week without breaks."
bad,"Supervisor had difficulty remembering aspects of his job."
bad,"A typical day at Hubbell Power Systems was like being at daycare, you were constantly watched like a little kid. I learned only how to grind excess metal off of product,and how to change the belt on a vertical grinder.Management was ok ,but could be better. Co-Workers were good a lot of team work.Constantly being watched was the hardest part,we are adults. Overall the most enjoyable part of the job was the team work"
bad,That place isn’t a good place unless you just don’t care about being taken advantage of .Nothing good to say about the place I’ve seen them fire people that are about to retire just so they can bring someone in making less. It’s all about money to corporate they don’t care about the workers .  the HR lady is the worst one she has fired so many people .Big turnover rate because it’s cheaper to keep bringing in new people
bad,"Litecontrol was not a bad place to work under the previous Plant Manager. Fast paced, most months, we as a team would achieve and surpass goals. The new egotistical Plant Manger belittles everyone. Forces Supervisors to write up employees by saying “ You can do what you want but it doesn’t look good to corporate “.  I cannot fathom how many write ups has happened under his tenure."
bad,Not a good company.  Constant conflicts with upper management and disgraceful treatment of the manufacturing personnel. Very poor work life balance including forced 6 day work weeks and 10-12 hour work days due to workload demands.
bad,They work their employees 26 days straight with only two days off then work u another 26 days straight. They have no understanding of letting someone build up to their rates. They make their employees feel like a piece of trash. They try to cover up the way the work. They don’t give their employees a descent breaks and they say you can’t go anywhere for your lunch which is only twenty minutes. They say they give heat breaks but they don’t do that either. Don’t waste your time with this company.
bad,"They say they hire from within, but even with the experience, they hire who they want.  Hubbell management is not run well.  One man determines what is done, even tho that is denied.  Employees are not treated well."
bad,"Hubbells chain of command, in the management field , and communications , where that of  a joke. Everyone wanted to be in charge, but no one wanted to take charge. Lots of finger pointing."
bad,Warning!!! Don’t work here unless you want to work under the worst management possible. Management is two-faced and talk about other employees  behind their backs. No work life balance whatsoever. People are over-worked and not appreciated. If I could give a negative star rating I would. Look elsewhere if you want to remain sane!
bad,"Do not work at Hubbell.  The work to life balance is non existent, employees are not given any respect (if you want respect you better be willing to kiss some booty) and with that said, promotions are treated the same way.  If you aren't in the ""club"", you will never get anywhere within the company.  The company used to actually care about their employees but now jobs are being either shipped out to India or they are forcing employees to relocate to Greenville, South Carolina to keep their job.  Management is also clueless."
bad,"I worked here for a couple of months before leaving. The environment was horrible. It was cliquey and I would get blamed for things I didn't do (there was poor communication, yet I would still get blamed for it)."
bad,"I would think twice before working for this company.  Every time the stock price drops, the company begins another round of layoffs.  Every October 1st was viewed as a time to begin layoffs in the office and then moving into the factory for additional layoffs.  This is a cutthroat company that only has the bottom line in sight.  I worked there the first 5 years as a regular employee, got caught up in an October round of layoffs and was called back as a contractor over a year later, only to be terminated once again in a January 2nd round of ""we are not renewing any contracts for our own contractors""."
bad,"Was not a good working that promoted team work or safety. There was no willingness to help employees in or outside work. This company only worried about how much they spent and made, and did everything possible to save money even when safety was involved."
bad,"Not a great place to work for . Supervisor and management are not well run. A new worker can figure that out. This company doesn't care about their workers. If you are looking for a long career in this place, look somewhere else. A new person will get laid off quick, when it starts getting slow. Which is around november. I don't know how the real owner, doesn't fire the whole management and hr team. I don't know how this place makes money, their so disorganized. They don't listen to nobodies ideas,to better the company."
bad,No Collaboration or TEAM Work. Hard to get visibily. Department staff didn't even sit together. You don't know what the person next to you does.
bad,I started in the main building te lights which weren't too bad. But I was shortly promoted to the pole shop and that when things turned for the worse. I was injured on the job due to another employee a handful of times and also they refused to provide proper PPO. after the obvious mistake that the employee made I noticed an immediate x on my back because management didn't get their bonuses.. they quickly tried everything under the book try to fire me and failed and ended up having OSHA fine them a lot of money and I just quit and went back to school. DO NOT WORK HERE...
bad,Management treats employees like dogs. You  will get screamed at in front of everyone for speaking to  other  employees even if it is a job related question. You work 6 days a week (they dont tell you this on hiring) so no family life at all. If you get hurt or sick forget it. They only care about the numbers and daily you are compared to  the boss's favorite as if you are nothing!!!!
bad,"extremely poor management.  factory employees are treated very poorly, as well as Manufacturing Supervisors.  Management is very disrespectful and unappreciative of the work and effort of its employees."
bad,"I can't think of a good reason to work here.  There are Layoffs, Management is horrible.  Dirty and old place to work.  Watch your back.  Pay is ok.  Promotion comes to those who work 70+ hours a week uncompensated."
bad,"Co-workers are great to work with. Management will push you until you break, scheduled Saturdays, unwilling to fix payroll issues that are over 6 months old, make you run machines that you were not hired to run so the company can save a dollar. If you shut a machine down because it has an issue with the program you are told to run it anyway but pay more attention to it, even though the program changes while it is running. You also have to remember to keep your other machines running or risk getting yelled at by a supervisor who cares about making product not quality product."
bad,"Since Hubbell has taken over the company I worked for, for 18 years never have I seen such bad management like we have now. They threaten you. They have no regards about you or your family. What was once a good company to work for now has a bunch of unhappy employees do to the fact of how they are treated and talked down to. Never have I been threatened by a employer in all my life till now. They don't care about your safety either. I could not recommend this job to anyone unless you enjoy being abused on a daily basis."
bad,"Need better management very racist and discriminated against young black men,need to have more younger black guys hired they have nothing but old white guys and Mexicans who work there and that is discrimination."
bad,"The company was already in disarray before they were purchased, then it was organized by a person that hadnt been in the field fresh out of college, the processes that made a company with a 3 day order to customer turn around, become a may take weeks to complete and might be in tolerance if we are lucky. The machines are old and proprietary, management is looking to have people operate more than one machine at a time, they eliminated sick time, refuse to have a written hand book, have a progressive punishment system that at this time doesn't forgive doctors notes."
bad,"Management treats hourly employees like 2nd class citizens. There is  no support for an hourly employee from the plant manager. There is aggressive management, micro managing, threats of termination, and verbal aggression from Supervisors. The managers/supervisors attitude is ""Do as i say, not as i do"". There is very low moral at the Rocky Mount plant but there are a lot of employees there that are working to support their families and can t afford to leave but feel they will get no help or support from upper management or human resources. They will ALWAYS side with manager/supervisor. An hourly employee doesn't stand a chance at the Rocky Mount plant."
bad,"HORRID! The place smelled bad, looked bad, was ran bad by the heads, the work was to much on us, and 90% of the people working there aren't legal to work in the USA. They have uncerted individuals operating Fork Lifts and Machines. "
bad,Employees are treated as slaves. There is no praise of hard work and effort but they are very quick to punish you for even having a cough drop in your work area. Management is a complete mess!!
bad,"this place was not an overall good place to work,and under poor/bad management."
bad,I wouldn't recommend anyone to work there because management doesn't care about you or anything and they’re very unorganized and very unprofessional and will fire you for no reason
bad,"If Management doesn't like you they will talk to you as if you're stupid, they talk to other employees and call you lazy or ignorant. They literally make you want to quit everyday until you finally do. Then once you do they laugh at you. There is no room for advancement within the company, I am a certified welder and 5 years out of school and they wouldn't even acknowledge me when I applied for a salary role."
bad,Cut throat for anyone who does not rub elbows with supervisors. If someone above simply dont like you they make it a vendetta to get you in trouble. Even if you didn't start a argument with them but simply asking for someone above you will lead to being suspended. Recorded a entire argument that a salary stand in supervisor started a argument. Refused to do his job. I was the one that got the axe. He started it over a something outside of work and carried it into work place. Then I was suspended pending investigation. Then one day before I roll over to union I was cut for verbal altercation. I actually have proof I said nothing to cause fight with witnesses and recording. I was axed. Only because he was salary and rubbed elbows with upper management. Also no second shift supervisor so you get stuck with this guy who creates vendettas.
bad,"Not a great place to work. Lots of empty promises with nothing every coming of it. I had an interview, 8 weeks ago, and I still have not heard a decision. When I asked HR, she called me impatient."
bad,Don't work for this company unless you have no other choice. This place is so slowpaced. They bring in temps to increase the workload but they rarely have jobs for you to do. The people who work here are all two faced and will throw the blame your way. Training is very slow and honestly a lot of people here have bad attitudes to begin with. The attendance policy here is atrocious. Also you get paid every two weeks after you're hired. The winsted company works with a staffing agency that requires a long drive out of town and honestly is one of the worst agencies I've ever worked with. Do not work for this company.
bad,"I worked at Burndy LLC  5+ years in Littleton, NH. I can say pay and compensation are ok. However, that being said this is the most poorly managed company I have every worked for The supervisors wander around advising you on how to do your job, and they don't have the a clue on how your machine operates, but they will not listen to someone who has been doing the job and running this machine for years. Your input doesn't matter. They want numbers not quality."
bad,"Worked many hours on and off the clock. Unappreciated by Management. Corporations have a way of ""weeding"" out those they no longer want. Culture does not promote positive work environment."
bad,You’re never off. They will cheat you as often as possible. If you’re hurt you’ll end up fighting to get your medical bills paid and they’ll find a reason to fire you. It’s stupid hot during the summer. People falling out in the floor hot. Training is a joke and they expect you to be a pro the next week. Don’t believe them when they say you’ve got three months to get your numbers up. There is a reason they’re always hiring.
bad,"This is a terrible place to work.  Overtime is usually good, but the leadership is very poor. The manufacturing supervisors mention their monthly bonuses on a daily basis. Bad management from the top level all the way down.  Poor morale and terrible culture."
bad,"Leadership is non-existent.   Employee turnover is unbelievable leaving many roles unfilled.   "
bad,"I worked in the assembly department (Viper line) for less than a month.  The training I received in the short time I was there was often incomplete or incorrect and (surprise!) guess who got blamed for the mistakes. Very much a dog eat dog, back stabbing culture.  One of my coworkers in particular seem to really enjoy pointing out what she perceived to be my errors to the rest of the line (even after, in one instance, the person responsible for incorrectly training me accepted responsibility for the mistake).  You rarely saw supervision except when they were passing through the department and they seemed more interested in joking around than actually supervising.  The job paid well for this area but didn't require a lot of intelligence.  If you want a job that actually requires you to think Hubbell is probably not the place for you.  One final thought: this is a union shop, which means you work with a lot of whiners and complainers."
bad,"Worked for this company for 8 days."
bad,"I worked there for 11 and 1/2 years. I would have left many years before but the pay and benefits where better than anywhere else I could find. Employees are not valued. ""Lean"" factory that overworks its employees and loves to cut positions regardless of the extra work dumped on surviving staff. Constant turnover."
bad,"horrible upper management - no communication and the union runs the show. might as well not have middle management and just let union be the managers of the department. when an employee can run to the union and not talk to the manager at all - why waste money on a manager. "
bad,"Poor management "
bad,No team work or respect for Co-workers. Staff focused on numbers not working conditions or quality of shipment. Lack of communication from shift supervisor to employees.
bad,"I can completely see why this company cannot keep employees! I overheard the supervisor on 2nd shift calling another employee a very derogatory name to another supervisor.  I couldn't believe it, this was a level of unprofessionalism I had never seen! He was only on the floor until the warehouse manager left for the day and would even tell his people that the manager was still there and to look busy.  After he left, the supervisor would stay in his office all night and couldn't care less what went on, always an excuse why he couldn't do anything.  No enforcement of the rules whatsoever....there were people on cell phones, people leaving without clocking out, leads going outside to smoke, it was a complete joke. Work was not hard, decent pay for what you did and certainly not much was expected of you."
bad,"I gave this job a one rating only because there is no lesser option.  Employees leave for break five or ten minutes early and come back five or ten minutes late. They leave for lunch without punching out, are not supposed to have cell phones but are on them constantly in the aisles. People are talking in the aisles constantly and will not move if you need by.  The supervisors on 2nd shift are made aware of these things and want no part of hearing it.  They make you feel like you're the bad person for saying something.  As long as you simply show up, you will have a job no matter how bad of a worker. I was not used to such lame management and had to leave."
bad,too much going on for the size of the plant not enough space for anything. Management does not have a clue of what it takes to do your job and they don't really care. Very hot in the summer and cold in the winter
bad,"Management lacked communication. "
bad,"Terrible finance organization.  Poor communication, executive management does not have leadership skills or behaviors"
bad,Great place to work. I would recommend the company to anyone. Good benefits good pay. I only look elsewhere to keep options open. I still work there and plan on staying there.
bad,The job support from yr supervisor is bad lack of leadership.and they treat you unfairly. It's and hours are cut around hoilday s.they treat each person differently. Supervisor made job hard.
bad,They are not all about the people within their facility. You can express to them ongoing issues within the company and by you following the chain of command and it still doesn’t matter.  You can tell them About their safety issues and they look the other way. Experienced employees never get a chance to move up or better pay if you’re willing to grow and expand your knowledge and be asset to the company it’s not for you.
bad,60 hr and every saturday  only one day off and many people is tired but they work because of the paper they give you to sign when you are getting hire
bad,"For production it is surprisingly a very slow pace job with long hours. You can forget about any kind of home life. Management is not very good. They would rather ignore problems than fix it. Pay raise is nearly impossible except maybe a couple of cents each year while they ask more and more of their employees. Very hard to move up in company, they rather hire from the outside instead of promoting employees that have been there for years and already know the job. It's not worth all the hours and lack of pay."
bad,"Employees are treated like a puppet on a string, not allowed to have their own personal opinions, some days not enough work on the floor for employees, if you had vacation time, you could use that for ""Lack of work"" workers are at stand up jobs only, sometimes unbearable heat and not allowed to have water at workstations. Folks with seniority talked to and treated ""Temps as nobodies"" Senior people have also been known to physically push,spit and reprimand as well as,refuse to properly train other workers as if they were  less desirable. Lead people post things on Facebook that is demeaning and cruel about what goes on inside the facility.  "
bad,Good people work  around you at times is very hot it is a Foundry the heat will make you tired but God give me strength to do better and to do the best I like to train people and teach people how to do their job correctly
bad,"I left a long term job i had been at for 10 years to go to Hubbell, it was the biggest mistake I've ever made. Hr system is absolutely horrible. Management seems to have no clue what's going on. Their are way too many chiefs out on the floor in this company. If you bring up any concerns to management you are just wasting your breath. I completely regret it.  Only plus was decent pay. Insurance is not good."
bad,"Good people, Bad management. They fire people for anything, and allow people that don't work too have the most success.  The hard workers are frowned upon."
bad,Their point system is designed for failure.  No matter what your excuse is that's a point. They don't understand that you have a life outside of work.
bad,Favoritism is huge discrimination big time certain dept all ran by family supervisors lack common knowledge people are ok if ur from there area pay is low two diff pay for same job
bad,"Poor management  break corporate and OSHA rules all the time. Cheat to win mentality. Good old boys club where only they benefit. Everyone is out for themselves. All employees are paid the same only supervisors and management make living wage. Only way to get ahead is to suck up to management hard work goes unrecognized. Temps get paid weekly while permanent employees get paid every two weeks. Temps make more than perms. Nothing happens to rule breakers in fact the are rewarded for their treachery. Management tries to intimidate when they are in the wrong, to get their way. Love to advance people of a certain race they usually get fast tracked."
bad,"busy work environment, a lot pressure to make sales numbers every month, it is all that matters to management. Poor planning from upper management who don't understand the business."
bad,"Working in a non climate controlled facility. Can be extremely hot in summer and really cold in winter. Work is terrible as exposed to harmful chemicals. Breathing in harmful chemicals and dust all day. Pay is decent, but the work is extremely exhausting and can be dangerous."
bad,"Lazy supervision that will allow the department to get behind, example if someone is off he will sit in the office and watch you get behind rather than chip in. Upper management is clueless and could care less about the employee other than implementing ways to get rid of you and bring in someone new."
bad,"If you are a white man then you might do good here if you can get in the click.  Also, if you are a person that can figure things out then you will do well here because no one trains you on anything.  You will have to learn by trail and error and hopes that you don't get fired during this phase. This company harbors a ""Every man for himself"" culture so don't be surprised when someone throws you under the bus."
bad,terrible place to work.If you want to work in a unsafe placed go for it.Ceo sucks and does not care about his employees.But to work you till you drop or have a heart attack.
bad,Like any other company this company has it's ups and downs. My experience was not the best but this may be an excellent place for someone else. I was not impressed with the culture. It was very toxic and employees were treated with disregard.
bad,"Poor and indecisive management in lighting division. Particular manager (VP Engineering) is notorious for blaming everyone but himself for poor results.  He failed as director of quality, yet manages to be promoted when actual good employees with ability to improve the company are fired. They put diversity hires ahead of talent in most cases. Good for those that are OK with status quo and able to tolerant incompetence. Best executives left in 2019."
bad,"I was hired through an agency and in 6 months i was hired by the company. SAME PAY. Basic benefits overall it was good. New Supervisor/manager was hired 2 months after the old supervisor was let go. The new guy has no clue what he got into. Guy was constantly lying, did not know how the product was made or how it was being tested or shipped.  The ""cell"" that i was working in did not need any type of supervising;  the 3 of us were handling a 6 person job load and meeting deadlines on time. After all that nightmare i am glad it is over i would not recommend this place as a permanent position."
bad,"The job is not hard and management does not watch over your shoulder if you produce results, however I don't trust the company to be fair to its employees. I have been there 5 years and I have seen 3 lay-offs for no other reason than to keep the shareholders happy."
bad,"you have one break a day, don't know what time your shift ends, always never know if your on day shift or night shift. always wanting you to do more with no thanks"
bad,Hubbell Power Systems in Leeds Al is not a great place to work. I have worked for this company for 14 years and I regret every year I gave them. Management doesn't appreciate the job that the employees do. They give us no kind of bonuses for doing a good job. For Christmas they give a very low bonus not even enough for a full tank of gas. This place is miserable. If you're out there and looking for a job I wouldn't recommend Hubbell Power Systems in Leeds.
bad,"I have almost 5 years in servitude and while I have been allowed the great experience of moving around on the floor learning new things, any attempt to climb higher then laborer is met with crushing blows of disausion from every level of the management team."
bad,One of the worse experiences in my professional career. Immediate supervisor was a micro manager who was scared of his boss and wouldn't leave me/other sales reps alone. Very unprofessional atmosphere.
bad,Management treat employees like slave.  It feels like you are working on a 3rd country sweat factory.  I do not recommend this place.
bad,"Too many chiefs, not enough Indians! Will tell you at the last minute that you have to work on Saturday. They do not care about your personal life. Management is horrible! Not enough pay for equipment operators!"
bad,"Corporate ruined everything, laid off 2/3s off the employees, wanted 3 times the work as before."
bad,Many stressful issues and managers covering themselves so as not to get in trouble. New CEO not listening to advice from managers that know what is happening down the line. Outsourcing of accounting functions is causing backlash of issues that have been problems to resolve.
bad,"When I started, it was a nice place to work. Then there was a shake-up in management approx 6-8 months before they laid me off. Terrible management and cut throat tactics. We were two divisions that they tried to make one. Did not work. Retribution and firings followed."
bad,"As far as culture is concerned, there really isn't one. You are there to work, and go home. While every day isn't terrible, there are certain aspects that, in my opinion, dehumanize people. The environment is extremely hot/cold depending on the season, and you are expected to work 8-11 hours on average in these conditions. Your breaks are limited and short. Any time away from workstations is highly scrutinized (even for restroom visits)."
bad,Management sucks they make you work overtime on Saturday at the last minute. They are always right and you'll always be wrong. If you dont kiss a** and or a work snitch you wont last.
bad,A lot of work and very little training in a very short amount of time. Unreasonable expectations. Clicks work there! Favorites are made known around there.
bad,"As a remote manufacturing site to the corporate offices, all focus is on production and not the people or work environment. Shifting priorities and lack of focus."
bad,I learn how to drive a forklift how to work a saw and how to use grinding wheel. It was a hard place to work were it was no good leader ship. I use it for a steeping stone
bad,monday to thursday 6.30 til 4.30. ok management. wasnt allowed to progress to the next stage in the job. plenty of breaks. best part of the job meetimg new people
bad,"was lead person putting parts together, painting parts to hang on the line to be packed out. Also was a lab tech mixing chemicals for cleaning parts to be pact out"
bad,"empresa onde não se da oportunidades aqueles que buscam crescimento pessoal e profissional, alta rotatividade"
bad,"I didn't like this job pay sucks for,the work you have to do management sucks I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else wouldn't go back xjdjjdjfnfnfxxcdcx"
bad,"If you are doing research on how it was to work in a factory in the early twentieth century, this is the place to work. The Centralia, MO plant is working out of a one hundred year old building in which not much has been done to udate it. There is little to no air circulation and no exhaust fans. Be prepared to blow black stuff out of your sinuses all weekend long. You get one ten minute break and a thirty minute lunch. (This might be better than back in the day) For the most part this is back breaking labor. There will be days when you personnally will move 8 tons of steel by hand. This is not so bad but considering that if it is 90 degrees outside, it is over one hundred inside. There are work stations that have had temperatures above 130 degrees. They do have antiquated fans at each station that blow hot air at you, if that is any relief. You don't even get much of that since you are in constant motion. Several employees have passed out, yet nothing has been done. It is nice on break when you can walk out into ninety degree weather to cool down. If you start in June, be prepared that you will not get a vacation or sick day for a year and a half. Then it is only 5 vacation days. "
bad,"If you only want to be told what to do and not think for yourself then this place may work for you as long as you don't like to ask questions either."
bad,"Hubbell is unorganized, inefficient and all about production, preaching lean w/o sustainability. No work life balance and has zero compassion. You are told to keep your head down and mouth shut. Poor communication and consistency.  Management is out of touch with reality. HR is missing the Human in Human Resources. Pay is good but not worth wasting your time if you take pride, work hard or believe in quality. Engineers have God complexes. The union and union president is a joke"
bad,Management seems completely clueless most of the time. There are unachievable goals because almost everything is made to order but its frowned upon to not make them. Some of the equipment is highly outdated and breaks down on a weekly basis. If you're looking for high pay (for the area) this is the place for you. As long as you can deal with the constant headache.
bad,"It was a good place to work, until Hubbell bought it."
bad,"Unfortunately, this plant only harbors a CUT-Throat culture.  If you are white and a man you will go far here.  You never know when they will get rid of you without explanation.  There is no training set up for anyone new coming in.  You are basically thrown to the wolves and expected to do your job. They choose to keep their cheapest employees so that upper management will receive more of an bonus because they save on labor cost. If you are thinking about working here, save yourself the headache and move on."
bad,"I worked at Hubbell burndy nearly ten years. Tried everything to advance, produced in the top 2 for years. Pulling teeth for a raise, everybody got systematic raises even those who did 1/3 the workload. Harassed, put down, embarrassed (everyone) daily by alcoholic manager with small man complex. Management was clueless, discriminatory, petty and did not take the most logical of ideas from employees. Hurt my back severely and was out of work and they tried to fire me. How they received a ""best place to work"" award is beyond me."
bad,"This company is the typical giant corporation. There are certain to be parts of the company that are pleasant to work in, but the bureaucracy in my office hinders all progress and every employee has little to no motivation to work outside of continuing to receive a pay check."
bad,work is pretty stead all year around. multiple different jobs that you can do. they go by seniorit. management is pretty poor and so is the engineering department
bad,"This company is Newtown favores people too much. Shady employees and supervisors. Bad holiday gifts. Management is ran very poorly. They don't really care about the workers you have to buy your own tools if needed, clippers to cut plastic. Also no sick time. Point system that no matter what you do. Counts against you. Old bathrooms need to be remodel."
bad,"It is an extremely stressful unorganized environment. Management is very unprofessional. They don't know if they want to be your friend,supervisor,or lover. The max out pay is ridiculous.16.35-.40, when there are other surrounding plants in the area who offer that as an entry level pay. There isn't much room for growth if you are an African American. Even if you are an African American that meets all the requirements as far as Degrees, work experience, etc. I would not recommend this place to   anyone."
bad,Positive relationships with co-workers and subordinates. Upper management not supportive of workers and lacking in positive role models.
good,"Hubbell is a lighting plant, very cool place to work when the drama is not around great pay if youbcan deal with drama. Other then that great hours you work monday through saturday 60hours a week. 6saturdays straight then off 1 saturday then 6again awsome hours to get great pay so overtime is always available."
good,"I felt let down by the new management team. They hired managers that is not suited for the job. I was let go without paying my vacation, I still have 8 vacation days left. I am still thinking about suing Hubbell for my vacation pay and age discrimination. "
good,I've had a hard time working here. There is no room for advancement and there is a lot of favoritism shown for certain employees. I have expressed my grievances but they have not been acknowledged.
good,I learned a lot working with Hubbell. They will let you do a great bit. They don't really spend the time to teach you anything. It is a great way to get your feet wet. You also are not going to advance and they have a ton of lay offs.
good,To have more time with my family. Working second shift takes away all of my afternoon time never get to see my kids or attend any of their functions after school
good,"terrible temperatures,nothing good to say except benefits.no life,66hours per week.most employees were non helpful,stressful to anyone who was trying to achieve."
good,"A normal day is hot and messy,fast and stressful.My co-workers on the other hand are helpful and team oriented.the hardest part of my job is the heat and the consecutive days in a row.The best part of my job is definitely my co-workers"
good,Not exactly the greatest place in the world to work but not exactly the worst place either. Everything is based upon seniority so you could be the best person for the job and just because someone’s been there one day longer than you they’re going to get it. The union is a joke they’re not out for your best interest to the president is just a typical yes person yes to this yesterday yes to whatever they want to duty you and she really doesn’t do much to help you.
good,Continuous work for 40 - 60 hours a week and very little compensation. Management wasn't friendly at all. Work environment was like I joined the U.S Marines.
good,Working there for 14yrs alot has changed. The people there needs opportunities to move up. With the work experiences that we have. We have to beg for it
good,Needs better management. The work was pretty interesting but it was fairly easy to do. It's ok job. Just needs to be managed better. With more benefits. & Different products
good,"Upper management always looking to second-guess and undercut department supervisors. Work schedule typically includes weekends and holidays. There are no sick days, even for management."
good,"Nos esforzamos por cumplir al 100% en cumplir con el cliente a pesar de las áreas de oportunidad que tenemos en la mayoría de las áreas."
good,Job only provides enough to pay your bills. Management doesn't listen to the employees who does the job everyday. Not the best job . Could increase pay for employers whose been with them for at least 10 years or more. After 2 years new employees makes the same as the older employees.
good,Very detailed job. Learned to deal with many emails daily and lots of paperwork
good,"The people I worked with were great but management sucked.  Knee jerk decisions were commonplace.  For example, top management always made lofty goals for the next year without any inpout from the rank and file.  When the ist quarter started out slower than anticipated then attrition measures were quickly enacted, up to and including layoffs.  The WORST management ever!!"
good,"Hubbell is a fast paced manufacturing facility.  Expectations are high.  Workers are not consistently shown respect, and workers do not consistently show managers respect.  Training overall could improve.  "
good,A lot of over paid engineers and supervisors that have no clue if it wasn't for the older people working there the doors would probably close..They take no pride in there products just worried about numbers..It's a shame it use to be a good place to work
good,Es una empresa muy estable debido al producto que maneja y prestaciones promedio sin embargo no existe mucha oportunidad de crecimiento profesional
good,No work life balance if you're on the production side of the facility. Expected to drop everything and come in if needed on your days off.
good,Every day had to reconnect the closed loops recycling systems. I learned how to interact with vendors. Management did not have the will to implement discipline to the workers. The vast majority of my co-workers wanted to do the least amount of work possible. The most difficult part of my job was dealing with un-disciplined and ungrateful employees.
good,Learned a lot about electrical components.  The fact that it was very close to home was a great bonus.
good,People were ok job was easy very hot and dirty the benefits and pay were amazing very close to my house i enjoyed the worked i did there didnt like the cool air hood
good,"You'd think that would be a good thing but if u are a hard worker and have employee's standing around watching u work and supervisor is a pansy, it really stinks.  Almost forces you to join the losers.  Then when a stand around finally makes management mad enough to fire, the union will take it all the way to arbitrator for a bad worker.  Everytime. Union is scared to get sued by employee's b/c its happened before.  Supervisors are overworked.  H.R. is non existent, supes have to do all H.R. for each of their employees.  I had 24 under my charge and it was the fastest paced, crazy struggle to get everything done and keep team motivated.  Then I was fired for upsetting a female worker by making her work.  She went to HR with a lie and thats all it takes.  If u cant prove otherwise that something didnt happen and the person is a good actor and convincing, you're toast."
good,Regularly given mandatory overtime hours before the end of the day. Huge lack of communication between front end engineering staff and operators. Problems were regularly placed on operators to solve or fix. Management staff was inconsistent and not held to the same standards of work or training.
good,Was a good place to work with competitive salaries. Climate and culture has changed recently making it more difficult to work there. It might still be good for entry level positions.
good,"Good old boys club.  If you don't fit the mold you will not advance within the company.  Very limited chance for advancement.  401k, vision, dental, health"
good,"Hubbell is a good company to work for, good people and good environment.  Work load is typical for the job. Biggest complaint was that it was hard to get things done because of the process."
good,"Show up at 6am get started with work an work at a decent speed to get the product out but, safety first. Biggest issues with majority of the employees were wit management looking for any small reason to fire employees that were make over 40k so that they could hire new employees only topping out at 16 dollars per hr. It was very stressful employees were very afraid to tell management when mistakes or injuries were made do to a new zero tollerance policy that came along once the company sign a new contract"
good,"The work was long and the management was old school"
good,"Responsible for receiving,stocking,handling,inventory and all other distribution activities."
good,This is a very easy job to work at. The job is very easy and east going.  The hourly pay is fine . Currently making 15$ . Not enough over time . Schedule time not good either .
good,They did me wrong I was out sick brought note back as stated came back position was filed told me to fill out another app. Very unprofessional other than that a beast job supervisions dont Know their jobs
good,"Hubbell is a stable company with lots of opportunity if you are willing to relocate. They are a behind on the times and do not have a very good work life balance. There is limited opportunity to work remote or flex schedules. Some positions work 8 to 5 while others work long extensive hours. They promote diversity while their leadership team is all white male which does not give a good message. There are a lots of politics and red tape. It's hard to do your job efficiently when so many hands are involved in even the smallest decisions. If you like to be micro managed and criticized for things out of your control, Hubbell is  the place to be. They do pay well. Benefits are comparable to other organizations."
good,This place was a good place to work  A little disorganized but they were just starting out in the area.  I really wanted to stay but it was too far for me to drive every day
good,"Seem to continuously making people redundant. Closing a lot of manufacturing plants and producing in far eastern countries plus india. No research and development, relying on old design and not updating tooling."
good,Hubbell is a great company to work for provided you ring the bell year in and year out.  Very performance driven culture where no one is irreplaceable.  Excellent training and opportunity for advancement.  Shareholder value is top priority and is the driving factor behind most decisions.
good,It is a fine company. I was working as a Facilities Engineering Co-op. My manager did not have enough projects for me to work on so I was left to figure out what to do with my day a good amount of the time. I did not gain as much experience as I was hoping for.
good,Needs more communication and to be more up front with temps good work place boring but has good benefits doesn't have long hours needs more than 1 break
good,"Great place to work, really great environment great pay. There is almost no chance of having a life apart from the weekend. Other than that would recomend this job for anyone"
good,"A typical day was usually filled with interesting conversations resulting in designs and sale of products that resulted in our product being # 1 in the industry."
good,"Very good benefits and the majority of the company is a good environment.  They have in house cafeteria, which is affordable."
good,"Fast paced work environment. Great opportunity to learn about the products and how the company operates. Diversity in the workforce, great people. Keeping up with daily challenges to reduce backorders.Knowing that top management reviewed my work, daily."
good,"If you're looking for perks and a fun modern work environment, it's not for you. It's a typically 40 hr a week job and your perk is that, your check, and a good work/life balance. It has high turnover that gets overlooked by upper management because a lot of the profitable product is commodity items so ""the numbers"" stay good. With that being said,due to a lack of people and high turnover you can get some good opportunities early in your career. Most of the high performers who get promoted through the ranks are people who have only worked at Hubbell. Hubbell either burns you out or promotes you to a position where tthe title you have and experience you're getting are hard to leave even if the compensation is low to average. People who come to Hubbell from outside of Hubbell tend to leave quickly. They've seen better elsewhere and just don't want to deal with bad management and a lack of foresight that seems to be constantly shown with a ""we've always done it this way"" mentality that comes from the majority of management being the only constant due to high turnover below management level."
good,"Has become too big, acquired too many companies and doesn't align them to all one process. Procedures went from 5-10 pages in length to over 60 in the span of a couple of years. Constant additional products and workload added. Additional freedom/trust and more work from home capabilities would improve morale."
good,"Now, let me clarify, our CS department is respected outside the company and with most outside sales. Internally, we are seen as secretaries and receptionist; much like the old days of a secretarial pool. It is very difficult to move outside this position within the company unless you have an engineering degree. And lets be honest, if you have an engineering degree, why are you working in customer service."
good,overall it was a good job and I learned a lot but it would be a difficult place to move up and or work long term it was a distribution center
good,"Work load is very business, but they did have learning meetings in order to keep up with the product knowledge of what we were selling"
good,"Hubbell Lighting, at least in the financial group, is a very static dynamic.  In order to advance it is suggested that you ""create your own new job"" to grow.  Being pigeon holed is commonplace.  Great people to work with but the consistent barriers to advance make it much less desirable and tolerable.  Salaries do not seem to match the average of the state but the benefits and work environment are top notch otherwise."
good,"Conservative company with strong financial position."
good,"Great managers, but no growth for engineers. Management forces development instead of letting engineers lay out front end work and vet out all possible scenarios."
good,"My day was usually ensuring that equipment and computers were running properly and the employees had the tools that they needed. I honed my managing skills working with employees and contractors. I worked with management within the facility as well with the cooperate office. I enjoyed the people that I got to work with, they were a good crew. The hardest part of my job was when there would be conflict between employees. I enjoyed most every day, I was able to get to know and work with most of the employees at one time or another in all parts of the facility."
good,"At the start of the day I would check emails and voice mails to see what the most urgent situations(s) needed to be handles first.  Then i would set up what needed to be accomplished in that day."
good,"The job was very detailed. You had to have extreme focus, quick hand skills, and patience. Communication was a must with this job because you had to often explain in detail what was wrong with certain machines in order for them to be fixed correctly and quickly. This job often do lay offs and could sometimes be considered seasonal."
good,"Learn more job skills, enjoyed fast paced work. Coworkers get along for the most part. Management and/ or planners didn't seem to know what they were doing."
good,I enjoyed my time and employment while at Hubbell. It kept me busy and occupied. I enjoyed working in a factory and working in a work station. I enjoyed being able to work on my own but also having my coworkers.
good,"Pay could be better. Not much training but it is pretty easy work once you get the hang of it. Easy going pace, most people are able to get along with the other and help you if needed."
good,Working to many Saturday the place is really hot in the summer for the job I received at Hubbell I had to take a pay cut didn't get a chance to become large box maker were they make the most
good,Pues es muy pesado por q es una fundidora y estamos espuestos mucho al calor
good,"People were nice Production manager made a point to say Hi to all employees and make sure things were going ok for everyone, Caring and put our families first."
good,Go in have a meeting about the work load for the day and how many hours we are gonna work. Management had poor communication with each other which lead to bad communication to the employees. Nothing really hard about the job.
good,"El área de trabajo tenía muchos problemas con la organización, pero nos daban muchas facilidades "
good,"Young adults or college kids would be a great summer job. The pay is ok. Management not professional. Lot's of favorites there. If you aren't in the ""in crowd"" you will never make it."
good,I enjoyed working at Hubbell. The money was fair but i needed to make more.I worked 2nd shift at that time I needed to be on first or thrid shift for my daughter
good,"Hubbel Power Systems is a nice work place. The atmosphere is pure of hard work and determination. With long hours, the option to make great money there is there."
good,"This was just my engineering co-op position, but it had a fun machine shop the allowed me to learn metal working and welding on top of electrical skills."
good,Involved with training and approving of lighting tests as well as manage the entire lab operation.  Coordinated more than 50 engineers/eng. managers testing needs through a lab facility.  Developed Labview software programs to reduce errors and ease operations
good,Good job for a first start not a good retirement place no benefits just somewhere to go to make good money for a first job some people may think otherwise
good,I had a good time working there. It is very hot and a fast production depending on what department your put in. I worked in pc making concrete lids for electrial boxes.
good,"fast paced environment, multiple departments, easy to transfer between departments, average pay compensation, good benefits, good work place environment"
good,"it was a productive environment.  The whole time you are at work your doing something productive. We mad electrical  concrete boxes out of rocks,sands, and cement."
good,This is a decent establishment to work for. Earning are effected by production incentive although I dont feel Hubbell provides enough compensation considering the chemicals that are handled all day.
good,There is a lack of communication and lack of teamwork. They have decent benefits and the starting pay is good. Management seems to not really care about what goes on out on the floor.
good,Challenging work at times great co  workers  wish it was more overtime and wish it was more opportunity for advancement also wish it was more cross training for other department
good,"I enjoyed my time there. The people were great and they work very hard."
good,Hubbell has been good to me as my first company to work for out of college. I have had good luck moving up but only because of constant pressure on management and outstanding job performance. As a large company mobility can be slow and adaptation of new processes take some time. Overall Hubbell is a good company to work for that provides good benefits to its employees.
good,Busy ever changing challenging days working in a union environment.  Most people were very nice and appreciated quick turn around to their questions.
good,really enjoyed my time there lots of long days plenty of hours per week
good,"Started day with a 15 minute meeting with supervisor to tell everyone what their production was the day before and to tell everyone where and what their assignment was for the day. I learned how to drive a stand-up forklift, worked with sanding machine, stud-driver and how to build arresters for powerlines. I enjoyed meeting new people and working together. The hardest part of the job was trying to get the production. The most enjoyable part was working with other people."
good,The job tent to be repetitive. Whatever learn on job can only be used on this job. Opportunities for promotion is slim. Most employees will remain in the same position no matter length of employment.
good,Co-workers are great to work with but a very difficult corporate environment to work with.  
good,"in HUBBELL , Remove and replace defective components and parts such as conductors, resistors, semiconductors, and integrated circuits, using soldering irons, wire cutters, and hand tools. Assembled and repaired, ordered all needed parts."
good,Learned and originated SAP system that has helped me to become more desireable to companies
good,"Responsible for receiving, stocking, handling, inventory and all other distribution activities. Perform basic warehouse operations and other assigned task. Picking orders for daily shipments, including loading responsibilities."
good,"It's tough, stressful, but you're compensated for that. Culturally, we tend to not recognize that employees are not necessarily motivated by a desire to burn themselves out in search of self actualization through ""work""."
good,"Hired as a supervisor, turned out to be an ax man. There is a very strong Union presence. Supervisors are not allowed to do their jobs. If supervisor/worker confrontation happens, worker always wins."
good,"People is polite and willing to help you but the back order takes a lot of pressure to the production line, there are a lot of areas from which you can learn from the basics to more complex stufflike painting process, welding, machining (CNC) and bending."
good,I like it everybody gets along pretty well great environment to work you usually do the same work everyday it's repetitive so it might get boring sometimes
good,"Good benefits and pay."
good,"The personnel in Hudson are the best I've ever worked with - team-oriented, friendly, courteous and hard-working.  Definitely the best part of working at this plant."
good,"I was proud to work at Hubbell until about 2 years ago. At that time Hubbell made significant management changes that have introduced turmoil and significant stress to the work place. There have been many missteps managing the business, that include unrealistic corporate goals and poor planning for future growth. Last, the last two years has seen several restructuring and numerous layoffs. It is an exhausting place to work. "
good,"Good company to work for. Had reached the peak position possible in the location that I as employed in."
good,It is a decent place to work but not very fair treatment from management. There is a severe lack of communication. The benefits are good and pay is very decent.
good,"Hubbell provided me with my first taste of professionalism. I worked there for a total of seven years including my time as a temp and five years as a full time employee. I received instruction and certification on several different forklift models. Typically I would pick and fill orders and at times complete the whole process of picking, packing, and shipping the order. I learned the international shipping requirements and the best ways to stack product to avoid damage. I did not have any chance for advancement do to the fact that most of the jobs that were posted were already earmarked for friends and family of management. Often people were hired alongside the job winner to help hide incompetence. The most enjoyable part of the job was frequent overtime and decent pay."
good,"Good company to work for.  Stayed busy all day, planning and scheduling factory floor and scheduling ship dates on sales orders.  Management was in the background, and not approachable."
good,"Nice company to work for, nice people. I resigned because of the wages were a little low for the type of work is asked of you."
good,I started here as a temp employee and thought I would become full time but the position was located in another city. The people I worked with were very nice and a job to be around.
good,Foundry work can be some very nasty and hard work. With such a wide variety of equipment there is never a dull moment. They offer good job security and benefits with a fairly laid back atmosphere.
good,"Fast pace company, not much career advancement. Colleagues are nice and helpful, lots of international employees, mainly Mexicans. Average benefits, start with two weeks paid vacation. 401k match up to 8%."
good,pull oders loading unloading shipping and receiving. learn more about the products types of shipping and functions
good,"It is an okay job and cmopany. Im was an injection molder. pay was okay benefits ere also decent, the 401k could be better........................................"
good,"I found the employment to be very accommodating to, because I had an situation. H R representative did a favor for me and I was able to return at an other opportunity."
good,"I have taken a project management course and I have learned New Product Management. However, no one in the company actually cares about this process. :("
good,I have worked for hubbell for almost 6 years now as a recieving clerk. Really enjoy my job but the environment has became very stressful. Money is not the most important thing to me. I am looking for a fresh start...
good,I liked working at Hubble it was very fair an a good job to have I got alone with everyone very while an was fun working at such a easy job it ran it self
good,"Buen ambiente laboral, sin mucho estrés y gerentes comprensibles. "
good,"It is an ok place to work . Nothing seems to hard  . Safety is a goal , that is strived driving different pieces of equipment to get the work done in a timely manner"
good,This wasn't a bad job the work was easy but you're either on a mandatory overtime schedule or not with little notice of which schedule you'll be working.
good,Nothing to add management only cares about their bonuses not the people get penalized for having dr appointment family emergencies doesn't matter they show no caring about employees
good,There is a lot of mandatory overtime and they will change your hours a lot. Management doesn't listen employees with complaints. There is no HR on site most of the time.
good,plant closing moving to other location. put stock away from trucks and the assembly lines. working with friends and having fun. hardest part of job was having to many trucks showing up and not having the help to unload trucks
good,Hubbell Power Systems located in the Leeds area is a pretty big electrical plant. The hours are long with two mandatory Saturday's but overall it's a nice job.
good,gained a lot of knowledge over the course of the years and worked with a great group of people. My current supervisor was beyond anyone I could ever have worked with and showed me what I was capable of and very respectful.
good,I worked 17 years and  did a mostly self taught systems analyst job.  Unfortunately I was downsized and the job sent to India. I enjoyed the challenges and learning opportunities the job allowed me.
good,"Enjoyed working with my co-workers but due to the inept management, hard work is not appreciated. They don't value your skills and what you bring to the company. They will micro-manage and tells you what to do."
good,"One of the nice things about working for Hubbell Lighting was the ability to work without someone constantly trying to micromanage the job.  There were times that my boss would ask for some information he needed for a report or project, but other than that he just let me do my job."
good,I assisted in processing multi-state weekly and bi-weekly payrolls.  Made connections all across the country while assisting the local HR Representatives.
good,"Good work life balance, Work from Home option."
good,"not much to said, I learn a lot working for this company. My coworkers were very nice and helpful. If you want to advance in your career Hubbell offers tuition assistance."
good,"Pros: People are nice at work place. Communication is employee friendly. "
good,"Company itself is a great one to work for. Depending on the person you report to, you may or may not have a overall good experience. Great benefits. good work culture."
good,"It is easy to do your job and not worry about others, as long as you stay in your sector things should go smoothly. I don't like the last minute mandatory overtime interfering with my family time."
good,Hubbell is a god place to work. There is a mass amount of overtime and most are lucky to get a day off. Pay is decent. I wouldn't recommend for someone with a family unless they are ok with rarely seeing their family.
good,Good job for what it is. Just never know I’d yoy have to work weekends until that Wednesday. It’s usually a Saturday and Sunday that you have to work as well.
good,"I like being part of Hubbell"
good,"Most people have been there many years and are promoted from within. Senior plant management is verbally abusive of staff. Staff under him are afraid to say anything."
good,"Boa empresa, pessoas dedicadas, investe em todos e busca melhoria continua"
good,Typical day at work was good. Learned a lot about lean manufacturing. Management was tolerable. Workplace culture was accepting. Safety was a priority.
good,Overall enjoyed working here.  People are friendly and do everything they can to help you.  Job responsibilities are transparent and training is provided.
good,Great benefits and pay package is competitive.  Management will work with you and objectives/job responsibilities are very transparent which is great.
good,Buen ambiente de trabajo los compañeros de trabajo se prestan para ayudar a los de nuevo ingreso
good,This is a great place to work. I would recommend to someone who wanted to come here. The people are the best asset of the company and it is one of the things that keeps me coming to work everyday.
good,I enjoyed learning how to run a machine to make rods and driving the forklift. I also enjoyed the 12 hour shifts. I learned a tot. My co-workers were fun and easy to get along with.
good,"Worked from a home office, spent 80% of the time on the road calling on customers. Learned self-discipline and how to be a self-starter. Management closely monitored their outside sales reprentatives. Co-workers were invaluable to rely on for expertise and advice. Most tedious part of the job was filling out multiple reports. Most enjoyable part of the job was calling on cutomers, interacting with people."
good,There is a lot of floor activities mixed in with plenty of computer work. spread sheets and CAD work. coworkers make it a good environment. lots of knowledge to learn from senior staff.
good,"Established market share"
good,wonderful company if you are starting out. Learn tons of things to help advance you in the future but is not a job foe anyone who is trying to earn good paychecks and work consistent hours.
good,"It is a great place to work. My only complaint is the work place environment. I really enjoyed my employment for Hubbell, minus some of the other employees. I liked a couple of the supervisors. Management could use a little improvement. Also, stricter policies for co worker interactions. Other than that, I had enjoyed that company quite well."

Ahora ha cambiado y el enfoque es mucho mas a la ejecucion y por lo tanto han hecho un gran esfuerzo en renovarse y cambiar toda la cultura empresarial.  Han crecido mucho por medio de la adquisicion de compañias y eso hace que sea un ambiente muy cambiante.  La competencia y el mercado tambien favorecen que se privilegie la estrategia y el logro de objetivos por sobre todo lo demas.  Se aprende mucho sobre la parte comercial de un negocio y la estrategia para sobrevivir en un ambiente economico muy competido y a veces adverso.  La alta gerencia del grupo tambien se ha enfocado recientemente a renovar toda la plantilla de altos directores, inyectando sangre nueva y mucha adrenalina por medio de iniciativas muy agresivas de excelencia operativa, simplificacion de tareas y automatizacion."
good,"overall it is a great place to work. however they are more concerned with shareholders than they are with the employees, which is business. don't expect to get your foot in the door in just any position then move up and get paid accordingly... they only do 15% bump in pay from most current salary."

good,"Hubbell is a company that is very lean, especially in the Aiken area.  And they take pursuing minute gains very seriously.   I learned much at Hubbell, since it was my first job out of college.  It was a very ""trial by fire"" experience.  My co-workers are great, and very knowledgeable and helpful.  Management, in its pursuit of improvement from a 91% index, expects a lot of its employees.  In the process of getting what management seeks, they sometimes leave a sour aftertaste.  It is for this reason that my particular department has an unusually high turnover rate for salaried employees."
good,Growing company with the drive to improve the present machinery. Always an improvement project going on to make things better within the business. Appreciated for a job well done.
