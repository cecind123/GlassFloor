good,I treat the customers how I would want to be treated. I go beyond to make sure my customers are satisfied once they leave out of my department and out of my store. If they need assistance in another department I will help with the best of my ability. I can actually say I enjoy waking up in the morning coming to work.
good,Very well organized no complaints it is a very enjoyable work experience
good,"great pay "
good,"A typical day would include waiting for drivers and truck to show up so that the product could be unloaded and I would receive it to the proper area for transportation out of the warehouse to the correct stores. In my time at the warehouse I learned all receiving areas, how to operate equipment, and how to work in a warehouse environment. Our management team has an open door policy so any issues we have they are available to listen and do their best to help solve them or communicate to someone who could help us. The best part of my job are my co-workers. Everyone is always willing to give you a hand when it is needed and that is a nice feeling. One of the hardest parts of the job is our understaffing. Some days there would be 2 of us on the receiving dock with 15 doors a piece and trying to keep up sometimes was a bit of a challenge."

I learned a lot about growing in the company and how to get to higher steps of employment. My co-workers were as family. the hardest part of the job was losing another associate to a transfer. It always was a sad when someone was asked to come to another store because their skills were outstanding.
good,"The typical day at work is basically doing the data entry in early morning and filling medications. When the pharmacy technicians arrived, I start seeing the scheduled patients for healthy heart screening which include diabetes, hypertension, cholesterol, and weight management screening. The pharmacy technicians usually referred the most of customers to me for full counseling. I also reviewed the post fill medications on daily basis. I enjoyed working with everyone in the pharmacy include the customers. The hardest part of the job is to convince the patients to adhere to their diet, exercise, or a proper intake to their medications. I enjoyed the team work in the pharmacy. The co-workers and I  acted as one. We were very organized in term of rotating and covering for each other. We really made the heavy volume of scrips very easy to deal with. Whatever part of the job that I have done was super dual-able to deal with and that's because the cohesive of the pharmacy team that we had."

Being able to change someone's day with something as simple as greeting them is priceless. The most difficult part is not being able to satisfy some customers needs not out of neglect or effort. Making my coworkers believe in small or large companies know they can make or break the company as an individual or as a team. Ive learned that in high stressed, high paced, situations or times that take a deep breathe assess each situation one step, one person and adjust accordingly and before you know it everyone is happy."

I know every company is ran differently so im just tryin to learn the small detail such as how to stack pallets properly. Management is very detailed, because dealing with food you must be very careful so they stay on top of us to sure we stay safe. The environment is great everyone is down to earth and work and we work well together. The hardest part of the job is stacking the pallets. If you don't stack pallet properly it will fall. The greatest part about the job is the pace."

good,"On an average day I would be expected to look and act presentable, answer queries from customers and handle any returns with care. I would give knowledge of jewelry including value, rarity, history and beauty. My management team was very involoved in our day to day activities including sales, repairs, ordering, recieving and diamond events where the vendors would bring their personal selection of jewelry and by contract we would sell a minimum amount of value within an eight hour period. My co-workers were there as my back up incase of a faultering sale, or a second opinion, this is vital for a strong team to work as one. The most difficult part of this job would have to be careing for all customers at once during the rush of the holidays. My favorite part of my career here would be the customers themselves, finding the perfect item for that special occassion and seeing the look on their face when they know I have given them a full and most enjoyable shopping experience."
good,"Helping customers with finding products and answering any questions or concerns they have,  taking orders and requests over the phone."
good,"This store had loyal customers, great products and variety. I liked working there and was one of the faster cashiers, while still packing their groceries politely. I started out sorting cans and fixing the can machines when full, also getting carts from the parking lot. The customers were great, many would come to my line if they were regular customers especially in a hurry, was great talking to them and helping them do a ""carry-out"", helping them with their groceries and products to the vehicle if possible and/or needed. Would definitely work here again."

What I learned at work is to always greet the customers with a smile, and leave your personal problems at home. The management team at work is very helpful when it comes to answering questions I do not know the answers to. My co-workers are a lot of fun to work with, and they are like a second family to me. The hardest part of the job I think is to try and remember all the things you got to remember. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people I work with."

good,"A typical day at work was that I clocked in to work, I went to each register that needed assistance with bagging groceries, I had to be faced paced to keep the lines going I would say welcome to Kroger to the customers that were coming in when I was bagging other customers groceries, I would ask the customers how would they like their groceries bagged when they came to the register and ask how has their day been and tell them I hope they have a great day. I have learned that everyone is different that everyone has different needs and wants, and asking someone how their day has been makes them feel more comfortable around you, and telling someone hello or have a good day gets a positive result than not saying anything at all. The hardest part of the job is being on my feet for a long time, my feet would be sore from walking back and forth.
